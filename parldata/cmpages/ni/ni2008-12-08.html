	      <p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Is mian liom a  thairiscint go gcomhaonta&iacute;tear an Dara C&eacute;im den Bhille Oideachais 2008.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the opportunity to open the debate on the  Education Bill. It is the first of two Bills that together comprise the most  significant legislative programme in education for many years. I know that the  Assembly will take a keen interest in the proposals, and I look forward to a  stimulating debate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Before outlining the scope and general principles of the  Bill, I will set it in context by reminding Members of the underlying policy  intentions. No one could doubt the fundamental importance of our education  system, but it is worth reminding ourselves of its core purpose as set out in  the Bill. Education is about more than schooling: its aim is to contribute to  the spiritual, cultural, social, intellectual and physical development of  children and young people, and of the community at large, and to build confident,  creative citizens.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The education system embraces children and young people  from birth to the age of 19 and beyond through the provision of services as  diverse as Sure Start schemes, schools and youth clubs. As I said in the House  last week, it is that public service, more than any other, which has the  potential to shape and guide the development and life chances of young people,  to build strong cohesive communities, to drive and fuel the economy, and to  build respectful and active citizens.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Is &iacute; earn&aacute;il an oideachais an dara cl&aacute;r is m&oacute; caiteachais  phoibl&iacute; at&aacute; againn anseo, le buis&eacute;ad de bhreis agus &pound;2 billi&uacute;n gach uile  bhliain. .</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Education is the second largest public expenditure  programme here, with a budget of more than &pound;2 billion each year. It is  delivered by nine statutory organisations, more than 1,050 schools, over 200  early-years providers, over 2,000 youth organisations, more than 50,000 staff,  many non-governmental organisations, and thousands of volunteers who serve in a  range of roles, from school governors to youth-group leaders.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The education system is not merely a significant public  service, but a precious resource. It is right, therefore, that the proposed  reforms will be scrutinised and debated thoroughly today. The starting point  should be the purpose of those reforms.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My aim is not merely to streamline administration or to  reduce bureaucracy, but to have a more effective education system, with  effectiveness measured in the terms that matter most to children and parents: a  broad education system, educational attainment and the fulfillment of  potential. In order to achieve that, we need better planning of the education  estate and delivery of the curriculum; better support services for schools and  other education providers; more local delivery of services, but within a  consistent policy framework; and freedom for school leaders to manage and  innovate with clear accountability for outcomes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Two themes are central to achieving that, and which run  throughout the Bill: new structures and new relationships. In reforming the  structures, let me make it clear that the deficiencies are in the current roles  and arrangement of the organisations, not the people who work in them. Over the  past 35 years, many thousands of staff have served with dedication and  distinction in the various education organisations, often in very difficult  circumstances. They deserve recognition and appreciation for all that they have  striven to achieve. However, the structures have become obsolete.  Organisations, many of which were established as a temporary measure in the  early 1970s, have been allowed to linger for far longer than they ought to have  been. New organisations have been grafted onto the system, but not in a  coherent way.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The educational challenges have changed beyond all  recognition since then, as have the needs of children and young people.  However, the education system is still largely based on a 35-year-old temporary  solution. Devolution and the new institutions present an opportunity for a new  approach that is fit for current needs.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Is l&eacute;ir go bhfuil g&eacute;argh&aacute; le hathruithe san earn&aacute;il  oideachais. Ar an 25&uacute; l&aacute; de mh&iacute; na Samhna leag m&eacute; b&eacute;im ar an ng&aacute; pr&aacute;inneach le  hathch&oacute;iri&uacute; chun dul i ngleic le tearcghn&oacute;thacht&aacute;il oideachais agus  neamhionannas, agus ba mhaith liom b&eacute;im a leagan ar an bpointe sin ar&iacute;s eile.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The educational case for change is clear. On 25 November, I  emphasised the urgent need for reform in order to tackle education  underachievement and inequality, and I repeat that call today. The current  fragmented system of education has manifestly failed to tackle those issues and  cannot be allowed to continue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">How can we justify five different approaches to education  delivery, in everything from special education to fees for music tuition? How  can we accept the complex variety of relationships between schools and support  bodies? How can we go forward when there is no clear focus on planning the  estate or on ensuring that every school is a good school? How can staff work in  a system in which accountability is confused and opaque? How can there be  equality when the services that children and parents receive are determined by  where they live, not by what they need?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When I spoke in the Assembly two weeks ago, I gave figures  that showed clearly that our education system is failing many of our most  vulnerable young people, such as those from working-class communities,  Travellers, ethnic minorities, children with disabilities, school-age mothers  and carers, looked-after children, victims of violence &mdash; particularly those who  suffer as a result of violence inside and outside the home &mdash; and victims of  homophobic and other forms of bullying.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will not repeat all those figures, but one may illustrate  better than any other the urgent need for reform. The most common measure of a  school&rsquo;s performance is its pupils&rsquo; achievement of five good GCSEs, which is  the level of qualification that is a gateway to higher education and often to  employment. The latest figures for non-grammar schools show that 45% &mdash; 6,844  children &mdash; achieved that goal. While some improvement is evident and welcome,  that figure shows just how far we still need to go.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Too many young people do not get what they need from  education, and every part of our education system needs to do better. Closer  scrutiny of that headline figure reveals a variation of results across our  fragmented education system, pointing to the need for change. In  Catholic-managed, non-selective schools, almost 49% of pupils &mdash; 3,510 children  &mdash; gained five good GCSEs. In controlled, non-selective schools that figure was  41%, which represents 3,334 children.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A gap of 8% is simply unacceptable and is clear evidence  that the current system cannot deal effectively with underperformance. Why are  schools in one sector consistently outperforming those in another? At this  point, I reiterate that there is no room for complacency in any sector. The  only possible conclusion that can be drawn is that good practice does not cross  organisational and sectoral boundaries. We need a single organisation that is  responsible for raising standards in every school in every sector, and in doing  so, that organisation must be clearly accountable to me and to the Assembly. I  therefore propose to create such an organisation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Make no mistake: the educational case for change is paramount,  but the financial case is also compelling. That is reflected in the business  case for the reforms. I have asked for copies of that business case to be  placed on my Department&rsquo;s website and in the Assembly Library. The business  case shows clearly that by the third year in the first phase of the reform, it  will be possible to redirect &pound;20 million a year from administration to  front-line services. That is not an insignificant amount. In subsequent phases,  service delivery can be improved radically in a way that will release even  further savings in order to enhance the quality of services that are available  to schools, youth services and non-governmental organisations.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">To put that in context, the overall quantum of savings  would cover the cost of building three new primary schools and one new  post-primary school every year. It would also cover the cost of around 700  newly qualified teachers every year or it would fund the Youth Service capital  building programme four times over. I have said that our education system is a  precious resource. It is incumbent on me and us all to do everything that we  can to ensure that the most effective use is made of every penny that is  available to education for the benefit of all our children and young people.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am confident that the job reductions that will free up  resources can be achieved through voluntary redundancies and early retirement  in managerial and administrative posts. Every effort will be made to avoid  compulsory redundancy. Front-line services will not be cut, and the majority of  staff who wish to play a role in the new organisation will be able to do so.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A LeasCheann Comhairle, c&eacute; go bhfuil athr&uacute; eagra&iacute;ocht&uacute;il  iontach t&aacute;bhachtach, caithfear caidrimh nua agus modhanna nua oibre laistigh  d&rsquo;earn&aacute;il an oideachais bheith ann freisin.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although organisational change is important, it must be  accompanied by new relationships and ways of working within education. Let me  be absolutely clear: the education and skills authority (ESA) will not be a  bigger education and library board &mdash; it will be a new and different type of  organisation, with a new and different role.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Schools, other education providers and children will be at  the heart of the new arrangements. The education and skills authority will be a  single, decentralised organisation that is fit for purpose, equipped to help,  support and, where necessary, challenge schools in the pursuit of improved  standards and in closing the attainment gap.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As part of my considerations on the establishment of the  education and skills authority, I will take into account the Bain Report on  decentralisation of public-sector jobs, and will seek to locate the education  and skills authority&rsquo;s headquarters in line with those recommendations.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is already plenty of evidence on the characteristics  of successful schools. Those schools tend to have strong, effective leadership  from their boards of governors and senior management teams; a strong sense of  belonging and accountability in respect of the pupils, parents and communities  that they serve; an ethos that pupils, parents, staff and governors support;  and the autonomy and support that they need to manage their own day-to-day  affairs.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The education and skills authority must foster and develop  that approach for all schools. There must be a move away from the  command-and-control approach that is all too prevalent in education. Instead,  school leaders will be empowered to lead, manage and innovate; be supported to  deliver; be held to account for their performance; and be challenged, where  necessary.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Is iad seo na tr&eacute;ithe a bhaineann le c&oacute;ras oideachais at&aacute;  nua-aimseartha agus &eacute;ifeachtach, agus creidim gurb iad na tr&eacute;ithe seo na  tr&eacute;ithe ar ceart do thuismitheoir&iacute; agus do dhaoine &oacute;ga bheith ag d&uacute;il leo.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those are the characteristics of a modern, effective  education system. I believe that parents and young people have the right to  expect those characteristics to prevail in schools.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A LeasCheann Comhairle. I turn now to the legislation. The  Bill that is before the Assembly contains a range of provisions to make the  vision that I have described a reality. I will explain the principal provisions  in broad terms. First, the Bill captures in legislation the visions and values  for education. It links them directly with general duties of my Department and  the education and skills authority that are centred on children and young  people&rsquo;s development.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, the Bill will establish the education and skills  authority, with the following core functions: planning education; introducing,  for the first time, a co-ordinated approach to the education estate and  curriculum throughout all sectors and providers; supporting education, with  clear statutory duties on the education and skills authority to support schools  and boards of governors; challenging education, through setting out clear  statutory responsibilities for my Department, the education and skills  authority and boards of governors; and employing staff, through establishing  the ESA as the employer of all staff in all grant-aided schools in order to  allow for a better planned and co-ordinated education workforce.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As an organisation, the ESA will be founded on democratic  accountability. The majority of its members will be local councillors. Its  objective is effective, responsible local delivery of services within a  consistent policy framework. The ESA must be a regional organisation and have a  strong local presence and focus on local delivery. Local managers and delivery  units will have the freedom to respond to specific local circumstances and  need. They will be sensitive to and receive input from local committees that  comprise, among others, several elected representatives.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill also contains provisions to dissolve existing  statutory organisations and to transfer their staff, assets and liabilities to  the education and skills authority. Those provisions are consistent with  guiding principles from the Public Service Commission and with the review of  public administration in other areas.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Tugann an Bille for&aacute;il d&rsquo;aistri&uacute; r&eacute;imse feidhmeanna &oacute;  eagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; at&aacute; ann faoi l&aacute;thair chuig an &uacute;dar&aacute;s um oideachas agus scileanna;  lena n-&aacute;ir&iacute;tear ceapadh ghobharn&oacute;ir&iacute; scoile, sol&aacute;thar sheirbh&iacute;s leabharlainne  na scoileanna agus araile.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill also provides for the transfer of a range of functions  from current organisations to the education and skills authority, including,  for example, appointment of school governors; provision of the school library  service; and raising standards. Building a broad curriculum is at the heart of  the Bill, which places clear statutory duties on my Department, the ESA and  schools. In addition, it provides for more effective education inspection  arrangements in order to ensure that there will be a clear evidence base from  which to celebrate success and challenge underachievement.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill also seeks to strengthen and underpin child  protection arrangements in education. That will ensure consistency and clarity  of roles and responsibilities across the entire education sector and provide  for strong powers to intervene, where necessary, to protect children. Further  provisions will place the funding of early-years services in education on a  formal statutory footing for the first time.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill aims to maximise the autonomy of schools by, for  example, giving them the authority to draw up the governance and employment  arrangements that they will operate. In relation to the curriculum, the Bill  will make my Department responsible for accrediting qualifications and  approving courses of education.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A LeasCheann Comhairle, is &eacute; seo an ch&eacute;ad Bhille oideachais  a cuireadh os comhair an Tion&oacute;il &oacute; athbhuna&iacute;odh an cineachadh, agus is &eacute; an  reachta&iacute;ocht oideachais is t&aacute;bhachta&iacute; &eacute; le gl&uacute;in anuas.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">This is the first education Bill to come before the  Assembly since the restoration of devolution and the new institutions. It is  the most important education legislation in a generation, and it will lay the  foundations for a new approach to education. It is an approach that is based on  the recognition of diversity, the promotion of equality and the achievement of  high standards. It is an approach in which we aim to make every school a good  school and support every learner to achieve her or his full potential. It is an  approach in which every governor, principal, member of staff and child feels  valued for what they do and empowered and supported to do it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is a system in which leadership and innovation is encouraged,  success is celebrated and underperformance is challenged. It is an education  system that will put the child at the centre. Molaim an Bille don Tion&oacute;l. I  commend the Bill to the Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education (Mr Storey)</strong>: I will speak first as the  Chairperson of the Committee for Education, and then I will make some comments  as the DUP&rsquo;s spokesman for education.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee has carried out considerable scrutiny on the  underlying policies of the Bill. On 26 November 2008, the Committee heard from  senior departmental officials in respect of some of its outstanding concerns on  a number of policy issues. Certain members of the Committee, including me, have  significant concerns about several aspects of, what I will call, the first  Education Bill. Some of those aspects will impact on the second education Bill,  and I understand that the aspiration is for that Bill to be introduced to the  Assembly before the summer of 2009.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee considers it important for its concerns to be  brought to Members&rsquo; attention and be placed on the record at this stage. The  first concern is the timing of the two Bills. The Minister regards them as a  single legislative programme and as two Acts that are intimately linked.  However, her proposed timescale for progressing the Bills through the Assembly  places the first on the statute book before the 2009 summer recess and the  second on the statute book by 1 January 2010, if possible, but certainly no  later than 1 April 2010.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, the Minister&rsquo;s plan is for the substantive  provisions of the first Act to commence on 1 January 2010 and for the  provisions of the second Act, if completed, to commence on that date also. The  Committee will be questioning senior departmental officials on that and on  other related matters on Wednesday.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">One of the Committee&rsquo;s key concerns is whether the proposed  education and skills authority will actually deliver local services to schools.  The Committee needs clarity on the make-up, role and powers of proposed local  committees and how those will relate to local managers of the education skills  authority. The Committee also needs clarity on the functions of the new education  and skills authority&rsquo;s sectoral non-statutory organisations. The Committee  considers that their precise role and functions need to be clarified. In  particular, the Committee needs to examine the body that will represent the  controlled-schools sector, because it will contain a diverse range of  interests.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee received a paper on that topic recently, but  no consultation has taken place with stakeholders to date. The Committee will  scrutinise that matter carefully.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Area-based planning of the future schools estate is another  key area. Based on the Committee&rsquo;s scrutiny to date, it appears that, despite  the proposed legislation, the Department cannot &mdash; or will not &mdash; stop individual  school sector development proposals, which are contrary to the principles of  holistic area-based planning frameworks, for many years. That issue must be  addressed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill makes the education and skills authority the  single employing authority for teachers in grant-aided schools. The Governing  Bodies Association, which represents 52 voluntary grammar schools, opposes the  proposals, which it believes diminish its autonomy and destroy the voluntary  principle and the diversity of voluntary grammar schools. That issue must be  addressed. The education and skills authority&rsquo;s single-employer status should  facilitate wider redeploy&shy;ment of teachers than is the case at present.  However, the exemption of teacher recruitment from fair employment legislation  militates against that notion. The Committee has confirmed that the underlying  policy on teachers&rsquo; exemption rests with the Department of Education. That  issue must be addressed sooner rather than later.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department&rsquo;s policy paper on the ownership of  controlled schools has recently arrived with the Committee and will require consultation  with relevant stakeholders. The Committee needs to scrutinise that important  area carefully. Furthermore, all school sectors must address complex issues on  the dispersal or disposal of schools and arrangements for the distribution and  use of surplus funds and proceeds of the sales of assets. Again, the Committee  will scrutinise that area in detail.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee is awaiting information on the second-tier  directorate structure proposed for the education and skills authority. Apart  from the costs, that raises issues on the roles and responsibilities of each  director. For example, the Committee sought clarity on the role of the director  of children&rsquo;s services, queried how that post will complement the work of key  partners in the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, the  Department for Social Development and the PSNI, and questioned how it will  integrate children&rsquo;s services. The Minister referred to the fact that &pound;50  million has been allocated to setting up the education and skills authority and  outlined the projected savings of &pound;20 million in year three. The Committee  hopes to receive more detail on that matter and raise questions on those  important issues.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will now speak as a private Member and as the DUP  education spokesperson, which will allow me more latitude and freedom. However,  I am not constrained by the Tory Whip &mdash; I have stayed with the DUP Whip.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As I said in the House previously, the Bill should not be  considered a blank cheque or a rubber-stamp exercise. During recent months,  much has been said about the relevance of the Assembly and the relevance of  devolution. If devolution is to be a success, it is essential that Committees  take their responsibilities and scrutiny roles seriously.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The legislation must be scrutinised, rather than simply  undergoing a rubber-stamping exercise.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to place on record, not only as Chairperson of the  Committee for Education, but as a member of that Committee &mdash; and I believe that  I can speak on behalf of all members of the Committee on this issue &mdash; that we  will dedicate ourselves and our work to ensuring that the legislation does what  it is says on the tin: that it can deliver what the Minister says it can; and  that it does deliver for our children and for the best of the education system.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are a number of serious issues with which we wish to  deal as the Bill is scrutinised by the Committee for Education. The single  employing authority, for example, is an issue on which, I believe, the Minister  has already received correspondence &mdash; and not from me, but from senior  churchmen in Northern    Ireland. The Minister has been very keen in  recent days to take advice from leading churchmen &mdash; perhaps she will consider  the advice of the bishop who wrote to her on the issue of a single employing  authority. One of my colleagues will deal with that issue in more detail later.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to an education advisory forum &mdash; do we really  need a civic forum for education? Do we need a body that will produce reports  and not have any power to deliver on those issues &mdash; as was the case with the  Civic Forum? I think that the jury is out on that one, but our decision is, I  believe, already very clear: that can add no value to the Bill.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On the subject of area-based planning, there is an issue  about whether that should be coterminous with the new council boundaries, and  what role there will be for local learning partnerships. Over recent weeks and  months, we had the opportunity to see the value of learning communities &mdash; there  are many in Northern Ireland  that are already delivering good, tangible outcomes for education. There are  concerns that there should be a holistic approach, that there should be  coterminosity with the new council boundaries, and that the role of local  learning partnerships is clearly identified.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill proposes the establishment of sectoral support  organisations. Assurances are needed that those organisations do not expand and  develop and take on a life of their own. How often have we seen such an  organisation going beyond the bounds of what it was originally intended to  deliver, as was the case with one of the organisations that is to be  dismantled. That is an issue on which we need to have a very clear view.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There must be clarity that there will be no dilution of the  position of school governors, and I will come back to that issue in a moment.  On the issue of the examinations function, there are concerns that there could  be a conflict of interest if ESA was responsible for the preparation and the  assessing of examinations. That issue will have to be considered seriously.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The DUP has always been concerned about the excessive  amount of change that is being attempted simultaneously across so many elements  of the education sector. As the Minister said this morning, the Bill represents  another era of change. However, we need to ensure that it is a managed change,  because far too often the system has been driven by directives from the  Department, but not by direction from the Department. There is a challenge to  us all &mdash; members of the Committee for Education, Members in the House, the  Minister of Education, the Executive and the Assembly &mdash; to ensure that that is  no longer the case.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">ESA offers the potential for streamlined decision-making,  reduced bureaucracy, and within a few years, hopefully, annual savings for  reinvestment in frontline services. We have expressed concerns about how  realistic are some of the short-term savings envisaged by the Minister. In  order to maximise efficiency, it is essential that ESA is as lean a structure  as possible, and is not top heavy, with too many senior management posts.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We will watch that space very closely. All too often in the  past, the aspiration has not become the reality; we must ensure that that is  not the case in this instance.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As a result of my party&rsquo;s perseverance, proposals that  would have removed the statutory entitlement of the Protestant Churches to  appoint transferors&rsquo; representatives to school boards of governors have been  overturned. I welcome that decision, which this House debated and can regard as  a success. Representative bodies such as the Council for Catholic Maintained  Schools (CCMS) are to be dissolved and replaced by advisory groups that have no  statutory or service-delivery responsibilities. A new body will be created to  represent the interests of the controlled schools. Many Members of this House  will welcome that decision, to which we will give due consideration over the  next few weeks and months.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We want, and support, greater autonomy for our schools. The  ethos of individual schools should be preserved. As a regional body, the  education and skills authority must have a high degree of accountability, with  the Education Committee having a meaningful role.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Governing Bodies Association (GBA) raised concern about  the voluntary principle. If the represent-ation that the Education Committee  received from the Department last week &mdash; that we have a system in which  autonomy is given to local schools so that they have the power to make  decisions without having to go through a bureaucratic rubber-stamping exercise  &mdash; is put in place, that will be welcomed by all sectors.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I should have declared an interest as a member of the board  of governors of a controlled secondary school. We would relish the opportunity  to have the power and authority that some voluntary grammar schools have. We  welcome that proposal, but we need to be careful in the way in which it is  brought about. Those are issues that we will continue to pursue over the weeks  and months.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Province-wide, consistent policies will now entitle all  pupils to the same services regardless of where they live. It will remove the  postcode lottery concerning issues such as special needs and home-to-school  transport.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">During the Committee&rsquo;s intense period of line-by-line  consideration of the draft legislation, my party will be to the fore. As well  as clarifying the exact detail of the matters that I have outlined, we will  particularly be examining the ramifications of the education and skills  authority as a single employing authority. A huge amount of work is required.  As we come to the end of 2008, we envisage entering 2009 with the purpose of  ensuring that the required work is done.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I lay down a warning. Concerns were raised about the  Libraries Bill &mdash; but can anyone tell me how the Libraries Bill was changed as  it progressed through this House? We must not make that same mistake. If this  House, the Education Committee and the Minister are to be relevant in  delivering the education of our children, this Bill must be scrutinised and  amended. I trust that the work that we envisage will be done in a way that will  benefit all the children in Northern    Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Listening to the remarks of the  Chairperson of the Education Committee &mdash; and in his role as the DUP&rsquo;s education  spokesperson &mdash; I find myself disagreeing with him on very little. However, I  reserve the right to study the Hansard report in case he slipped something in  that I did not pick up.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have no difficulty with &mdash; indeed, I support &mdash; the  Member&rsquo;s plea for the Assembly and the Committee for Education to closely and  robustly scrutinise the Bill. In fact, the Committee has already played a  positive role in developing the Bill, and anyone who examines the Minister&rsquo;s  public announcements about her changes to the legislation will realise that she  has listened to the Committee&rsquo;s opinion on many aspects of it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For example, the matter concerning transferors, to which  the Chairperson of the Committee for Education referred, was of serious concern  to many people. It has been decided that there will be no change to the role of  transferors on boards of governors, and that is the right decision. Transferors  from the Protestant Churches have played a positive role in the education  system, and they should be allowed to continue to do so. Therefore, I welcome  that decision.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Good.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  am being praised by the blue-rinse brigade from the Conservative Party. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span><strong></strong>Given that, and the fact that I  am agreeing with the Chairperson of the Committee for Education, perhaps I  should sit down while I am ahead.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As the Minister said, the Bill is not an exercise in cost  cutting; it is about improving educational outcomes for young people, and that  is how it must be measured. Excellent educationalists are working in the  education system &mdash; in classrooms and on boards &mdash; but we do not always have an  excellent education system. That system must be refined and managed in a way  that is accountable to local communities, the Assembly and broader society.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Another of the Minister&rsquo;s changes &mdash; namely that the  majority of ESA members will be local councillors &mdash; is to be welcomed, because  that will afford democratic accountability at the highest level. In addition,  the local committees, with which local managers will work and to which they  will refer when delivering services, will include locally elected  representatives, and that is important. It must also be remembered that ESA  representatives will appear before, and be held accountable by, the Committee  for Education and the Minister. Therefore, the proposed structure will be  subject to several layers of accountability.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I note that UNISON &mdash; a trade union for which I have a lot  of respect &mdash; is concerned that possibly the largest quango in western Europe  will be created. I do not believe that that will be the case, because the  safety measures that the Minister has put in place with regard to the  authority&rsquo;s membership and the membership of local committees, and those  bodies&rsquo; accountability to the Assembly, will ensure that the quango will not  run off with public resources.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  The Member disagreed with UNISON &mdash; a trade union for which he has a lot of  respect &mdash; that the proposals will create the largest quango in western Europe.  UNISON also stated:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;there is no evidence that the proposals will produce  improved educational outcomes on key indicators, such as numeracy and  literacy&hellip;the size of the proposed bureaucracy is likely to militate against the  local flexible support that schools need on these issues.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Does the Member agree with that statement?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  No, and there are several matters that have been raised by UNISON with which I  will publicly disagree today. Nevertheless, in the near future, I will meet its  representatives and I will debate those matters with them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">ESA&rsquo;s driving role must be educational improvement, and its  failure in that role would mean that the Assembly and the local authorities  would have failed hold it to account. However, we are not starting off by  envisaging failure &mdash; ESA must succeed and educational attainment in the schools  system must improve. Moreover, the support mechanism that ESA is legislated to  provide for local boards of governors is better than the existing mechanism.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have a lot of respect for UNISON &mdash; and for the trade  union movement &mdash; but that does not mean that I cannot disagree or interact with  it. This is the start of the debate about ESA, and in addition to people in  this Building scrutinising and debating its future, the trade union movement  will, quite correctly, debate and discuss its implications.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">ESA&rsquo;s ability to deliver in the future will depend on  resources, and that has not been fully debated. For many years, the education  system received increased funding through various initiatives.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, during future Budget considerations, the Assembly  and the Executive will need to step back and look at the way in which education  is funded and whether the sector is receiving enough finance to allow any  authority to ensure that improvements can be made.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">12.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have heard Members from all Benches say &mdash; correctly &mdash;  that primary education needs more resources. If that is to be achieved, the  entire education sector will require more resources in order to direct the  necessary funds into primary education and to allow the education and skills  authority to ensure that the necessary changes to, and investment in, the  education system will be successful.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I support the Bill for a variety for reasons, the most  important of which is that it is not about cost cutting or trimming services  and bureaucracy. The Bill must be about improving attainment in classrooms and  schools, and ensuring that our young people can be everything that they wish to  be. I welcome the fact that the Bill makes provision for the education and  skills authority to look after not only children&rsquo;s educational welfare but  their spiritual and pastoral welfare. Schools are not only about teaching the  three Rs; they are creating young adults for our society. Through its support  networks, the education and skills authority will be able to deliver that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I support the Bill, and I welcome the fact that the  Committee for Education will play a robust role in the system and that it will  scrutinise the legislation, in the words of its Chairperson, &ldquo;line by line&rdquo;.  There is nothing to fear from that scrutiny or from the proposal of positive  amendments to the Bill. However, amendments must add to the Bill rather than  detract from it. I hope that the Committee will not employ scrutiny as a  delaying tactic but will use it to provide positive input to the Bill.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Education has been waiting for change for many years. The  boards are losing staff at all levels, and, if we are to have a successful  education system in future, we must move forward. We need to introduce, as speedily  as possible, the review of public administration (RPA) changes that are  happening across all sections of Government.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, the Minister and the Department have listened to  the concerns about the two Bills. The two Bills are inextricably linked, to use  a catchphrase that I heard somewhere else. The first and second Bills are  linked because the Committee was concerned that it would be signing up to the  first Bill without knowing what the second Bill contained.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The commencement Orders that were outlined at last week&rsquo;s  Committee meeting should reassure Committee members who may be concerned about  signing up to a second Bill that they know nothing about. The Assembly will be  involved at all stages of the process, and, therefore, Members can feel safe in  their convictions that they are doing the right thing with regard to the Bill.  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I am somewhat confused by the debate. It was interesting that the Lord Morrow  felt the need to intervene. I note that he was sitting on the Front Bench but  has moved to the Back Bench. He is just checking out which way his party will  go in the debate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I was struck by the question about what was actually  agreed. I heard Mr O&rsquo;Dowd say that he disagreed with very little of what Mr  Storey said. However, if I heard Mr Storey correctly, he gave two separate  speeches &mdash; one on behalf of the Committee and the second on behalf of the DUP &mdash;  in which he gave a long list of things about which he was unhappy and which he  did not think were right &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If the Lord Morrow wishes to intervene, I will be happy to  let him. He does not need to speak from a sedentary position. He need only indicate,  in the normal manner, that he wishes to speak.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I considered the comments from DUP Members. I asked Mr  Storey whether a deal had been done. He assured me categorically that no deal  has been done on the Bill, and I believe him; he is an honourable man.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will be listening to the debate, as it progresses, and watching  to see how Members vote during any Division.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I was struck also by the comments of other leading members  of the DUP. When Sammy Wilson was Chairperson of the Committee for Education,  for instance, he said:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The proposal seems to be to move everything into the  centre in the longer run and put it into a grand regional education and skills  authority that will be remote, inaccessible and unaware of local concerns.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official  Report, Vol 28, No 4, p214, col 2]</span></span><span style="font-style:normal; ">.</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">He was talking about the Youth Service, of course.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I did not detect any great enthusiasm for the Bill from  that Member, and neither do I expect any from Miss McIlveen. On the proposal to  move the Youth Service into ESA, she said:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Youth services would have greater long-term security  if they were administered by local councils&hellip; We must ask ourselves whether  youth services would be better served under potentially the largest education  body in Europe. Would that reflect the current  situation &hellip;?&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official Report, Vol 28, No 4, p219, col 1]</span></span><span style="font-style:normal; ">.</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The Member makes some very good points, and I look  forward to hearing her develop them as the debate progresses.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am not sure whether we have reached agreement on the way  forward, despite what Mr O&rsquo;Dowd says. It seems that we have a great Civil  Service response &mdash; and I notice that that caused a few heads to pop up. In the  absence of policy, we have process. As Mr Storey said, we receive a lot of  directives from the Department, but not much direction. The wheels are  spinning, but there is no forward motion. We have not tackled any of the core  problems in our education system; we have not reached any agreement.  Furthermore, we have not found a way to deal with the transfer arrangements  from primary to post primary, with whether 14 is the appropriate age for the  consideration of those things, and we have not explored what we can do about &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  The Member is clearly confused, because his comments do not relate to the  objectives of the Bill, or to ESA, which is concerned about restructuring the  education delivery system and improving delivery services for education and  support services.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Basil McCrea said that I had disagreed with little of what  was said by Mervyn Storey, the Chairperson of the Committee for Education and  his party&rsquo;s spokesperson on education. Mr Storey read a list of issues that he  wants to scrutinise at a Committee meeting. Why would I disagree with his  wanting scrutiny to take place at a scrutiny Committee?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  There are many things that the honourable Member does that I cannot understand,  that being one of them. The Assembly is supposed to be trying to find  consensus, but that is not happening. Some people are bulling on blindly and  saying that they will do it their own way. That is an assault on democracy.  Proper debate is not being allowed to happen, because the outcome has been  decided already.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  missed the beginning of the Member&rsquo;s contribution in which he referred to me. I  do not think that he made any accusations about me, because he said that I was  an honourable man. Perhaps, he had too much to drink over the weekend, and his  vision is blurred.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If the Member believes that a deal has been done, why would  I come to the House and raise my concerns? One must remember what I said. This  is a litmus test for the Committee for Education, of which Basil McCrea is a  member. Will he assure the House that he, along with his colleagues and the  rest of the Committee, will suggest and consider meaningful amendments that  will, if necessary, ensure that the Bill is moulded in such a way that will  make it acceptable to Members, instead of saying merely what should be done?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cobain</strong>:  How can that be done?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  There is a legislative process. The Member is a Member of the Legislative  Assembly, or, perhaps, he has become a member of the Tory Party.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I understand the Member&rsquo;s difficulty. It is difficult for one to reply to a  statement that was made when one was not in the Chamber. Had the Member been in  the Chamber, he would understand that I was not attacking him; he has jumped to  a conclusion. I have heard what he has had to say in the Committee, I have  heard his personal opinion, and I know that he has grave reservations about  many aspects of the Bill.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If I am not correct, he can say so. I have asked the Member  personally, and he will confirm it; I have asked the appropriate people whether  a deal has been done. I have been given an absolute assurance that no deal has  been done.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Will the Member specify what he means by a deal being done? What does he  believe that the trade-off has been?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I am only making the position clear, Mr Deputy Speaker, that I have received an  assurance that no deal has been done: no deal on the 11-plus; no deal on  transfer; no deal on age 14; no deal on anything. In response, Mr O&rsquo;Dowd said  that I was not talking about the right thing. I am talking about the general  principles. I heard the Minister say clearly that the whole idea of ESA was to  tackle the underachievement in our society and to tackle issues of  underperformance. All those issues have been raised and will be looked at. My  comments are relevant.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We are fiddling while Rome  burns. We are not dealing with the real issues. The Bill is to make life easy  for the Civil Service. The origins of the issue started during direct rule when  a Minister would fly in, make a few decisions and fly out again. That is not  the case now. We have a Minister of Education &mdash; allegedly. That &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  We definitely have a Minister of Education.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I was just checking. Is it you or her?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  It is definitely her.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind Members to make their remarks through the Chair. Mr  McCrea has the Floor.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We want to tackle the underachievement in our society, and  we want to find a more efficient way of organising our education system. I  understand what the Member opposite said when he referred to budgets and  increasing funding in primary, nursery and other schools. The Minister told us  what she thought was the answer to the question that she had posed. She asked  why the underperformance was taking place. However, there is no real answer to,  or logical analysis of, why underperformance is taking place. The proposed  solution &mdash; while not being sure what the problem is &mdash; is to look at good  schools operating in difficult areas that produce good results, schools with  strong and effective leadership, schools wedded to the community, schools with  a strong ethos, and schools that have the appropriate level of autonomy so that  they can make decisions at a local level.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Education Bill will destroy all that and it will take  away from our schools &mdash; our most successful schools &mdash; the level of autonomy  that they need to make the right decisions for their community. It will not  provide them with any additional resources. It will burden them with an  overarching bureaucratic system that will take away from the effective  education that they provide. Therefore, I am extremely uncomfortable with the  direction of the Bill.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is easy for the Department to issue directives &mdash;  directives come out in multitudes. Our school leaders and practitioners are  overburdened with the amount of direction that they are given. However, they do  not receive the resources to implement those directions. We must find a system  that will provide some form of local accountability that lets practitioners &mdash;  leaders in their schools &mdash; do what is right for our children.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It struck me when speaking recently on the Health and  Social Care (Reform) Bill, brought forward by Minister McGimpsey, that Members  opposite supported the idea of creating a huge quango for health. They  understood why it is right, with regard to health issues, to have a certain  element to look after financial controls, or computer systems, or to deal with  certain matters on a regional basis, but they reject the notion that we should  have one super quango that handles everything for education. If it is good  enough for health, it is good enough for education. It is exactly the same  argument.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">One thing that really worries me is that the Minister said,  if I heard her correctly, that the Bill would introduce clear accountability to  me &mdash; I do not think that she meant me; I think that she meant her, the Minister  of Education.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The truth is that we are witnessing the introduction of  politburo politics. There is an absence of democratic accountability. Mr O&rsquo;Dowd  suggested that the Committee would somehow have an overarching view on the  matter. I do not see that provided for in the Bill. I see that the matter will  be passed on to another quango. Some unpopular decisions will be made. When we  are discussing other topics, some Members normally say that the Minister of  Education has the support of the unions, the educationalists, the stakeholders,  and of this, that and the other. The truth is that the Minister of Education  does not enjoy unilateral support. In fact, by uniting most of Northern Ireland  against her proposals, she has managed to achieve the near impossible. Had she  adopted a different approach, it might have been possible to consider the Bill  in a particular light. However, we cannot support a Bill that will give  unfettered control to a Minister of Education who does not listen to  democratically elected Members or to the teachers, parents, and, above all, the  pupils.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">1.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The proposals in the Bill appear to be the Minister&rsquo;s  attempt to gobble up the entire education system. Under the Bill, early-years  provision will also be put in the pot. There is a real danger that the  authority will take on too much, and that, like so many oversized  bureaucracies, it will strain under its own weight. Again, I know that the DUP  shared that view, or at least it did previously. No doubt, we will get  confirmation of that. The proposals for area planning were also a major  concern. Much of the content of the Bill will be greatly influenced by the  guiding principles by which area-based planning is conducted. That is an issue  of fundamental concern. If one does not know the rules by which the process has  been conducted, how can one have any confidence in the outcome?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">An equal concern exists that the education and skills  authority, being a single employing authority, will further reduce the  independence of schools and their ability to manage their own affairs, promote  their own ethos and maintain standards. Many teachers and educational  professionals are starting to question seriously what this Bill and its sister  Bill will mean for them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is further confusion over the education advisory  forum. No definitive policies have been developed. I am extremely disappointed  that the forum has not been included in the Bill, as it will have serious  ramifications for the ESA and its workings. The forum will advise not only the  Department of Education but the Department for Employment and Learning. It is  crucial that we gain full understanding of what that forum will entail as  quickly as possible.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill, in its current form, leaves as many questions unanswered  as it answers. However, we know that, when the Minister concludes the review of  public adminis&shy;tration (RPA) process, we will be left with a top-down,  centralised education system that will not address many of the most pressing  problems in education. It will not allow our excellent educational  professionals to flourish, and that will impact on our children. The Bill  offers a broad-stroke, ideological approach to definitive and real problems,  which may ultimately result in the removal of the best parts of our education  system across the board. The Ulster Unionist Party will not stand back and let  that happen. I urge all other parties to reflect seriously on the practical,  democratic and inclusive ramifications that the Bill will have for our entire  educational system and for our society.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Unionist Party&rsquo;s goal is to deliver an education  system that provides an excellent education for everyone in Northern Ireland.  The party also believes in encouraging education professionals, local  communities, councils and children to invest in, and engage with, the system  and its development. The Bill does not allow for such input. Moreover, the  party does not believe in destroying the parts of our education system that are  doing well in order to improve those areas that are not &mdash; that is misguided,  ideological thinking. As UNISON said &mdash; we have discussed this point before &mdash;  the Bill before the Assembly fails the classic principle of form following  function. I do not support the Bill in its current form, but I look forward to  scrutinising it further at Committee Stage.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I trust that all the Members who are here today will  understand that our concerns are legitimate and serious and that we are asking  for &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I was one word away from finishing.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: As  the Member knows, timing is everything. He alleged that the Bill is  ideological. However, his party &mdash; which has joined forces with the Conservative  Party &mdash; is opposed to the Bill, and, on the left wing, UNISON also has  reservations about it. Therefore, in what sense is the Bill ideological?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  For a minute, I was worried that Dr Farry was not going to intervene, but he  was fortunately able to come up with something. As usual, his erudite and  incisive brain has picked up on something. He probably saw it on the TV &mdash; that  is very good.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Unionist Party is a party of Northern Ireland &mdash; strong within the Union, dedicated to the education of our people, and  dedicated to ensuring that society improves for all of us. Dr Farry should, in  the words of our leader, Sir Reg Empey, join us.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm labhairt ar an Bhille  Oideachais inniu agus ar an &uacute;dar&aacute;s um oideachas agus scileanna. As an objective  witness, I can verify that Mr Basil McCrea called Mr Storey an &ldquo;honourable man&rdquo;  while he was out of the Chamber. That is the good news. The bad news is that  some Members shouted from the Back Benches &ldquo;so was Brutus&rdquo;. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When she introduced the Bill, the Minister said that she  was:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;not interested in rearranging bureaucratic  deckchairs.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official Report, Vol 35, No 6, p256, col 1]</span></span>.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">However, if the transfer issue is not resolved,  many people &mdash; especially parents and teachers &mdash; will see the advancement of the  Bill as the Minister ignoring the looming iceberg and proceeding full steam  ahead. We must recognise that there is still confusion, anxiety and uncertainty  among those who are affected most by the transfer issue. As we face a possible  situation of unregulation, the general public may view today&rsquo;s proceedings as a  rearrangement of deckchairs as we lurch towards a disastrous situation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Church leaders suggested recently that academic selection  at age 14 could be an area of agreement. The SDLP welcomed that possibility,  but alas, little progress has been made on it. We cannot afford to spurn that  opportunity &mdash; the public demand more than that from us.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For an area that is as small as Northern Ireland, the ESA will be a  huge organisation. That smacks of what is known as democratic centralism, which  is the way that Gerry Adams runs Sinn F&eacute;in. Regardless of how the education and  library boards were viewed, there was a perception that there was local access  to executives at the highest level and speedy responses to issues that were  raised.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A main issue that many people have about the ESA concerns  its local interface with schools and youth clubs. Although the Bill does not  detail such arrangements, it is worth putting down a marker that we expect easy  access to the ESA&rsquo;s services at a local level throughout the North. Access to  services and responses from the ESA must be a vast improvement on current  services; we do not want schools telling us that the level of access to &mdash; and  provision of &mdash; services is not serving their needs and is not of sufficient  quality.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The lofty ideals of legislation can appear laudable on  paper, but we need to ensure that their practical outworkings best serve  schools and pupils. Although we all agree with the aims of the Bill, especially  in relation to raising standards in education, standards cannot be raised on  fresh air alone. That requires considerable investment in resources.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We were promised constantly that the ESA would deliver  savings of around &pound;20 million per annum, which would be reinvested in  front-line services. However, recent statements from the Minister are putting  less emphasis on those savings, which makes one doubt whether they will be  realised.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If we are to support the Bill, we need solid assurances  that the projected savings are still an important element in the establishment  of the ESA. Schools will want to know that the promised savings are still  achievable and that they will be available to them for front-line services. We  need to ensure that the ESA delivers the promised savings and that it is  monitored and reported on annually to ensure that that happens.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We share the reservations of other Members, particularly  with regard to the examinations council. We believe that it should remain  independent, but it is difficult to see how that will happen if it is placed  under the control of the ESA. We need to give fresh consideration to that area.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, standards are a very important part of the  education system. We need to ensure that there are effective benchmarks at all  stages of the system. There is also a need for an accurate system of measuring value-added  data. The SDLP will ensure that the Bill &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  I am very glad that the Member raised the added-value factor. Will he agree  that it is that added value in the classroom and the relationships that have  built up over the years between the teacher and the children, the teacher and  the parents, the school and the community, the school and its local education  board, that have helped the existing system &mdash; badly framed as it might be, as  the Minister said &mdash; to succeed over the past 35 years?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  I thank the Member for his intervention. Given that many schools have achieved  a degree of value added, which is not always reflected in dry examination data,  we need a system that will reflect both that and examination outcomes. That is  the point that I wanted to make</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP intends to scrutinise the Bill closely, and our  support for it is not a given. Unless we can be sure that the Bill will deliver  on its stated aims, our support will not be forthcoming. We want assurances on  all the points that I raised. Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: We  welcome the fact that the Bill has been introduced at last. It is good to see a  substantial piece of legislation in the education field being brought before  the Assembly. I do not wish to repeat what the Minister said, but the broad  thrust of the Bill relates to raising standards across the board, to the fact  that the financial case indicates major savings from year three onwards, and to  the fact that we are not looking at a rehashed education board. Although we are  quite happy about that, that is not to say that we do not have some  reservations, to which I will come in due course.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In broad terms, however, my party welcomes the proposals.  We like the idea of a regional organisation with a strong emphasis on local  delivery and maximum autonomy for schools. Those concepts have been talked  about for months &mdash; years, even &mdash; and now that there is a possibility that they  will come to fruition, we will run with it.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">1.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I also welcome the fact that the Chairperson of the  Committee for Education &mdash; he has disappeared, and I wanted to compliment him &mdash;  has said that the Committee will take a constructive view and try to achieve a  consensus. I believe him; I think that he means it, and I believe that his view  is shared by a majority of the members of the Committee.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Basil McCrea asked whether a deal had been done. I do not  know &mdash; he has disappeared as well. However, he talked about the two parties  doing it their way; I think he used the phrase &ldquo;bulling ahead&rdquo;. I do not see it  that way. Over the past few weeks and months, I have witnessed a convergence of  thinking among most of the parties on the requirement for an ESA Bill. Now that  it is before us, I wish it a fair wind. Like other parties, however, we have  some concerns that we will develop during the Bill&rsquo;s Committee Stage and  Consideration Stage.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mervyn Storey raised the issue of sectoral interests being  allowed to carry on with major developments in advance of the Bill becoming  law. My party has a major concern about that. There is a situation in Larne  which is causing great concern. I do not see why some of those developments  could not be put on hold in the meantime. Mervyn is back now, but I will not  repeat my compliment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Our most serious concern is around the representation at  the top level of ESA, and the requirement that a majority of its board &mdash; if I  can call it that &mdash; be composed of local councillors. I am not declaring an  interest; I am a local councillor, so I feel that I can speak freely about  those matters. I will not repeat the comment that was made during a meeting of  the Committee, but let us just say that there is a possibility that only a  minority of members of that board will have the required expertise, while the  majority are there purely because they are local councillors, and to make up  the numbers. It may be that there will be enough local councillors with  sufficient expertise &mdash; I do not know. However, having taken note of the  performance of local councillors on the existing education and library boards,  I am filled with dread. The South Eastern Education and Library Board is in  suspension, and the Belfast Education and Library Board is in limbo; that does  not bode well for the future.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Why is the ESA board to be composed mainly of local  councillors? What have we done to offend the system? Schedule 1(19) of the Bill  states that Assembly Members cannot be members of the ESA board. The starting  point for all of that was the former Minister&rsquo;s view that there should not be  any democratic representation on the ESA board. We have gone from that position  to having a majority of local councillors. That is incredible; there must be a  sensible compromise between those two positions that allows for local  democratic &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  The Member may or may not know that the Libraries Bill, which was scrutinised  by the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure, was, in its early stages,  designed to render the proposed new libraries authority absolutely bereft of  any local political or community involvement. The Members of that Committee saw  that as a difficulty that would reflect what had happened in the health boards  over many years, and they were determined not to allow that to happen to the  new Library Authority. I am glad that the Minister of Education has accepted  that local councillors, in their new post-2011 format, will have some influence  in the running of ESA.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: I  accept the Member&rsquo;s point. He used the phrase &ldquo;some influence&rdquo;. I do not  believe that it has to be a majority influence &mdash; that is the point that my  party will pursue as the Bill makes it way through its Committee Stage.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  wish to generate a bit of debate, just in case people have gone to sleep. Just  for clarity, will the Member give his definition of &ldquo;democratic  accountability&rdquo;?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I hear the concerns of Mr Lunn, but can he tell us how we  move from a situation where civil servants control all the matters about which  Basil McCrea said he is worried? How do we ensure that organisations such as  ESA and other bodies that deliver for the community are democratically  accountable?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>:  Democratic accountability will come from the House and from the Committee for  Education. However, democratic accountability need not involve a majority of  elected representatives on such a board. The ESA will require a certain level  of expertise, and I am simply not convinced that a majority of local  councillors can provide that expertise or that there is any need for a majority  of the board&rsquo;s members to be elected representatives.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If would be fair enough if, instead of six out of 11 or  seven out of 12, that there were three or four elected representatives on the  board, as long they brought the required expertise to the job. The ESA is to be  the biggest education body in western Europe &mdash; on what basis that claim is made  I am not sure &mdash; but it will be massive and it will need expert leadership.  There has been a change of mind, because some Members who wanted no democratic  accountability at all on the board now want a majority.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>:  Aye, why not. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I share the Member&rsquo;s concern about the reasons for excluding MLAs from the  process, and I am interested to hear his thoughts and suggestions on that  matter. Will he expand on how he thinks Members might be more properly brought  into the oversight?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: No;  I do not wish to expand on how MLAs can be brought into the oversight, as Basil  puts it; however, I see no good reason for excluding them.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>:  Aye, certainly. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  If MLAs were members of the board of ESA and were also charged with overseeing  the work of that board, would there not be a clash of interests?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>:  That is possible. Surely by now, however, Members know how to deal with  conflicts of interest. If a conflict of interest arises, there is a protocol to  deal with it: MLAs can withdraw or not take part in a particular discussion. A  conflict of interest is not an insurmountable problem; the same thing happens  in councils. Surely, there is room at the lower levels of the ESA structure for  plenty of local councillors to provide input on their areas, which is perhaps  where their influence will be most valued.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I share Basil McCrea&rsquo;s concern about the future of the  Youth Service and where it naturally lies, and I agree with him that there is a  good argument for involving the new local councils in the control of those  services. We have concerns about the accountability of ESA generally. However,  that said, the Bill is a document for negotiation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I get the impression that parties in the Assembly have had  a considerable change of view about the future of the ESA and whether it can  succeed. I listened to Dominic Bradley&rsquo;s point about the looming iceberg of  transfer issues &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  And regulation.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: And  regulation. Six months ago, I thought that ESA was a looming iceberg; suddenly,  it is not. A consensus is developing. Who is to say that, with good will and a  fair wind, we cannot develop a consensus on the other pressing major issues? I  would not like to say that a deal might have been done, but it is possible that  there are understandings.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  There has been no deal.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: No,  there has been no deal, but under&shy;standings might have been developed. Who  knows? However, the matter will involve all Members. Today, we are taking a  step forward, which I welcome. I look forward to working with the Committee on  taking the matter forward.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  The Education Bill, together with the Bill that is to be introduced in 2009,  could mark what is probably the most important and fundamental rationalisation  of education in Northern    Ireland. However, if it is handled  incorrectly, it could lead to one of the biggest tragedies in education, which  could ruin a generation of pupils. The legislation is an opportunity for the  Assembly and the Minister to demonstrate a capability to put aside party  politics and sectarian policies and to take a step towards creating the  framework for an education system that is fit for purpose, cost-efficient and  non-discriminatory.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that the Minister does not adopt her  now-familiar approach of digging in her heels but that she takes time to  listen, digest, rationally consider and, I hope, adopt any reasonable  suggestions that the Committee for Education and Members may make about the  legislation. The Minister&rsquo;s way cannot be the only way, and I ask her to  approach the subject in a more reasonable manner than she has approached the  issues of academic selection or Irish-medium education. By now, she must surely  realise that being aggressive and dogmatic achieves nothing but an aggressive  and dogmatic response.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I do not wish to repeat much of what has already been said.  Unlike Basil McCrea, who took 20 minutes to get to the point of outlining some  of his concerns with the Bill, I will deal with my concerns more directly. My  colleague Mr Storey has already listed areas that need further attention, and I  intend to focus on a few of the issues that need further clarification and  which must be urgently addressed by the Minister if the Bill is to be a  workable and acceptable piece of legislation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The first issue is that of the single employing authority,  with which clauses 3 to 12 of the Bill deal. It is a centrepiece provision that  will result in the establishment of employment schemes in which the education  and skills authority will issue employment policies for staff and guidelines  for the appointment of staff in grant-aided schools. The intention for the  education and skills authority to become the single employing authority is not  only to ensure that common employment policies apply throughout the grant-aided  teaching profession but to facilitate easier sideways movement between the  sectors for staff.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, why have the Minister and her Department not  made any approach to OFMDFM to seek an amendment to the Fair Employment and  Treatment (Northern Ireland)  Order 1998, given that employment as a teacher in a school falls outside the  scope of that Order? The Minister repeatedly tells us about equality of  opportunity, partnership and fairness. I want her to step up to the mark in  that regard and request that the 1998 Order be amended in order to facilitate  true equality of opportunity to all teachers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister really believe that it is fair to  continue the practice of requiring a Catholic teacher-training certificate to  teach in a particular sector? Is it not time that the Minister showed in deeds,  rather than in empty words, that equality is her primary objective? In order  for her to do that and to bring to fruition the spirit and intention of the  Bill by creating a single employment authority, she must address that gross  discrimination. If the Minister fails with that, there is no point in the  single employing authority provision being enacted.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Despite the promises of her Department from a year ago to  approach the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister (OFMDFM), I  understand that nothing has been done. It is not good enough that the Minister  and the Department continue to sit on their hands over the issue. Will she  undertake to the Assembly today that she will petition OFMDFM to introduce  legislation to ensure that that hurdle to fair and equal employment is removed?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Under clause 21, the education and library boards and the  Council for Catholic Maintained Schools are to be dissolved. The Northern  Ireland Council for Integrated Education and the Irish-medium representative  body are not statutory organisations, and, therefore, they do not have to be  dissolved through legislation. However, the Bill intends to create sectoral  support organisations for Catholic maintained schools, integrated schools and  Irish-medium schools. The Minister must clearly confirm that a similar  organisation will be created for the controlled sector.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">What role will those organisations play? Why are they being  retained? What will the existence of such organisations cost the taxpayer? What  limitations will the Minister place on those organisations to ensure that they  do not seek to extend their influence beyond that which is intended by the  Assembly? All those questions are quite reasonable, and we should quite  reasonably expect an answer from the Minister. When considering the  establishment of a body such as the education and skills authority, which is  intended to make efficiency savings, the taxpayer is entitled to know whether  there is good reason for retaining other bodies that will be a drain on  resources.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">1.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Equally, the taxpayer is entitled to know the extent of  that drain. Furthermore, if we are serious about having an education and skills  authority, we must be extremely wary of creating or retaining organisations  that will seek to erode and undermine that authority, otherwise, what is the  point of ESA? It is only natural for a sectoral support organisation to seek to  expand its influence and to create a role for itself. We need only look at how  CCMS expanded its role without further legislation. Therefore, it is vital that  the Minister clarifies the position about the issue at the earliest possible  opportunity.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has expressed her intention to begin  recruiting for ESA. My party colleagues and I feel that that is potentially an  abuse of the system. At present, there is no legislative status for recruitment  to that body, and to begin a major recruitment at this juncture could have a  considerable negative impact on the education system. I understand that there  is a need to hit the ground running, if and when ESA takes control, but where  will the staff to fill those ESA positions come from? The obvious answer is that  they will come from the existing education and library boards. Existing vacancy  control restrictions, while intended to reduce the possible need for compulsory  redundancies, have left holes in the system, which will grow at a fast rate as  more staff move to the embryonic ESA or leave the system altogether.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Does the Member agree that we have already had experience of that with regard  to the education and library boards? A convergence followed from that  legislation. Does the Member agree that it is vital that, in the interim  arrangements, the staff and expertise of existing boards converge with the  needs of the new body? In that way, we can avoid losing that expertise because  employees have decided that their interest and input are not wanted.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms McIlveen</strong>:  I agree with my colleague absolutely. The problems that this may create are  twofold: there could be an experience deficit in ESA, but more pressingly, all  this may present problems for existing organisations and, in particular, for  boards discharging their duties in the final lap of their existence. The net  result would be a detrimental impact on the education of children.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister must tread carefully and explain to the Assembly  how she intends to ensure a smooth transition while maintaining high standards  of administration delivery to the education system.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There must be continuity of service, and the current  organisations must maintain their capability to function up to, and including,  the final day of their existence. Until they cease to exist, those  organisations &mdash; not ESA &mdash; will deliver the huge volume of essential front-line  education services. The continuing need and entitlement of young people to  education services will be as great today as it will in six months&rsquo; time, or in  the final weeks of the boards&rsquo; existence. It is for the Minister to ensure  continuity.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The boards cannot afford to be winding down while they are  winding up, and to avoid that, the Minister must not allow ESA to asset-strip  the boards of talent, or to diminish morale within those organisations by  recruitment to ESA before a legislative basis exists for it. To do so would  disregard due process and the rightful role of the Assembly in ensuring proper  scrutiny of legislation. Members would be faced with a fait accompli, in the  form of appointments that would be costly to freeze or reverse; and such a  reversal would waste public funds and cause embarrassment to the Minister and  her Department.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Moreover, while there must be some movement of high-level  staff into ESA in advance of the takeover date, that will not be necessary  until the autumn of next year, and, even then, it should be subject to the  first Bill having completed its passage, and the second having been brought to  the Floor of the House. Any other arrangement would put the operational cart  before the legislative horse.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister must also ensure that all her energies are not  focused on establishing ESA; she must also support and sustain the existing  structures to ensure maximum delivery. For the sake of young people, it is  vital that she does not take her eye of the ball.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is also vital that the Minister does not simply employ  outside staff at ESA; were she to do that, ESA, when it becomes functional,  would not have the benefit of the valuable skills and experience of those who  currently work in the boards.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Will the Member comment on the issue of the Youth Service in the new system,  which is a matter that she has previously raised in the House. Does the Member  still believe that the Youth Service will inevitably become:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the Cinderella service of the Department of  Education&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official Report, Vol 28, No 4, p219, col 1]</span></span>.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">&mdash; if kept within the ESA? Does she still support  moving the Youth Service to the councils?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  Obviously, the Member has digressed from the point that I was making. However,  I have previously placed those beliefs on record, and I still hold them. I will  bring that view to the Committee when we examine the Bill.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Returning to the point about employment within the ESA, it  is vital that such skills and experience be harnessed, not ignored. It must be  made clear that there will be a transfer of staff into the ESA. Clearly, there  are very committed staff at all levels in education, and they will continue to  work hard to deliver the best possible services, as they have until now.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is hard to be fully enthused about something until one  knows whether one will have a part to play, and what that part will be.  Furthermore, it is natural that questions are being asked by education staff in  respect of whether they will still have a job, what that job will be, and where  they will be working.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is essential that the Minister and the Department keep  morale high throughout that period of uncertainty, and the only way that that  can be achieved is through full disclosure and consultation. If morale  deteriorates, so will the service that is provided, and that will ultimately  affect the education of children. The Minister and her Department must avoid  that situation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As for area-based planning &mdash; an issue that is mentioned in  passing in the Bill &mdash; that process must be carried out based on the proposed  new council boundaries. I ask the Minister &mdash; as the Chairperson of the  Committee for Education has already &mdash; to clarify what role local learning  partnerships will have. The Committee believes that those partnerships have a  valuable role to play.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to highlight several matters &mdash; which other Members  have already mentioned &mdash; for which the Committee deserves a great deal of  credit. Much has been said about opposition to the ESA in the past, but the  Committee has fought hard on a number of issues and has achieved vital  concessions that have allayed a number of its fears. More still needs to be  done, particularly in relation to teacher employment and equality, but the  Committee is mindful of the concessions that have been achieved so far. That is  particularly the case in respect of the retention of the transferors on boards  of governors, the removal of whom would have caused greater inequality in our  schools than currently exists.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A further concession that has been gained by the Committee  is an assurance that a second Bill that deals with the ESA will be presented to  the Assembly before the Final Stage of the Education Bill. That means that the  House will be able to ensure that the promises that have been made in respect  of the new authority are realised in legislation, and that there will be local  delivery of services &mdash; which the Committee felt would have been lost in a huge,  centralised quango. Such safeguards for education have been established as a  result of the hard work of the Committee and these devolved institutions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, I agree with the concerns that were  highlighted by the Chairperson of the Education Committee. The matters to which  I have referred are not an exhaustive list of concerns in respect of the Bill &mdash;  clear guidance must be provided by the Minister and her officials. We have an  opportunity to make a significant change in the schooling of our children and  young people, and that opportunity should not be missed or incorrectly implemented.  I ask the Minister to carefully consider the issues that I have raised and to  respond appropriately.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  Education is one of most important elements in any society. It is particularly  important that we get matters right in respect of the administration of our  education system.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Back in the early 1970s, the education and library boards  were introduced. Those boards replaced the previous system, and have been with  us for 35 years or so. Therefore, it is important that we get any new system  absolutely right, because that is of primary importance in delivering a  good-quality education system in Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Over the years, there have been several attempts and  various proposals to reorganise the administration of education. For example,  there were proposals to reduce the number of boards, but that initiative fell  by the wayside.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We now seem to be on the way to change, but it is important  that it be the right change. Change in itself is not necessarily a good thing &mdash;  it can be change for the better, or change for the worse. It is important that  we make sure that it is change for the better.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister spoke about a system that is effective and  efficient. Those are hopes and aspirations with which everyone concurs. I will  add a third &ldquo;e&rdquo; to that list: the system should be equitable as well as being  effective and efficient. It should also be fair to all the different sectors so  that none is advantaged and none disadvantaged &mdash; as has, unfortunately, been  the case in the past. It is clear that there are deficiencies in the current  system.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister went on to say that the current system is  failing certain groups, and she listed some of them. It is true that certain  groups in our society are not achieving the educational success that they  should be achieving. However, many factors militate against academic and  educational achievement; the structure &mdash; the architecture &mdash; is but one of them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that in the process that we are about to start in  the new year, the role of the Committee will be properly recognised and that  every opportunity will be taken by, and given to, the Committee to scrutinise  and amend the Bill as appropriate. It is absolutely imperative that we have  enough time to do that job thoroughly. The issue is complex, and there are many  aspects to it. We need to get it right.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister spoke about harmonisation across the different  areas of the Province. It is understandable that there is criticism when a  youth club in one area, and under one system, receives funding, while, in a  different board area and under a different system, another youth club does not.  It is important that there is equity across the Province.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In speaking of equity, I return to my earlier point:  primary equity must be between the different education sectors. As my colleague  Michelle McIlveen said, some progress has been made. A number of issues have  been addressed; but more needs to be done. I hope that we have the time to make  those changes in order to get a good result from the process. I welcome the  fact that the second Bill will be introduced so that we can see it before the  first Bill completes its course.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A number of specific issues will emerge over the coming  months. There is certainly an issue regarding the single employing authority,  about which two of my party colleagues have already spoken. There is the issue  of the Roman Catholic teacher training certificate, which is something that has  been discriminatory. That is not just an issue for Catholic schools, it is an  issue for integrated schools in which some teachers have been required to have  the certificate in order to teach in that sector. People from both Protestant  and Roman Catholic communities have come into my constituency office to express  concern about that matter. Some of them have taught in Catholic schools and in  integrated schools in England  but were not able to gain employment in Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is also an issue concerning the working environment.  Some years ago, the education and library boards drew up a protocol with the  trade unions about the working environment in schools and what constituted an  appropriate working environment for staff. That protocol did not apply to all  teachers, because the boards did not employ teachers in the Catholic sector &mdash;  they simply employed ancillary staff in the Roman Catholic sector. However,  that will become an issue, because it is not just about the recruitment of  teachers, as regards the Roman Catholic teacher training certificate; it is  also an issue about the nature of the environment in which those teachers work.  During the course of the year, we will need to tease out the implications of  that very thoroughly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are also issues around the architecture as regards  the sectoral support organisations. That has been touched on already by my  colleagues, and I will not repeat what has been said, but it is one of the most  obvious areas of inequality and unfairness in the current system, and has been  a major source of grievance.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Sectoral bodies already exist, such as the Council for  Catholic Maintained Schools, and in a different form as regards integrated and  Irish-medium schools. However, the rights and interests of the controlled  sector have hitherto not been adequately or properly represented. In the  future, equality must be ensured.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">1.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has a love and deep affection for the word  &ldquo;equality&rdquo;; she talks about it constantly. Meeting that equality will be one of  the most fundamental tests of what emerges from this process. The current  system has given distinct advantages and preferential treatment to some sectors  over others. The DUP, and I as an individual Member of the Assembly, will  ensure that that equality test is applied fully, thoroughly and fundamentally  throughout the process. We will not sign up to anything that does not deliver equality.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As a member of an education and library board, I am  concerned about the impact that the recruitment of staff will have on boards  during the interim period. We have already seen a negative impact on the  library authority, with staff disappearing into the new body or simply disappearing  into early retirement. I am concerned that there might, in the coming year, be  a situation whereby the embryonic authority, in shadow form, would strip away  senior staff from the boards. That could have a detrimental effect on the  education service delivered to schools in that interim period.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have a concern, too, about membership of the board. I  understand, and I may be wrong, that to become board members, candidates will  have to apply and be interviewed. I do not know whether the Minister will set  an 11-plus-style test for them. Perhaps it should be a 40-plus test, but there  should be some type of test. I do not know how the Minister will do that  because she is obviously very much against testing. However, whatever board  emerges, it must be truly representative of all Northern Ireland and all sectors,  and be a board on which there are the requisite skills to provide a good  service to schools.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My colleagues spoke about autonomy for schools. It is clear  from presentations that were made to the Committee for Education that local  schools want to have maximum control over their own affairs. That is something  for which schools made a strong case. How will the Bill affect that autonomy?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">What will be its impact on area-based planning, and on  local issues such as procurement processes? Will there be some sort of  subregional structure to carry out procurement processes in different areas?  What will be the nature of any subregional structure, as was proposed for the  library authority, and how will it be brought into effect? That which is  appropriate for Belfast  may be more than slightly different from what is appropriate for the  north-west, or for Fermanagh or Tyrone. It is important, therefore, that we get  the whole package before making any final decisions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I share the concerns of my colleague Michelle McIlveen  about the Youth Service. As a result of experience in, and involvement with, the  Youth Service, I know that the Youth Service often has a very close relationship  with community services, and with services that are delivered through local  councils. Therefore, I am not fully convinced about proposals that the Bill should  incorporate the Youth Service. The Youth Service is already poorly treated,  with a single Department dealing with education and youth. In the past year, the  Youth Service has been seriously underfunded because the Minster decided to  deprioritise it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I fear that having a single authority to deal with all  those things might be a temptation for another de-prioritising of youth. If the  Department and the Minister are doing it, what is to stop ESA doing it? That  leads to the series of caveats, concerns and reservations that we have  outlined. Nevertheless, there is a strong case for having a single, overarching  authority. I hope that, over the next year, the Department gives the Committee  the opportunity to ensure that all that is required is done in order to produce  a good result.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  I declare an interest as a governor in two controlled primary schools.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Many Members have drawn attention to the equality issue  that the Minister must address. No longer should we have a one-way street that  allows teachers to move from controlled schools into maintained schools, but  not the opposite way because of the certification requirement. I hope that the  Minister will address that; it is a fundamental issue of concern to the  Committee.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Nelson McCausland reminded us of previous attempts to  reorganise education. At one stage, the five boards were to be reduced to  three; however, a decision was not reached on whether it should be east, west  and Belfast or north, south and Belfast. A political balance was required but  could not be struck, and, therefore, the five boards remain.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am concerned about the potentially draconian powers that  will be assigned to the ESA as a central body. Those powers are most worrying,  and it is difficult to understand how anyone in their right mind would approve  them without the most careful consideration. I am glad to hear that my  colleagues on the Education Committee have decided to treat the proposal with  utmost caution.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In their current form, the proposals are unacceptable, and  will make it difficult for schools to attract and keep governors. At a meeting  last night, I was speaking with governors who are already expressing fears that  their current duties are much more than when they took up their posts. The  duties that may be imposed by this legislation frighten them quite  considerably.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We have also heard that the proposed reorganisation will  lead to difficulty in dealing with the myriad local issues that schools face  daily, and to which the education and library boards respond quite effectively  and in an understanding and professional manner.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister&rsquo;s inability to establish clarity about the  transfer arrangements leaves the whole landscape of education reform somewhat  unclear. What is the point of creating structures for the sake of doing so,  without the transfer procedure being agreed in advance? The Minister&rsquo;s approach  to the issue of transfer means that it is not unreasonable to say that the  Ulster Unionist Party is concerned about the proposals that she has indicated  will be in the Bill. Members are also aware that waiting in the wings is the  second, unseen Bill, which is another cause for concern.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Indeed, there seems to be some confusion about the  statement made recently by the Minister on this subject. At that time, my  colleagues and I were given inadequate time in which to consider the statement  that she made to the House. We were not sure which of the two scripts that eventually  emerged was the one on which the Minister should be questioned.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If the Minister of Education moves the Bill forward, there  is the risk that the ESA will grow like Topsy &mdash; becoming uncontrollable in  size. The ESA will become too remote to deal with individuals or schools on  smaller, day-to-day, absolutely fundamental issues. The manner in which the  boards have responded to them in the past, although not perfect, has been  understanding, and the boards have built up a reservoir of interpersonal skills  that have been most useful in many difficult situations that never reach the  media or the white ivory tower of the Department of Education headquarters in  Bangor. Officers on the ground who are trusted by schools&rsquo; principals and staff  dealt with those situations.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Ulster Unionists are also concerned that the legislation is  proceeding in two parts. That means that we are not seeing it in its totality.  Therefore, the ultimate, rather than the intended, outcome is just not known.  If the first Bill is agreed without the maximum amount of scrutiny, who is to  say what will be introduced in the second Bill? Those are some questions that,  unfortunately, remain unanswered.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Given the Minister&rsquo;s declared intentions, and her approach  thus far, it would be naive and foolish not to give the most detailed and  rigorous scrutiny to any move that she makes on this or any other issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Some people have referred to the curriculum, as proposed,  as a &ldquo;Trojan Horse&rdquo; that would be used as a vehicle to effect significant  change. That is the sort of disturbing sentiment that implies the wholesale  destruction of, rather than building on and expanding, what is currently best  in the system. Many people see an ideological agenda at work, which is directed  by the Education Minister and implemented through a large quango, namely the  ESA. Many people also suspect that that agenda will, ultimately, dismantle  existing good practice in schools, instead of building on it and extending it  across the wide range of abilities and interests with a far greater and more  sensible emphasis on the key basic skills of reading, writing and mathematics.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I refer back to the Minister&rsquo;s opening statement comments  about underachievement. How many times must it be reinforced that all those  widespread, wholesale changes for the sake of change are not needed? Many  problems that concern the Minister and the other Members in the Chamber could  be tackled simply by investing properly and systematically in early-years and  primary education.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister must talk to her colleagues in secondary  education, grammar schools and further education. She must talk to whatever  stakeholders of whom she cares to think. They will all tell her the same thing:  without basic foundations, the house will fall down.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The world is a difficult place. It gets more difficult by  the day due to the credit crunch and the economic downturn. The Assembly will  do children no favours if they are thrown into a woolly curriculum instead of  being prepared for real life. That is why the education debate must be based on  firm educational grounds, rather than on some woolly agenda. That is why the  direction that education will take must be decided upon before a big  bureaucracy is created to drive forward something that is as yet undecided.  Surely, cause must predate effect.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I refer to another comment about a new and different type  of body. It has been said that Members do not understand what the new ESA is  all about. We fear that we do understand. In the debate, the Minister said that  the new body will drive forward and challenge schools. I ask who will challenge  schools. From where will the necessary expertise and experience come? Where  will the credibility of those persons be established?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Will it be in the educational world, which, for the past 30  years, has wrestled with civil unrest, yet created an oasis of peace and  tranquillity in schools and maintained educational abilities and attainments?  Or will someone be drafted, or parachuted, in who has no experience or  interpersonal skills in dealing with schools as corporate bodies and with the  communities that they represent as cohesive units? There is, therefore, much  about which I am concerned.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I loved the little t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te across the Floor of the  House between John O&rsquo;Dowd and Mervyn Storey, in which John would not disagree  too much with Mervyn &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  And Mervyn would not disagree too much with John.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  Oh, I do not know about that. Mervyn, being an honourable man, will, of course,  speak for himself.</p>
	      <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr McClarty] in the Chair)</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">An awful vision of &lsquo;Blue Peter&rsquo;  flashed across my mind: it was a &ldquo;Here is one that I made earlier&rdquo; scenario.  John O&rsquo;Dowd said that the education system must be refined. If it simply needs  to be refined, why must it be smashed down and built back up again? If a  vehicle exists that delivers something that merely needs to be refined, surely  only the mechanic is needed to work at it? The scrapyard man does not need to  arrive on the scene.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The boards are losing staff. That is a serious issue, with  which I want to deal. The ESA implementation team is out there talking to board  members and different sections of the boards&rsquo; staff. Presumably, that exercise  is meant to reassure people and to focus reform. However, one piece of writing  that came before me asked how local is local? There will be regional delivery  and local area support teams. I envisage labels going up on doors along  corridors throughout the country. We have seen all that before.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">One might ask what a local area support team is. It is a  multidisciplinary team that works directly with schools in youth-work settings  to provide all the support and advice that they require on a day-to-day basis &mdash;  and here comes the punchline &mdash; within an agreed regional framework. Therefore,  those local area support teams will do all those wonderful things, which we all  wish for and applaud, but they will do it within a regional framework that will  be pushed right down from the top.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">What is the change going to be? What impact will the new  system have? How local is local? Are we talking about the new council  boundaries or the existing education and library board boundaries, or will  there be a blurring of both? Local groups have worked well in Limavady,  Craigavon, Strabane, and elsewhere. What will happen to the hard work that  those professionals have undertaken to ascertain and address the real problems  and to produce an agreed solution?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Some questions remain, and the jury is still out. However,  we will scrutinise the Bill firmly and fairly. As has been said, we cannot  afford to get this one wrong.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  broadly welcome the fact that we are examining this piece of legislation and  moving the process forward. The review of public administration &mdash; which was  started by the previous Member to speak&rsquo;s party &mdash; commenced a long time ago,  and progress has been limited. Education is one key area where change needs to  be made.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I do not have a great deal of affection for the  multiplicity and tiers in the current system, in which five boards and numerous  other bodies oversee education. Different boards have different standards and  priorities, which means that there is not the consistency that there should be  across Northern Ireland.  We broadly welcome the Bill and the opportunity to examine the legislation, but  that does not mean that we going to give the Minister carte blanche by  endorsing every aspect of the Bill. There are aspects of this piece of  legislation that the Committee and Members of the House will seek to change. I  urge the Minister to demonstrate a willingness to co-operate on the sensible  and rational proposals that Members and the Committee will make.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I require much more clarification on the role of the  subregional bodies. I am concerned that they will create more layers of  bureaucracy than are necessary. The information that we have been given about  those bodies is light, and more is needed. I also have concerns about the  intervention powers that the ESA will have to challenge the autonomy of local  governing bodies. It has been indicated that the ESA will not micromanage, but  the legislation needs to outline that clearly. The ESA must allow some autonomy  at local level, particularly in local schools.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am also concerned that the Council for the Curriculum,  Examinations and Assessment (CCEA) will lose its independence, and that the  legislation will make it part of the ESA. It may be beneficial &mdash; in order to  sell our education process outside Northern   Ireland and for young people who wish to attend universities  outside Northern Ireland  &mdash; to have an examinations body that is clearly and wholly independent of the  education process. It may be in the wider interest to ensure that CCEA is  clearly identifiable as an independent arbitrator.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  Does the Member agree that it is vital that our education system&rsquo;s  qualifications are recognised across the UK and throughout the world? The  Member has firmly and fairly made the point that our high standards must be  recognised and must correlate with high standards elsewhere.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  agree; it is crucial that qualifications gained in Northern Ireland are independently  credible. That is why I put down that marker.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members mentioned the Youth Service. Many of those  services are community-led and would be better managed by councils in  association with education bodies. There is a clear linkage, and both sectors  should work together, with one taking a lead role. Councils are, probably,  better placed to take the lead role and to work closely with the education and  skills authority to ensure delivery. I look forward to scrutinising the  legislation during the Committee Stage.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  support the Bill&rsquo;s Second Stage and welcome the progress to date. I am pleased  to see detailed legislation, particularly in the field of education, on the  Floor of the Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I concur with the broad rationale and the aims and  objectives of the education and skills authority. Educational administration in  Northern Ireland  is inappropriate for a region of its size and population, and there are too  many strands of bureaucracy. It is more important to release funds to invest in  front-line services that will benefit pupils and equip them with resources such  as IT and books. Moreover, that invest&shy;ment will allow teachers, and the  classroom assistants who ably support them, to continue to provide that  service. That is how resources should be deployed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill identifies that delivery of the proposals will,  potentially, cost more than &pound;40 million. Although I appreciate that this exercise  will incur reorganisation costs, I am slightly concerned &mdash; from a Finance  Committee rather than an Education Committee perspective &mdash; by the degree of  that commitment. However, the potential savings of &pound;19 million a year are  attractive. It will be interesting to see whether the reorganisation costs can  be recovered within two years or whether that process will take longer. All  Members will have an interest in that matter.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Does the Member agree that we need to have more than &ldquo;interest&rdquo;? We need to  ensure that the predicted savings are realised.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  agree. The issue of savings does not lie directly with administration &mdash; as  important as that is &mdash; but lies in the functioning and delivery of area  planning and sustainable schools. Those areas are closely linked to the  creation of the education and skills authority.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is massive duplication in the Northern Ireland  schools system that is caused by bureaucracy and the provision of buildings.  Area planning is important in order to make progress on providing a modern  schools estate that is fit for purpose and that enhances the opportunity for  pupils from different sectors and back&shy;grounds to interact and avail themselves  of various courses in different settings. The major challenge is how the  education and skills authority will facilitate the robust progression of that  area-planning process. If that process is successful, the potential savings to  the system &mdash; which will be available for reinvestment &mdash; should dwarf the  potential &pound;19 million saving on bureaucracy. Although it is a work in progress,  it is an exciting opportunity that will, potentially, benefit the public purse  and the welfare of children in Northern    Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I am pleased to hear that the Member considers it an exciting opportunity and  that he is only &ldquo;slightly&rdquo; concerned about the financial implications. Has the  Alliance Party given up its role of official opposition? Does it now fully  endorse all proposals introduced by the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in, or will it play its part  in the democratic process?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  The Alliance Party, since its formation, has always played its part in the  democratic process in Northern    Ireland; we are not in the Assembly to  provide opposition for opposition&rsquo;s sake &mdash; as some have accused us of doing. We  are here to judge each proposal on its merits; we back DUP proposals if we feel  that they are the correct way forward &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  When?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Rare as that may be, before Mervyn gets too excited. At times, we will favour  Sinn F&eacute;in proposals. That is what the electorate of Northern Ireland expects of all in  the Assembly: that we judge issues on their merits rather than playing party  politics and judging proposals accoreding to the party proposing them. We are  here to focus on the issues and the good of the people of Northern Ireland  rather than engage in point-scoring.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party is here as a constructive opposition,  and where we find that things are failing, either through the content of  proposals or the absence of progress on particular issues, we will not be shy  in raising those issues, as we have done over the past 18 months of the  Assembly. We look forward to continuing in that role. Of course, there will be  details in the Bill that will have to be addressed at Committee Stage, and I have  full confidence in my colleague Mr Lunn to address them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On the issue of the level of elected representation on the  board of ESA, we must accept that the context of democracy in Northern Ireland  has changed significantly since ESA was first envisaged. We now have full  proper devolution at a regional level through this Assembly &mdash; I hesitate to use  the term &ldquo;stable democracy&rdquo;, but I hope that the system that we have will be  durable and that we will not be subject to the stop/start politics of the past.  It was appropriate for people to advert to the problems of bureaucracy in  Northern Ireland before devolution, given that locally elected representatives  did not have much say over decisions that were taken &mdash; in fact, few people in  Northern Ireland had much say over how decisions were made.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  Does the Member agree that one of the reasons that people in Northern Ireland  did not have an input to democracy was that there were so many quangos in  operation during that period? Perhaps his party had some experience of those  quangos.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Given that it chaired most of them.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  The reason that we did not have democracy in Northern Ireland was not a matter  of quangos; they were a response to the inability to sustain a form of power  sharing at a regional level in this place. Several factors contributed to that,  but it is not constructive to go into history in any greater detail.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As for local accountability, the primary body to hold ESA  to account should be the Assembly &mdash; specifically the Committee for Education. I  am not convinced that six or seven councillors from across Northern Ireland  can provide the missing link of democratic accountability. First, they will not  represent each of the 11 new council areas &mdash; some areas will not be represented.  Secondly, it is unclear how those representatives and the makeup of that  representation will be chosen. On the other hand, it is worth stressing that  the complexity of education and the background of the different sectors that  will be brought together in ESA should place greater emphasis on the range of  professional expertise that we have in the system; it should ensure that all  perspectives are properly catered for and that no aspect is left out. We do not  need so much emphasis on local representation as perhaps there was in the  absence of a regional Assembly. Things have moved on.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A point was made about the Libraries Bill. With the benefit  of hindsight, I think that we might have made a mistake by focusing so much on  one particular issue. My party called for the issue of the transferors to be  addressed, and we are glad to see that that has been done. It was not an issue  for one side of the House only. We take the issue of equity very seriously.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although I look forward to our system becoming more secular  over time, if one constituency is represented spiritually, we need to ensure  that there is a proper balance across the board. That has been achieved in the  system.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My other point is in reference to the two different Bills,  which is an area about which I have some reservations. It is difficult to take  a fully rounded perspective on this piece of legislation without being able to  make a judgement on the second piece of legislation. I appreciate that some  efforts were made to try to streamline the process.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The second piece of legislation will be critical; it is  important that the long title of that Bill will be flexible enough to ensure  that any gaps that arise between the two Bills can be addressed at the Second  Stage. If we see the other Bill only as this Bill reaches Final Stage, there  will not be any appetite to go backwards to try to undo some of the matters  that have already been discussed during the Committee Stage. It is important  that the second piece of legislation is sufficiently flexible to address  concerns.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I particularly look forward to proposals that will place  area planning and sustainable schools on a much firmer statutory footing,  because those are critical to the future vision of education. Alongside the  creation of the education and skills authority, it is important that that type  of approach is used so that we have a proper rounded approach to what is a very  progressive way forward. It will assist the public purse and &mdash; more importantly  &mdash; it will provide a better solution for the children of Northern Ireland.  I support the Second Stage of the Bill.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: As Question Time commences at 2.30 pm, I suggest that the House  takes its ease until that time. This debate will continue after Question Time,  when the next Member to speak will be the Minister of Education, Ms Caitr&iacute;ona  Ruane.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. We understand that several ministerial  statements will be made at 4.00 pm. Will you advise what precedence takes  place? When will we be likely to rejoin this debate?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: This debate will continue after Question Time. The statements will  follow in due course.</p>

	      <p class="H3SectionHeading">office of the first minister and deputy first  minister</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: It is time for questions to the Office of the First Minister and  deputy First Minister. I remind Members that the Speaker advised Whips recently  that the practice of reading out supplementary questions should cease. I remind  Members, therefore, that supplementary questions should be concise and should  not be read out.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Policing and Justice Powers</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mr  Kennedy </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister to  outline the stages for the devolution of policing and justice powers; and which  of these stages have specified timeframes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name= AQO1476/09>(AQO  1476/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mr McKay </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister for an  update on the proposed transfer of policing and justice powers. <a name= AQO607/09>(AQO 1607/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister (Mr M McGuinness)</strong>: With your permission, a LeasCheann Comhairle, I  will answer questions one and five together. Following discussions, the First  Minister and I have reached agreement on a number of arrangements relating to  how the devolution of policing and justice functions will be legislated for  until May 2012.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On 18 November 2008, the First Minister and I attended a meeting  of the Assembly and Executive Review Committee to offer advice on those agreed  arrangements in the context of the Committee&rsquo;s work on the devolution of  policing and justice. Our letter to the Chairperson of the Committee, which set  out those arrangements, and a paper on an agreed process in relation to the  devolution of policing and justice, were made public also.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Since that time, we have held preliminary discussions with  the Secretary of State on the funding allocation for a new Department of  justice, and we have briefed the Executive on developments to date. The  agreements that were reached include a series of 36 steps to bring about the  transfer of policing and justice powers. That process should proceed without  undue delay. We are determined to work faithfully through those steps in order  to build the necessary community confidence, and we will consult throughout the  process.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly and Executive Review Committee is preparing a  report on the modalities of devolution, which were informed by the agreements  that we have reached. When the modalities are agreed by the Assembly, the way  will be open for the preparation of the necessary consequential legislation  that will be enacted at Westminster  and by the Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are other practical and structural issues to be addressed,  and we look forward to further work from the Assembly and Executive Review  Committee on those.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Finance will be a key issue, and the First Minister and I  have held discussions already with the Secretary of State, which will lead  quickly to a process of engagement with relevant British Government  Departments.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It will be for the First Minister and me to table a motion  requesting the devolution of policing and justice powers, which, when passed &mdash;  and following the appropriate motion at Westminster &mdash; will give effect to the  transfer of functions, election of a justice Minister and the formal  appointment of an Attorney General.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that Members will appreciate the complexity of  the process that I have described. However, the First Minister and I want  devolution to happen without undue delay.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I am grateful to the deputy First Minister for his answer. Does he agree with  the sentiments that were expressed by the Prime Minister in the House of  Commons last week that the devolution of policing and justice to Northern Ireland  will occur in the next few months? I would be grateful for a yes or no answer.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: In my lengthy answer, I described the process that has been  agreed between us. Members will know that we are seeking to allow the Assembly  and Executive Review Committee to complete its work to agree the modalities,  and we have said that ad infinitum during the past number of weeks. We have  given a strong lead with regard to how we see the issue developing. Ultimately,  legislation will have to be enacted at Westminster  and at the Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is also the very important element of building  community confidence. The First Minister and I have said repeatedly that we are  determined to lead from the front on the issue.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I welcome the immense progress that  has been made on the issue. Will the deputy First Minister inform the House of  the time frame for the completion of the Assembly and Executive Review  Committee&rsquo;s report? Following the completion of the report, what will be the  next steps of the Committee and the Assembly?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: Following the Committee&rsquo;s earlier inquiry into the devolution of  policing and justice, which concluded in March 2008, and in response to our  joint letter of 20 July inviting it to undertake further work, the Committee  has been mandated by the Assembly to review progress on the implementation and  resolution of outstanding issues that were identified in the March report and to  consider any other matters that are related to the devolution of policing and  justice.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee has taken forward a work programme to address  those matters. The First Minister and I have offered the Committee advice to  inform its consideration of the issues, and we met the Committee and wrote to  the Chairperson on that basis on 18 November. I understand that the Committee  has agreed to finalise its first report before the Christmas recess.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  Does the deputy First Minister agree that the devolution of policing and  justice is a matter that must be taken cautiously?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: I agree that the approach that we have taken forward, in  conjunction with that of the Assembly and Executive Review Committee, tends to  suggest that we are being very thorough in how we deal with the issue. We are  conscious that the issue must be well handled. It is an important issue for the  people that we represent and, therefore, it does not allow us the luxury of  being slipshod. We will conduct the business of ensuring the transfer of powers  on policing and justice in an orderly fashion. The programme that we have  agreed will deliver that, and it will be delivered in conjunction with the  programme that I have outlined.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  also welcome the progress that has been made. Will the deputy First Minister  outline to the House in a little more detail the discussions that he and the  First Minister have had with the Treasury in relation to the funding of  devolution? Does he agree that it would be unreasonable to expect the people of  Northern Ireland  to pick up the tab for the cost of dealing with the past?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: The issue of funding is important. The devolution of policing and  justice powers should be accompanied with adequate resources to meet the  challenge of the new responsibilities and to deal with future pressures. The  First Minister and I have met the Secretary of State and discussed a process for  engaging on budget issues. We may also meet directly with key stakeholders in  the criminal justice field to discuss finance.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member has raised legitimate concerns. In dealing with  the British Government and the different Departments, we are conscious of our  responsibility to address what is seen by many in policing and justice as a considerable  shortfall. The Member has also identified added pressures, and all of those  matters will be discussed during the course of the next few weeks.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Questions 2 and 3 have been withdrawn.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Age Equality Issues</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Rev Dr  Robert Coulter </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and deputy First  Minister for its assessment of the key age equality issues and what policy  initiatives it has formulated to address these.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name= AQO1486/09>(AQO  1486/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: Under public service agreement (PSA) 7 in the Programme for  Government, we are committed to delivering a strong, independent voice for  older people. The recent appointment of Dame Joan Harbison as the Older  People&rsquo;s Advocate is an indication of how seriously we take that commitment. We  are aware of the wide range of issues that impact on older people, such as the  recent increases in the cost of living. The Executive are introducing a range  of measures in order to alleviate the burden on vulnerable groups, including  older people. These measures include action on benefit uptake, free public  transport and, as I have mentioned already, the appointment of the advocate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department for Work and Pensions announced recently  that its age strategy is to be reviewed and refreshed. In the near future, we  also intend to review our older people&rsquo;s strategy &lsquo;Ageing in an Inclusive  Society&rsquo; to identify areas where it might be improved and strengthened. We  will, of course, take the views of key stakeholders and the departmental  Committee as part of that process. We also continue to keep equality  legislation under review and monitor developments on age and other legislation  in Europe and elsewhere.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Robert  Coulter</strong>: Will the deputy First Minister give an undertaking to introduce  age-proofing of all Government-sponsored legislation and administrative Orders  coming before the Assembly in order to protect the interests of older people?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: We will give great consideration to the Member&rsquo;s point. It is  important to recognise the incredible contribution that older people make to  society. It has been interesting to note over the past months &mdash; year, even &mdash;  that the rights of older people have come to the fore in all sorts of  discussions all over the world. We have a duty and a responsibility to ensure  that we put in place processes that protect the rights of our older citizens,  who have, in effect, built the society in which we live today.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Given the interest in equality, when might we expect the single equality  legislation to be introduced? The deputy First Minister has already mentioned  the need to tackle fuel poverty, so will Minister Ritchie&rsquo;s paper on fuel  poverty now be approved by the Executive?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: The single equality legislation will be introduced as quickly as  possible. The warm homes scheme is Government&rsquo;s primary tool to tackle fuel  poverty. It offers a range of insulation and heating measures to eligible  householders. The scheme is oversubscribed and applications are being  prioritised. Applicants with no central heating, solid-fuel or Economy 7  heating will be treated as a priority. The Department for Social Development is  consulting on proposed changes to the scheme, and the consultation exercise  will run until 19 December. As the Member said, Minister Ritchie established a  fuel poverty task force in May 2008. She has prepared an Executive paper, which  the Executive will consider at the earliest opportunity.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Winter fuel payments are intended to help to combat fuel  poverty among older people, who are specifically targeted for help as they are  particularly vulnerable to the effects of cold weather and are more likely to  be on fixed incomes. For 2008-09, payments of &pound;250 will be made to people over  60 years of age, and those over 80 years of age will receive &pound;400.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question 5 has already been grouped with question 1.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">West Belfast and  Greater Shankill Task Forces Report 2002</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">6. <strong>Ms J  McCann </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister to  outline how the recommendations of the West Belfast  and Greater Shankill Task Forces Report 2002 compares with other anti-poverty  initiatives in the Department.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name= AQO1590/09> (AQO  1590/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: As an Executive, we are committed, under PSA 7, to drive a  programme across Government to reduce poverty and address inequality and  disadvantage wherever it exists. In addition, PSA 12 commits to delivering the  agreed overall objectives of the West Belfast  and Greater Shankill Task Forces within the Programme for Government period. We  recognise the parallel between some of the recommendations of the joint task  forces for west Belfast and the greater Shankill area and some of the work that  the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister (OFMDFM) is  progressing to tackle poverty and social inclusion, in so far as they relate to  improving employability and job creation. Both approaches recognise that the  best route out of poverty is to have a good job with a decent wage.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The policy on poverty and social inclusion that OFMDFM is  advancing covers a broad spectrum of need. That need will change at different  times in people&rsquo;s lives and will vary from one vulnerable group to another, and  also across different geographical areas. For that reason, the Executive  recently adopted Lifetime Opportunities as their overarching strategy for  tackling poverty and social exclusion. We remain committed to the full  implementation of the Programme for Government&rsquo;s PSAs and action plans,  including those related to tackling poverty and implementing the recommendations  of the West Belfast and Greater Shankill Task  Forces. Given the nature of poverty and disadvantage, many actions will  undoubtedly cross departmental boundaries, and it is my intention that my  Department will co-ordinate those cross-cutting actions through a ministerial  subcommittee of the Executive.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  The Minister has already gone some way towards answering my supplementary  question. Given the PSA commitment on the West Belfast  and Greater Shankill Task Forces Report 2002, are the Executive committed to  meeting their obligations in the Programme for Government?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: The inclusion of the task forces&rsquo; objectives in the Programme for  Government is a clear indication of the importance that Government attach to  the work.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">By including the objectives of the task force in the  Programme for Government, the normal apparatus for monitoring, reviewing and  reporting on PSA targets will apply. Like all aspects of the Programme for  Government, we are committed to meeting all the targets in our PSAs and work  plans. The overarching goals of the Programme for Government complement those  of the task force.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although the task forces are critical of the lack of  specific area initiatives, that does not mean that the needs of west Belfast and the greater  Shankill will be lost in the Programme for Government. It should be welcomed  when Departments can meet community needs through their mainstream activities,  which are ultimately more sustainable than short-term initiatives.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  Will the deputy First Minister agree that there was much more buy-in to the  task-force process in the west Belfast area than there was in the greater  Shankill area, and that the reasons for that differential provide lessons that  can be learned for future initiatives? Will he also agree that the task force  process has been somewhat overtaken by the emerging strategic regeneration  frameworks for west Belfast  and the greater Shankill?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: People will have their own views about the differential in the  buy-in to the task force process between west Belfast and the greater Shankill. As an MLA  who represents the area, the Member will be more aware than most as to whether  the level of interest towards the task force process in the greater Shankill  area was appropriate. There is a duty and responsibility on all of us to ensure  that every section of our community benefits from the work that will &mdash;  hopefully &mdash; flow from the task force and the implementation of our public  service agreements.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive are conscious of the need to ensure that the  work that we are involved in, and the programmes and processes that we  implement, make a difference to people on the ground. Without fear or favour to  any section of our community, if people are under pressure in any area, it is  our responsibility to do all that we can to ensure that they benefit from the  work of Government. We are very determined to ensure that the people of the  greater Shankill and west Belfast  benefit from the work of Government and the Executive.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  My question has already been answered, to some degree.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Mr Basil McCrea is not in his place for question 7.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Integrated Development Fund</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">8. <strong>Mr  McCartney </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister  to outline the achievements of the Integrated Development Fund in the  regeneration of (i) Derry/Londonderry; (ii) North Belfast; and (iii) West  Belfast.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name= AQO1604/09> (AQO 1604/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: The integrated development fund (IDF) has been successful in  promoting social and economic regeneration in both the north-west and the west Belfast/greater Shankill  areas through the extensive range of projects that it has supported. To date,  eight north-west IDF projects have been formally approved, and &pound;11&middot;2 million  from the IDF has been made available. The total cost of those projects is &pound;40&middot;1  million. Those projects include the development of a world-class research  centre of excellence at the Magee campus of the University of Ulster, which will  cost &pound;6 million, and the construction and development of the Skeoge Enterprise  Park, which will cost &pound;1&middot;1 million.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In west Belfast/greater  Shankill, 15 projects have been formally approved, with &pound;17&middot;7 million made  available from the IDF towards the total cost of &pound;51&middot;1 million. The funding  that has been made available includes &pound;1&middot;5 million towards the Suffolk social economy project to provide  retail units and commercial office space. Funding of &pound;4 million has also been  made available for the arterial routes improvement project to help regenerate  key arterial routes into the city centre. A further &pound;7 million was made  available for the task force education initiative to support delivery of a key  work programme that focuses on educational achievement and employability.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am happy to provide the Member with more details of  projects on request. Although north Belfast was  not one of the pilot areas selected, some of the west Belfast/greater  Shankill projects have impacted on the North Belfast  constituency area. For example, as the workforce and economic development  centre, which received &pound;1&middot;2 million from the IDF, provides outreach programmes  to ensure that training opportunities are widely known in both the west  Belfast/greater Shankill and north Belfast areas.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The arterial routes project, which receives &pound;4 million from  the fund, is designed to undertake an environmental improvement scheme in  several arterial routes, including the Crumlin Road and the upper Shankill. In  addition, the task force education initiative benefited areas of north Belfast. That remains an  Executive priority, and they have made additional funding available to agencies  there that are helping to improve the social and economic situation for the  local community.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as a  fhreagra. I thank the Minister for his answer and for his offer to send me  further information. Will any of the current projects be affected by the  closure of the IDF?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: All the approved IDF projects will be entitled to funding over  timescales agreed by Ministers. The projects that remain to be submitted for  approval will, subject to the provision and approval of the required economic  appraisals, be considered for funding support on their merits.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>: I  thank the deputy First Minister for his answer and for comprehensively showing  the good work of many projects that are supported by the integrated development  fund, including the centre of excellence in intelligent systems at Magee campus  in Derry, significant public-realm schemes,  the walled city signature tourism &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. It is Question Time, Mr Durkan.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  Will the Minister assure us that those approved projects will not be affected  by the closure? Will he also explain how the ending of the integrated  development fund is justified when it has enabled funding to projects across  sectors and Departments that would otherwise not have gained it?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: The work of further supporting the IDF projects will continue and  further submissions that have been made will be considered on their merits. We  must recognise that there is a huge job of work to be done and there are  outstanding projects that have to be tackled. We believe that the Executive can  tackle them comprehensively.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I do not believe that any area will suffer unduly because  of the ending of the IDF. However, it places additional responsibility and  burden on all Departments and on the Executive to ensure that good viable projects  that help in the regeneration of communities throughout the North will be  supported. Of course, that is all subject to available funding.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Executive Backlog</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">9. <strong>Mrs Long </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister when it is  expected that the Executive will have cleared the backlog of papers that arose  from the failure of the Executive to meet for five months. <a name= AQO1574/09>(AQO 1574/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: The First Minister and I made a commitment that additional  meetings of the Executive will take place over and above their regular schedule  to ensure that all outstanding business is dealt with as soon as possible. We  will therefore have held at least two scheduled meetings, two additional  meetings and a meeting of an Executive subgroup before Christmas. We made  excellent progress at our meetings of 20 November and 27 November on agreeing a  total of 28 papers that were awaiting Executive decision. We have also taken  forward the development of a strategy to support the local economy against the  effects of the global economic downturn.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Executive business is a continuous process of consultation  and agreement on draft papers submitted by Ministers. There will always be  Executive papers at various stages of consideration, but I am confident that we  are reaching the stage where each agreed draft paper will proceed routinely to  the next meeting of the Executive.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>:  When the Executive were in their period of non-operation, there was a  discussion that priority would be given to tackling issues of fuel poverty when  the Executive returned to normal business. What stage is that process at, and  when are we likely to hear announcements from the Executive?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: During that difficult and unacceptable period Ministers continued  with their work. The economic downturn, the credit crunch, and the fuel poverty  to which citizens are now being subjected are the subject of ongoing  deliberations and discussions at the Executive.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive are treating those matters as a top priority.  When the Assembly adjourns today, the Executive will meet around teatime in  order to continue the work that we have been engaged in, and we will meet again  next Thursday. At the end of that process, we hope to be able to announce a  package that will make a difference.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burnside</strong>:  During the five months in which no official meetings of the Executive took  place, how many meetings did the deputy First Minister have with the First  Minister in order to discuss the transfer of policing and justice powers to the  Assembly and the Executive? When did those meetings conclude with a sign from  10 Downing Street that policing and justice powers were to be transferred  within a couple of months? Will the deputy First Minister outline the sequence  of meetings and events between him and the First Minister and 10 Downing Street  that culminated in that decision?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: In those five months, the First Minister and I met regularly. I  cannot give the Member a figure off the top of my head, but we discussed many  issues, not only the transfer of policing and justice powers. We did our job in  our joint office &mdash; the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister.  Regardless of how difficult the issues were that we had to deal with, neither  of us ran into a corner and huffed. We did not get into a situation in which we  did not speak to each other.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I know that a situation arose during the first  Administration in which the First Minister and the deputy First Minister were  not speaking to each other. That has never happened to us, because we have shown  ourselves to be mature politicians. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span> I  will not identify any Member who has just laughed. We have shown ourselves to  be mature politicians who recognised that solutions had to be found to the  difficult issues that we faced. We did that; we met regularly and consistently,  and we finally found a way forward.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There will be other challenges, on other issues, in the  time ahead. Our job, as leaders in the Assembly, in the Executive and in the  country is to be solution-seekers to problems. That is the mode in which the  First Minister and I will find ourselves. We should be happy that we have found  a way forward, and we should now ensure that the transfer of policing and  justice powers will happen in line with the programme that is laid before us.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  I thank the deputy First Minister for his answer. Will he tell the House what  other items of business, having cleared all the earlier preparatory processes,  have yet to be decided on by OFMDFM for the Executive&rsquo;s consideration?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: The work of the Executive continues. There will always be issues  to resolve during the lifetime of this Executive and this Assembly; there is an  almost never-ending list. When we leave the House today, Ministers will meet to  deal with issues that are relevant to the people whom we represent. For  example, the Assembly has discussed the economic downturn, the credit crunch  and fuel poverty, having recognised that we must deal with those issues in the  context of a global economic storm. There is a range of issues to discuss. If I  were to go into the detail of every single one, I would be here for another 30  minutes. I will write to the Member and give him the details of those issues if  he so wishes.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Children&rsquo;s Champions</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">10. <strong>Mr  O&rsquo;Loan </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister to  outline the roles of the junior Ministers as &ldquo;Children&rsquo;s Champions&rdquo; and how  they have carried out this role.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name= AQO1521/09> (AQO  1521/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: The junior Ministers have responsibility for the co-ordination of  policy that has an impact on the lives of children and young people. Their role  is to ensure that those issues remain high on the Government&rsquo;s agenda. To  achieve that aim, the junior Ministers jointly chair the ministerial  subcommittee on children and young people, which the Executive established.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The subcommittee has identified and is progressing six key  priority areas for action and has agreed that hearing the voice of young people  will underpin its work and that of the subgroups. The junior Ministers are also  driving forward with the implementation of the 10-year strategy for children  and young people. They chair a strategy planning and review group, which  includes key statutory, voluntary and community sector representatives and is  advising them on a three-year draft strategy action plan.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The junior Ministers have a 12-month work plan, integral to  which is continued engagement with young people and children. As part of that,  recently, the junior Ministers and the Speaker jointly hosted a youth debate in  the Assembly Chamber. The topic for the debate focused on the causes and  effects of young people being drawn into antisocial behaviour, including  underage drinking and drug-taking. It was attended by approximately 140 young  people, and the junior Ministers have undertaken to relay the points that were raised  back to the ministerial subcommittee. The junior Ministers continue to examine,  and have taken into account, other ways of engaging with children and young  people to ensure that they have the opportunity to put forward their views on  the key issues affecting their lives.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind the Members who were not in their places at 2.30 pm that  the Speaker has recently spoken to Whips and has asked that the practice of  reading supplementary questions cease. Therefore, I ask that Members put forward  concise supplementary questions.</p>

	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Mrs O&rsquo;Neill is not her place for question 1.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Efficiency Savings</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Dr Farry </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety for an  update on the delivery of efficiency savings under his Department&rsquo;s current  budget.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name= AQO1582/09> (AQO 1582/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: My Department is  monitoring the achievement of efficiencies on a quarterly basis. Against a target  of &pound;118 million for 2008-09, the assessment of savings achieved as at 30  September is &pound;48 million. I anticipate delivery of the full &pound;118 million for  2008-09, and I am working closely with trusts on their proposals for years two  and three.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his answer. I know that he has a flawed budget with  which to work. However, no doubt he is aware of the major concern across the  community about efficiency savings. Therefore, what steps is the Minister  taking to police how the trusts deliver efficiency savings to ensure that what  we have is changes to policies and practices, rather than simple cuts?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The Department monitors savings  quarterly. That is an exercise that we undertake. As I said, I am determined  that those savings will not be cuts, but efficiencies. The efficiencies are not  a target that I set; rather, all the parties in the Executive agreed to them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Regarding the concern that the Member raised, the trusts  have undertaken a series of consultations about their proposals. I encourage Dr  Farry, and anyone else, to come forward with their concerns. Nothing is settled  as yet. By early in the new year, the results of those consultations will be  given to me. If there is consensus, I do not have a decision to make. If there  is not consensus, I have a decision to make. I am keen to hear the views of  others on the matter, and I am particularly keen to hear from Members who do  not think that this is a good idea. They must tell me what their good idea is  and how that will be evaluated against financial efficiencies.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Does the Minister agree that there has been a certain amount of scaremongering  about 700 nurses being sacked and that that story is totally false and  ridiculous? Does he also agree that some Members of the DUP have been  opportunistic in the way in which they have portrayed that story, especially as  it was them who demanded efficiency savings and voted against increases in the  budget that the Minister secured last year?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The proposals are for a  reduction of just over 700 nursing posts. It should be borne in mind that that  is over a three-year period and that over the same period, there will be  natural wastage from more than 2,000 nurses either retiring or moving job.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, such a proposal will easily be accommodated, and  I am confident that compulsory redundancies can be avoided. Those issues are  out for consultation, and if anyone has better ideas, I am listening, as long  as those are serious ideas that show me where the savings will come from,  rather than opportunistic proposals.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with the Member. When Peter  Robinson was Finance Minister, he talked about efficiencies; now Members from  his party talk about cuts. Given the performance of some DUP Members during  last week&rsquo;s debate on the proposal for a public health agency, and the fact  that the same Mr Robinson was happy to agree at the Executive to the establishment  of a public health agency, it seems that one or two members of the DUP have  gone more than a little astray from their party leader&rsquo;s position.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  Does the Minister believe that reducing total nursing numbers, removing  maternity beds and reducing psychiatric intensive care unit beds at Altnagelvin Hospital are acceptable efficiency  savings? How do those and the other cuts and closures that are being proposed  square with the promises that were made at the time of the Programme for  Government, which, we were told, was as good as it gets?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Those specific proposals have  been made as part of a consultation process and given that the Member has  strong views on the matter, I encourage him to contribute to the consultation.  I remind him that the Bamford proposals include a 10% reduction in  mental-health admissions. Consequently, the number of beds will be reduced.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The proposals on the numbers of nursing posts are concerned  with the way in which services are delivered, with alternative delivery and  with having less reliance on acute services and more reliance on services in  the community. Patients tell us that they want domiciliary-based care,  particularly with wrap-around care packages, and they do better from such care.  Elderly people in particular want to avoid residential homes and nursing homes  for as long as possible, and they want to be maintained in their own homes. All  the proposals have a consequence for staffing, and staff may move from one area  of provision to another.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The proposals are out for consultation, and I will listen  hard to anyone who has better ideas and better ways of providing savings. I  made a deal that every penny of the &pound;700 million of health efficiency savings  would go back into health. Those moneys are already earmarked and are being  spent on the delivery of new services, and I do not want to have to cut the new  services in order to fund the efficiencies.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Mental-Health Facility: Craigavon Area   Hospital</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Mr W  Clarke </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety for  his assessment of the ability of the new mental-health facility on the Craigavon Area Hospital  site to cater for the projected number of people with mental-health problems in  the Southern Health and Social Care Trust area.&nbsp; <a name= AQO1622/09>(AQO  1622/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Major investment in community  infrastructure is planned to support the new Bluestone unit at Craigavon Area Hospital,  which is to consist of 74 beds, in order to ensure that the facility can cater  for the projected number of people with mental-health problems. That will  include the opening, in February 2009, of two resource centres in Craigavon and  Dungannon. Together with an existing day hospital in Newry, those will offer 56  places a day, which will prevent inappropriate admissions to hospital and  facilitate early discharge from hospital.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Enhancement of the existing home-treatment team is planned  to include patients with functional mental illness who are over 65 and are  treated at home. Over the next three years, the trust is also investing in  primary mental-healthcare services, which will substantially reduce demand for  inpatient beds at the Bluestone unit. Services will still be based at St Luke&rsquo;s  Hospital. Those developments are in line with the Bamford vision, which  advocates that community care is preferable to inpatient treatment.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  answer. What level of provision for mental health will be available at the new Downe Hospital?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I would have needed warning of  the question in order to provide precise details of the facilities for  mental-health services in the new Downe   Hospital. It is a new,  enhanced local hospital, but, because of the tradition of mental-health  provision in Downpatrick, there will be in-patient provision there. I cannot  give the Member the number of beds, although it is on record; however, I cannot  carry all those numbers in my head. If the Member is keen, I will write to him  about that.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  I am sure that the House will be reassured by what the Minister has said today;  in particular about the provision of 74 beds at Craigavon Area   Hospital. Does the  Minister agree with me that, regrettably, a stigma is attached to mental ill  health? It should not be so, but, unfortunately, it is. Will the Minister  detail for the House what steps he will take to break that stigma down?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Health,  Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Lord Morrow makes an important point about  stigma being attached to mental ill health. Mental-health needs in Northern Ireland are commensurably much higher  than in the rest of the United    Kingdom. One of the paradoxes that I have  inherited is that, historically, our expenditure on mental health is much lower  than in the rest of the United    Kingdom.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Our vision for the future is based on the Bamford Review  and its recommendations. It involves sending out key messages aimed at the  prevention of mental ill health and it includes new mental-health and  incapacity legislation; a shift from hospital-based to community-based  services; the development of specialist services for children and young people;  and the provision of an adequately trained workforce. Those are some of the  messages in the Bamford Review, and we are implementing them to address mental  ill health, learning disability and dementia.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those provisions will help to address the stigma attached  to mental ill health. One of our biggest problems is the denial of  mental-health problems. Mental ill health is as important as physical ill  health. If one is physically unwell, one will go to a doctor; people must be  prepared to do the same when they are mentally unwell.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his responses and acknowledge the excellence of the  facility at Craigavon. Does he agree with me that, as part of the Bamford  vision, there is a need for more supported accommodation for patients who may  never be able to live independently?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I agree fully. We are examining  the provision of residential homes, nursing homes and specialist homes, but  there is also a need for supported-living facilities. That is a crucial factor  that will allow us to re-settle those with learning disabilities who have had a  hospital address for a long period in a community setting. It affects other  areas as well.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Mid-Ulster   Hospital: Acute Services</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mr I  McCrea </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety what  action he is taking to ensure that acute services are retained at the Mid-Ulster Hospital.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name= AQO1478/09> (AQO 1478/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The Mid-Ulster Hospital  will be developed as a local hospital as set out in &lsquo;Developing Better  Services: Modernising Hospitals and Reforming Structures&rsquo;. Acute services for  the people of the Northern Health and Social Services Board area will be  provided largely at the Antrim Area and Causeway Hospitals.  That remains my position. However, I am committed to the provision of safe,  high-quality services for all the people of Northern   Ireland, and changes to the services provided at the Mid-Ulster Hospital should be made only when  robust, alternative arrangements are in place at other hospitals.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  I am disappointed that the Minister has already made up his mind on the  downgrading of services at the Mid-Ulster   Hospital. Our  neighbouring hospital, the South Tyrone, has no acute services &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:  Order. This is Question Time, Mr McCrea. Please ask a question.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  If the Minister has not taken a final decision, will he commit to retaining  acute services at the Mid-Ulster   Hospital?</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Mr McCrea should acquaint  himself with the document &lsquo;Developing Better Services&rsquo; because it is one of the  overarching strategies that the Department has been following for a number of  years. The strategy does not simply suggest the downgrading of services, but,  instead, suggests the changing of services. Substantial investment will go into  the Mid-Ulster Hospital, and I will be able to talk  about that in due course.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, as far as acute services are concerned, because  they are so specialised, and due to the attendant risks involved, they must be  provided in an acute hospital setting. There are nine acute hospitals in Northern Ireland, two of which are in the  Northern Board area &mdash; the Causeway Hospital and the Antrim Area   Hospital. Those hospitals  will provide acute services for Mid Ulster, meaning that the vast majority of  those living in that area will be within 45 minutes of an acute hospital and  all residents will be within one hour&rsquo;s journey. As far as the Mid-Ulster Hospital is concerned, there will be  consultation, but as far as Mr McCrea and everyone else are concerned, the  direction in which the Department is heading in relation to hospital services  is clear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his answer. However, I remind him that the Ulster  Unionist Party had a policy of rebuilding hospital services, and gave a  commitment to the Mid-Ulster   Hospital. Where does that  commitment sit now?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I question whether the residents of towns such as Pomeroy  are within 45 minutes of Antrim   Area Hospital.  Given the failure of that hospital to provide safe services, is the Minister  sure that he is providing quality of service to the people of Mid Ulster?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: That last remark about Antrim Area   Hospital not providing  safe services demonstrates a lack of perception on Mr Molloy&rsquo;s behalf. It is a  disgraceful remark for him to make and it is disgraceful that he is  scaremongering in that manner.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We cannot have acute hospitals in every town and village in  Northern Ireland.  We have nine acute hospitals in addition to the Mater  Hospital in Belfast, which also provides acute services.  That is well beyond the recommended provision for the size of our population.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, the Member is aware that I have received  demand after demand to make the Health Service efficient; that is what I am  doing, and in doing so, tough choices have to be made. There is an important future  for the Mid-Ulster   Hospital, but it will not  be in delivering acute services. It will deliver services in areas such as  day-case surgery; diagnostics; care for the elderly; inpatient care;  rehabilitation and assessment; and palliative care for inpatients. The hospital  will also be collocated with a health and care centre, which is a major investment  that will provide &mdash; for example &mdash; a nurse-led minor injuries unit. That will  represent an important service provision for the people of that area.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, in relation to acute services, Antrim Area   Hospital is the closest  hospital. I say to Mr Molloy that it is safer to provide acute services in a  hospital such as Antrim Area Hospital  than it is in a small hospital such as the Mid-Ulster Hospital.  Although the staff in the Mid-Ulster   Hospital are very  professional and dedicated, it would be better to make the full service  available in a larger hospital given the throughput.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Will the Minister assure the House  that the level of acute-service provision at the Mid-Ulster Hospital  will be retained until a viable alternative is available elsewhere?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I remind Mr McGlone of my  previous answer, when I said that changes to the services provided at the  Mid-Ulster Hospital should only be made when robust alternative arrangements  are in place at other hospitals.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">CSR: Impact on Western Health and Social Care Trust  Area</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mr  Gallagher </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  for his assessment of the impact of the Comprehensive Spending Review on  services in the Western Health and Social Care Trust Area.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name= AQO1543/09> (AQO 1543/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The comprehensive spending  review (CSR) will secure real improvements in services for patients and clients  across the Western Health and Social Care Trust, in addition to other major  regional initiatives. Those improvements include the roll-out of the human  papillomavirus vaccination; remote monitoring for people with long-term  conditions; enhanced child protection arrangements; and improved ambulance  response times.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">By 2010-11, the Western Trust will benefit from an  additional &pound;9 million each year for mental-health learning disability and  long-term conditions; &pound;3&middot;3 million for children services; &pound;6 million to address  demographic pressures; and &pound;4&middot;8 million for new drug therapies. Other provision  will include &pound;3 million for acute renal, cardio-vascular and stroke services;  &pound;4&middot;3 million for elective-care access; &pound;1&middot;2 million for disability services;  and &pound;4&middot;4 million for service improvements and quality and safety.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As well as benefiting from &pound;17 million of capital  investment in ambulance services, I am committed to providing the Western  Health and Social Care Trust with substantial capital investment over the next  three years.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  I acknowledge the Minister&rsquo;s comments and his work in capital investment,  particularly at the Omagh and Enniskillen hospitals. Does the Minister accept  that, as a result of the comprehensive spending review, severe cuts have been  made across all trusts, but that those cuts are having an extremely severe  impact on the Western Health and Social Care Trust because that is the only  trust that inherited a legacy of debt? Furthermore, will the Minister outline  any steps that he can take, in his Department or in the Executive, to remove  that millstone of debt from the shoulders of the people in the Western Health  and Social Care Trust?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I am not aware of a deficit of  the order of which Tommy Gallagher appears to be aware. The annual operating  budget of the Western Health and Social Care Trust rises every year throughout  the CSR period. The spending power uplift totals will cumulatively be 20&middot;8% at  the end of the three years. Therefore, the Western Health and Social Care Trust  is, in fact, not going backwards &mdash; there are not cuts; the spending power is  rising.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Certainly, changes have been proposed as part of the  efficiency requirement of 3% per annum over three years. I have to find some  &pound;700 million in efficiency savings over the next three years. I would rather  not have to do that &mdash; it is much nicer to have a quiet life &mdash; but I do not hold  the purse strings. I am not in charge of finance; that is the DUP together with  Sinn F&eacute;in, who actually operate this Government. They make the decisions on  where the money goes, and this is where I am.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The health budget is down by &pound;300 million this year, and by  the end of the three-year period, our deficit will be about &pound;600 million in  spending power in comparison with the average in England. If Members such as Mr Ian  McCrea want money spent and services maintained in Mid Ulster or anywhere else,  it is not me to whom they need to talk: it is the Finance Minister.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Given what the Minister just said  about services in the Western Health and Social Care Trust, if the responses to  the consultation on the proposed closure of Greenfield residential care home in Strabane  are that the home should remain open, will the Western Health and Social Care  Trust accept that, and keep the home open? Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: As far as any proposals and  consultations in any trust area are concerned, the trust will, of course, have  to listen to the proposals. However, those proposals will have to be based on  sound provision of health and social care services in that particular area.  They will also have to be able to demonstrate an alternative, because there is  no way out of this unless the Member can persuade the DUP to put their hands in  their pockets. The Member will, therefore, have to show me an alternative.  However, no hard and fast decisions have been made.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We are in a consultation process and listening to all the  feedback from that consultation, but each of those proposals has a financial  tag that has to be met. Otherwise, all the other provisions about which I  talked to Mr Gallagher &mdash; such as &pound;3&middot;3 million in children&rsquo;s services, &pound;4&middot;8  million for new drug therapies, &pound;4&middot;3 million for elective care access, money  for disability services, service developments, and so on &mdash; will have to be cut.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Deeny</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his commitment to financial investment in the Western  Health and Social Care Trust. Does that investment include the proposed  midwifery-led maternity unit for Omagh on which we were promised that the  Minister would make a decision at the start of the year?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In Downpatrick, similar proposals got a positive response,  which was good for the mothers of east Down. What now for the mothers of  Tyrone?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I welcome Dr Deeny back to  Question Time. There has been a consultation on the proposal for a midwifery  unit in Omagh. The recommendations are with me, and I am deliberating on them.  Other issues around Omagh hospital have to be settled, and that is what I am  doing at the moment.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Respite Care: People with Learning Difficulties</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">6. <strong>Mrs Long </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety to report  on respite care for people with learning difficulties.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name= AQO1581/09> (AQO 1581/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Respite care can take various  forms to meet the needs of individuals with a learning disability, or the needs  of carers and families. It offers carers, and clients, independent time and the  opportunity for a change of environment and stimulus. Under the comprehensive  spending review, the total budget secured for children and adults with learning  disabilities in Northern Ireland was &pound;33 million &mdash; &pound;17 million recurrent &mdash; over  the next three years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That will benefit children and adults with disabilities,  and, among other things, will enable health and social care trusts to provide  an additional 200 new or enhanced respite care packages over the next three  years for people with learning disabilities and for their families and carers.  It is anticipated that by 31 March 2011, those additional packages will have  benefited 800 people.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his answer. Has any thought been given to the particular  needs of childlike adults, an increasing number of whom are seeking respite?  Currently, when those individuals reach adulthood, they are included in adult  respite units, which are not always best suited to their needs.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I assure Mrs Long that I am  actively considering that. One of the difficulties is assessing the need. As  she knows, need is assessed and then addressed. However, working out that need  is, frankly, extremely difficult and vexing.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For example, this year, we have invested in an extra 2,000  weeks of dementia respite care; it is not enough, and we are not clear how much  more is necessary. Similarly, there are an extra 200 respite care packages for  people with learning disabilities, which will benefit 800 people. However,  other types of respite have to be considered as well.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The picture is confused, and I have asked my Department&rsquo;s  statistics branch to focus on it. I have to establish what the need is, so that  it can be addressed. Respite care is one of the crucial areas that we provide  for, and there is a strategy in place: Caring for Carers. However, unless we  are providing adequate respite care, we are not truly caring for carers.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>: Is  there a strategy to deal with those people with learning disabilities who are  taken care of by their parents in the community, when their parents  unfortunately pass on?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: That is one of the vexing  questions that we have addressed through the Bamford vision for mental health,  learning disability and dementia. There are no easy answers and there is no  cheap solution. Carers care for their children all their lives, but, because  health and social care is becoming more efficient, we are reaching a point  where, thankfully, a number of those individuals are outliving their parents.  That means that they need to be taken care of.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That is one of the recurring themes arising in discussions  with carer groups. What will happen to those children when their parents pass  on? Who is going to look after them? Parents require reassurance, and that is what  I seek to give them.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  I am sure that the Minister will acknowledge that the other star turns on  Saturday were the carers who participated in the panel at our very successful  conference.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister ensure that respite care will be considered  fully by the joint review that is being undertaken by him and the Department  for Social Development (DSD)?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: An important piece of work that  I have undertaken with DSD, as Mr McNarry said, is to look into areas such as  benefits. The Department also considers areas such as flexible, short-term  respite provision; day activities; residential respite care; and domiciliary  support. Those areas must be addressed in order to provide comfort to carers  who have, as Mr Craig said, real concerns about the future.</p>

	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">7. <strong>Mr Ford </strong>asked  the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety for an update on his  Department&rsquo;s attempts to combat hospital acquired infections.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name= AQO1584/09>(AQO 1584/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: On 14 October, I advised the  Assembly that I had accepted all the recommendations contained in the reports  of the Regulation and Quality Improvement Authority (RQIA) review of the  outbreak of clostridium difficile in the Northern Health and Social Care Trust  hospitals. The Department&rsquo;s service delivery unit and the its cleaner hospitals  team have now met with all trusts and their healthcare-associated infection  lead staff, and they have dedicated bespoke support for each trust. The cleaner  hospitals team is now on the ground and work is in hand on developing  trust-specific action plans, and on ensuring that the RQIA recommendations are  being implemented and monitored.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department has taken forward several initiatives  centrally, including the regional hand-hygiene campaign that I launched in  June, the hand-hygiene &ldquo;five moments&rdquo; card for healthcare workers that was  issued in October, and the regional infection and prevention control manual,  which is now online. In the next few weeks, I will launch a patient information  leaflet on clostridium difficile.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, primary antimicrobial prescribing guidelines  were published in November, and all five trusts have now appointed  antimicrobial pharmacists to work on antibiotic use and antimicrobial  resistance.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Before moving to questions to the Minister for Social Development,  I remind Members that, after speaking to party Whips, the Speaker has ruled  that the practice of reading supplementary questions must cease. Therefore,  Members must keep their supplementary questions concise.</p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="6"></a>Social Development</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Protocols</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mr A  Maskey </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development what protocols she follows  in responding to representations from, or questions raised, by Assembly  Members.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name= AQO1482/09> (AQO 1482/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development (Ms Ritchie)</strong>: Ministers, including me, apply a  straightforward principle to representations, questions, suggestions and other  matters raised by Members. I take such represen&shy;tations seriously, consider  them fully, and respond as quickly as the subject matter allows.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I make every effort to meet specific targets for response  times when they apply, such as is the case with Assembly questions. I assure Mr  Maskey that I approach his representations on behalf of his constituents in  precisely the same objective manner as I approach those from other Members.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members must appreciate that that does not mean that they  will agree with, or be happy about, every position that I take, every response  that they receive, or every decision that I make. However, that is the nature  of Government and of democracy.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. My question was not related to  whether or not the Minister would agree with me. I understand and fully  acknowledge that the Minister will not always agree, or wish to agree, with points  or representations that are made by Members. Those are matters that must be  considered on merit.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. It is Question Time, Mr Maskey. Please ask a question.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  I appreciate that, Mr Deputy Speaker. I wanted to get to the heart of this  matter with the Minister. For example, I never received a response from the  Minister to a question that I asked during a recent Adjournment debate.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. It is Question Time, Mr Maskey; I must hear a question.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. When should I have expected to receive a response  from the Minister in respect of the Adjournment debate that I secured, and  which the Minister commented on at that time? I never received a response from  the Minister. I received a telephone call from a member of the local Housing  Executive management team some weeks later. I had no communication on that  matter from the Minister until I met her last week.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: Methinks Mr Maskey protests too much. I will set the  record straight: Mr Maskey has asked 29 Assembly Questions of me since May  2007, and I am currently answering the twenty-ninth of those.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">He has written to me on seven occasions to raise matters of  concern, and I have responded to each letter. Two of those letters requested  meetings with me. As a result, Mr Maskey and I met on both occasions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The most recent of those meetings took place on 24 November  2008, when he and I had dialogue on environmental improvements in the Markets.  In fact, subsequent to that meeting, Mr Maskey tabled certain Assembly  questions, which I have already covered, that dealt with the detail of that  particular meeting and the reasons for various steps that I have taken, with  special reference to environmental improvements.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, I think that my answer explains clearly that I  have dealt with all the issues that Mr Maskey raised with me.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Does the Minister agree that all Members must respect parliamentary protocol  and language? Does she also agree that some people&rsquo;s oversensitivity on those  matters makes the Assembly look as though it lives in fantasy and make-believe?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: Mr McCallister knows me well, so I assure him that I  seek to respond fairly and courteously to Members&rsquo; questions and to the issues  that they raise.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Does the Minister recall her visit  to Ardcarne Park in Newry, where she met me and  local residents in the home of a community leader in the area? Does she agree  that that was a productive meeting and an excellent example of how to bring  democracy literally into the front rooms of local people?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Can the Minister tell the House how frequently she meets  constituency MLAs, and can she describe the quality of those interactions?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I recall well that visit to Ardcarne Park,  which was at Mr Bradley&rsquo;s request. I also recall well local residents&rsquo; concerns  about the housing programme and the courteous way in which I was met. I was  happy to assist them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">To get to the meat of Mr Bradley&rsquo;s question, I have considerable  interaction with Members in their capacity as constituency MLAs. I believe that  an important benefit of devolution and a sign of the strength of local  democracy is Members&rsquo; ability to have quality access to Ministers in order that  their constituents&rsquo; interests can be represented. My record shows that whenever  Members request meetings with me to discuss constituency issues, I am open to  engagement and I am predisposed to agree to a meeting unless there is a clear  reason why such a meeting would be inappropriate or unproductive.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have met Members in their capacity as constituency MLAs  in the House, in my Department&rsquo;s headquarters, on site visits, and at many  events. My experience of engagement with Members, whether in formal meetings or  informally on the margins of meetings that occur in the Building or on site  visits has, I must say, been overwhelmingly positive.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Illegal Gambling</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr I  McCrea </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development what steps she is taking  to tackle illegal gambling.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name= AQO1481/09> (AQO  1481/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I am aware that the Member has an active interest in  tackling illegal gambling and has tabled previous Assembly questions for  written answer on the matter.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Gambling activity in Northern   Ireland is regulated by the Betting, Gaming, Lotteries  and Amusements (Northern    Ireland) Order 1985. Enforcement of the law,  including the detection and prosecution of persons who have been engaged in  illegal gambling, is the Police Service&rsquo;s responsibility. My Department is  responsible for the development of policy and for the promotion of law on  gambling other than the National Lottery. Enforcement of the law on gambling,  including the operational priority that the police attach to it and the  resources that are allocated, are matters for the Chief Constable and his  senior commanders.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I note with concern that enforcement of gambling law is not  shown as a priority for the Police Service in its annual policing plan, which  has been approved by the Policing Board.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, the Police Service has assured the Department for  Social Development that it will respond to any legitimate complaint that it  receives in relation to alleged illegal gambling, whether that report comes  from the general public or Members of the House.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her answer. Will she advise the House how many meetings  she has had with the Police Service to discuss illegal gambling? People have  lost their cars and their houses because of gambling. It is a major concern,  and I welcome the fact that the Minister views it as a priority.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for his question. Over the past  year, I have had several meetings with the Police Service of Northern Ireland  on a wide range of issues. Some of those meetings concerned gambling. I hope to  talk to the Police Service in the not-too-distant future about a range of  issues. I will raise the Member&rsquo;s particular concerns, of which I am well aware  from his correspondence and his questions for oral and written answer.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Impact of the Credit Crunch on the Housing Market and  the Construction Industry</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Dr  McDonnell </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development for her assessment of  the impact of the credit crunch on the housing market.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name= AQO1525/09> (AQO 1525/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">9. <strong>Mr W  Clarke </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development what measures her  Department has taken to reduce the impact of the credit crunch on the  construction industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name= AQO1614/09> (AQO  1614/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">20. <strong>Mr  Brolly </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development what action she is taking  to respond to the difficulties being faced by the construction industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name= AQO1620/09> (AQO 1620/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: With your permission, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will answer  questions 3, 9 and 20 together, because of their similarity.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There has been considerable discussion of what the  Executive can do about the credit crunch. If we are being honest, the truth is  &ldquo;not much&rdquo;. The credit crunch is the result of global economic forces over  which we have little control. However, the Executive can do things that will  help to counter the effects of the credit crunch and its attendant economic recession.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There can be no doubt that the economic downturn is  beginning to bite in Northern    Ireland. The evidence of a slowdown &mdash;  bordering on a collapse &mdash; of the private housing sector is quite stark. For  example, the total number of new-dwelling starts has reduced by almost 40% in  the past year. A house-building employment survey of 202 house builders found  that 3,000 jobs were lost from those companies alone in the 12 months to June  2008. A further 1,500 jobs are forecast to be lost soon if market conditions do  not improve. The credit crunch and recession are having a devastating effect on  the housing market. Therefore, it is vital that, as a minimum, we build the  5,250 new social houses that the Executive signed up for over the next three  years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members &mdash; particularly Willie Clarke and Francie Brolly,  who submitted the other two questions that I am answering in this group &mdash; will  be pleased to know that I have a proposal for an expanded social housing  newbuild programme before the Executive. I have made that proposal because I  believe that increased investment in social housing at this time can have a  profoundly beneficial effect on the economy in a relatively short time. The  economic benefits of increased investment in social housing can help the  construction industry on the one hand and meet housing need on the other. I  have circulated the paper to my Executive colleagues, and it outlines in detail  how I can deliver the programme. I await their consideration.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her answer. The Minister has given us a broad outline  of how a social housing programme might boost the economy. Will she give more  detail on the effect that a stronger social housing programme would have on  jobs, for example?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I submitted a paper to my Executive colleagues, which  outlines in detail just how beneficial an increase in the social housing  development programme could be at this time. My primary interest is to meet  housing need, but building more new homes to meet that need can directly help  many people in the construction industry. In turn, that will boost the local  economy during these very difficult times.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is not only me who thinks that increased investment in  social housing is the best short-term measure to boost our economy. The First  Trust quarterly economic review was published last week, and, therein,  Professor Mike Smyth of the University   of Ulster&rsquo;s school of  economics said:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;There is a strong case for revising the priorities  set out in the NI Executive January 2008 Budget. For instance if capital  expenditure could be redirected towards social housing, it would help to offset  the collapse in private sector housebuilding.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That was the first Budget change that he  highlighted.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for her  answer. As the Minister undoubtedly knows, large numbers of people in south  Down are registered homeless and are in housing stress, particularly in Newcastle, Castlewellan  and Downpatrick. People on the street are asking me when those houses will be  built &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. The Member must ask a question.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  I was getting to the question.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I know that the Member was getting to the question. However,  during Question Time, each Minister has only half an hour to take and answer  questions.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  The people on the street are asking when houses will be built &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Irrespective of what the people in the street are saying, I am  saying that the Member must ask a question.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  That was a question.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: In case Mr Clarke is under any misconception, I have  agreed, and I am determined, to deliver 5,250 new homes in the next three  years. As I have said repeatedly, that target is non-negotiable. Although the  construction industry is enduring challenging times, it has a tremendous  opportunity to work with me to deliver those new social homes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have met the people who are homeless and on waiting lists  in Downpatrick, Newcastle  and Castlewellan, and Mr Clarke will, perhaps, mention other areas in south  Down. Furthermore, many people come to my constituency office every week. I say  to Mr Clarke and to the people of south Down that I, as the Minister with  responsibility for housing, will not leave them untouched. I will ensure that  south Down receives its fair and adequate share of new houses. If Mr Clarke  wants to discuss a particular issue, he could, perhaps, raise that with me  directly in a letter, rather than through the pages of the &lsquo;Mourne Observer&rsquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brolly</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Is the Minister aware that the  amount of money allocated for the construction of social housing per unit is  insufficient to meet the new demands of energy saving and environmental issues?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: As the Member will be aware, from April 2008,  developers are obliged to ensure that all newly constructed homes adhere to the  code for sustainable homes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department and I are keen to ensure that best value for  money is secured. For that reason, I instructed the Housing Executive some  weeks ago to ensure that housing associations &mdash; who are the providers &mdash; have  the full supply of Housing Executive land and know the details and lists of  available land. That will enable those associations to build on Housing  Executive land, which will, I hope, be cheaper.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: In  light of the decreasing construction costs, will the Minister confirm that her  budget makes savings? Will she indicate how many more social houses will be  provided and how it will compare with existing targets?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: As Mr Cree will be aware, I am determined, and I have  agreed, to construct 5,250 houses in the next three years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If savings are made I hope that I will have permission to  use them in my Department. The reason that I put the paper to my Executive  colleagues was to show the value of a social housing development programme and  to demonstrate that, on the one hand, we can boost the economy and act as a  catalyst &mdash; not only for economic development but also for job creation &mdash; and  can kick-start the suppliers and others involved in social housing. The carpenters  supplying the wood, for example, the plumbers, and all those involved in the  sector can be brought back into work. It also provides the valuable asset of  houses to meet housing need. I want to meet the Member&rsquo;s objective, which I  hope is shared by everybody in the House, particularly by my Executive  colleagues.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>:  Will the Minister outline what actions she has taken or pressures she has put  on cash-rich housing associations to deliver additional social housing, given  the depressed market and the fact that they could purchase land at a reasonable  price?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: Housing associations, like the rest of us, live in  challenging times. I have set them a target, and I hope that they will deliver  on it. I hoped that instructing the Housing Executive to supply housing  associations with a list of the lands that it owns would enable them to build  houses much more cheaply. However, the important thing is that we build  good-quality houses that meet the standards required and in which people can  live. I hope that, with the support of everybody in the House and of my  colleagues in the Executive &mdash; and, naturally, the Minister of Finance and  Personnel &mdash; we will be able to deliver all those houses. We have increased the  number of houses built, compared with the number built under direct rule.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Housing Budget</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mr  Attwood </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development for her assessment of the  impact of the collapse in the land and property market on her Department&rsquo;s  housing budget.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name= AQO1533/09> (AQO 1533/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: There can be no doubt that the economic downturn is  biting in Northern Ireland.  Although it is generally recognised that the local economy was always going to  have to cope with a correction of the housing market, the correction has  coincided with the global credit squeeze and the loss of confidence worldwide  by lenders and investors. Public-sector house building accounts for about 10%  to 15% of the total housing output and is increasing year on year; but the collapse  has occurred in private-sector house building.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the wider departmental context, indications are that  residential land values have fallen dramatically since the peak of 2007.  Although that could lead to opportunities for the Department to acquire land at  significantly lower costs than anticipated, it has also been reflected in the  much lower receipts generated through disposals. There has been a complete  drying up of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive house-sales scheme, and  that has contributed to a substantial revenue shortfall.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In summary, with regard to the collapse of the land and  property market, the Housing Executive started the year with a potential  shortfall of &pound;60&middot;4 million in capital receipts. Bids submitted in the June and  September monitoring rounds have been partially met. The Department was also  permitted to re-direct funding from other business areas &mdash; such as social  security and urban regeneration &mdash; in the first two monitoring rounds to address  wider difficulties. A bid for &pound;36&middot;2 million, which is the remaining capital  receipts shortfall, has been submitted to the December monitoring round, and I  hope that it will be supported by the Minister of Finance and Personnel.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her answer. Does she agree that one measure of every  party&rsquo;s commitment to social housing &mdash; including that of Sinn F&eacute;in Members, who  speak, quite properly, about housing in Downpatrick, Newcastle and Castlewellan  &mdash; would be for all Executive parties, including Sinn F&eacute;in, to agree to the  proposals that the Minister tabled for an enhanced budget for the Department?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank Mr Attwood for his question, and I, of course,  agree with what he said. There needs to be consensus around the Executive  table; there needs to be collective responsibility; and there should be no  shying away from any proposals that I submit, because those will effect a  change in the downturn and will help people on the ground.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If Sinn F&eacute;in is serious about helping people, it should not  cry crocodile tears and blame others. It should try to work with its colleagues  in the Executive and support such proposals.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Several Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her response. An advantage of the downturn in sales &mdash;  if there is one &mdash; is the fact that land can be acquired from the Executive,  from councils, from Northern Ireland Water and from the Department for Regional  Development at a much cheaper rate. Is the cost factor therefore to the  Minister&rsquo;s advantage?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank Mr Shannon for his question. I do not disagree  with him, although we will have to see the outworking of the situation.  Naturally, there must be collective agreement around the Executive table on the  proposals in the December monitoring round, given that those can effect that  change. I hope that the Member will use his good offices with the Finance  Minister to obtain support for proposals on the matter.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I also hope that the Member&rsquo;s colleagues in the Executive  will support the proposals that are in the paper on housing. Social housing is  one way of contributing to providing for housing need, and it is a necessary  and valuable asset to people. Furthermore, it will help those who have been  affected by the downturn in the construction industry.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McFarland</strong>:  Given the present situation, does the Minister believe that a new budgetary  process at the end of each financial year would allow her Department to assess  more readily and, indeed, access finance in order to support her agreed targets?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I take on board what Professor Mike Smith said in that  consideration needs to be given to that issue and the social housing  development programme should be focused on. If it could be increased, it would  help the construction industry and housing need would be met. As well as  dealing with the great economic and social impacts, a valuable multiplier would  be provided to the economy.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Regneration of Omagh</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mr  Gallagher </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development to outline her  Department&rsquo;s plans for the regeneration of Omagh.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name= AQO1537/09> (AQO 1537/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: Omagh has experienced a substantial amount of  regeneration in recent years, and my Department seeks to continue that process  through the publication of a new town-centre master plan in January 2009, which  is just a few weeks away. That will be followed by a number of initiatives to  facilitate the redevelopment of land that is currently in public ownership.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Officials from the Department for Social Development are  working closely with officials in the Planning Service and Omagh District  Council to develop those plans. In addition, DSD continues to work with the  Ministry of Defence, the Department of Education and the Strategic Investment  Board to pursue the acquisition and subsequent redevelopment of the former  military sites at Lisanelly and St    Lucia. However, I must say that the  reluctance of the British Government to gift those and other military sites is  a major obstacle to their being redeveloped in a manner that will benefit the  people of Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  I thank the Minister for that encouraging news about the publication of the  master plan in the new year. I am sure that every Member agrees that Omagh is a  town that deserves a significant peace dividend. Will the Minister outline how  that master plan will relate to the Lisanelly and St Lucia sites and to the  Opportunity Omagh initiative?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: The draft master plan takes into account the potential  that is offered by the redevelopment of the two former military sites. It  considers possible uses, including the potential to create a shared educational  campus at Lisanelly. I have also agreed recently that my Department will carry  out further detailed work on the redevelopment of the historic buildings on the  St Lucia  site in order to facilitate any future use.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although an outline business case for the future use of the  St Lucia and Lisanelly sites is being considered by the Department of Finance  and Personnel, affordability continues to be a major issue for the Executive,  particularly in the absence of any commitment from the British Government to  gift those or other military sites to them.</p>

	      <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to the Opportunity Omagh project, although the  Department for Social Development welcomes new investment in Omagh &mdash;  particularly in the new bridge that the developer may provide as part of that  project &mdash; it is important to ensure that any development complements and  enhances the town, and that retail, office and business developments respect  the town centre&rsquo;s position.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Nonetheless, I am in favour of creating a positive  investment environment, and my Department will not be found wanting in that  regard. Furthermore, although the draft master plan identifies every  considerable opportunity for new development in the town centre over coming  years, it leaves the way open for a range of developments at the Opportunity  Omagh site, including several of the currently proposed anchor uses.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bresland</strong>:  Can the Minister assure Members that any future development of the St Lucia site  will respect its rich military history?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: Last year, I visited the St Lucia and Lisanelly sites, so I  understand the Member&rsquo;s point. Nevertheless, I am sure that his point will be  taken on board by his colleague the Minister of the Environment, who, along  with planning officials, will have direct responsibility for approving any  developments on the sites and for ensuring that such developments respect the  heritage and history of those areas. I am anxious to ensure that any  developments and investments in Omagh provide economic opportunities for all  its citizens, and I am sure that all Members would concur with that wish.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: That concludes Question Time. I propose that Members take their  ease until we resume the debate on the Second Stage of the Education Bill.</p>

	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Debate resumed on motion:</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That the Second Stage of the Education Bill (NIA 3/08) be  agreed. &mdash; <span class="Italic">[The Minister of Education (Ms Ruane).]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I understood that there was to be a  ministerial statement from the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development at  4.00 pm. Given that another business day has gone by, and considering the  questions that exist, surely such a statement should have been prioritised. In  fact, I thought that the statement would have been made at noon, but it appears  that it continues to be postponed. Many businesses are waiting to hear what is  happening.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I am happy to inform the Member that the Minister of Agriculture  and Rural Development will address Members immediately after this debate.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education (Ms Ruane)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Ba  d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht shuimi&uacute;il bhr&iacute;omhar &iacute; seo, agus cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an sp&eacute;is a  l&eacute;ir&iacute;odh ar gach taobh den Teach inti. Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis na Comhalta&iacute; sin a  bh&iacute; pairteach inti. Arda&iacute;odh cuid mh&oacute;r sainphoint&iacute; le linn na d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireachta,  agus tabharfaidh m&eacute; aghaidh ar oiread acu agus is f&eacute;idir agus m&eacute; ag labhairt.  Ar nd&oacute;igh, scr&iacute;obhfaidh m&eacute; chuig Comhalta&iacute; i dtaca le haon cheisteanna nach  mb&iacute;onn deis agam a phl&eacute; anois.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It has been an interesting and lively debate. I welcome the  interest that has been shown on all sides of the House, and I thank those  Members who contributed. Many specific points were raised, and I shall address  as many of them as possible. I shall, of course, write to Members on any issues  that I am unable to cover now.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will begin by addressing some of the comments that were  raised by DUP Members Mervyn Storey, Michele McIlveen and Edwin Poots. I will  respond first to the issues that were raised by Mr Storey, as Chairperson of  the Committee for Education, and I hope that I have my responses in the correct  order.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairperson and several other Members mentioned the  exemption in fair employment and treatment legislation on teacher employment. As  Members will know, that legislation is the responsibility of the Office of the  First Minister and deputy First Minister, and I consider that any change to it  would require careful consideration, public consultation and the advice of the  Equality Commission. I recognise the importance of that issue, which will be a  priority for my Department. A review will be conducted by my officials, working  closely with, and involving, key stakeholders. The review will be completed by  January 2010. Terms of reference are being finalised, and my aim is to review  opportunities for teacher employment throughout the education system and to  consider how best to promote equality of opportunity.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill addresses issues that several Members raised about  examinations and conflicts of interest. The functions of approving courses and  accrediting qualifications will rest with the Department, not with the  education and skills authority (ESA). I agree with Members&rsquo; points about the  importance of the portability of qualifications. It is important that  qualifications are portable. Young people must be able to access universities  and further education colleges throughout the island of Ireland, in England,  Scotland and Wales, and, indeed, throughout Europe.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Several Members mentioned an education advisory forum. I am  about to publish proposals on that for consultation, and I look forward to  hearing the views of the Committee and other stakeholders on that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mervyn Storey mentioned the content of the first and second  Bills. The first Bill could be on the statute books before 1 January 2010. The  powers to establish the ESA could not be commenced before that date. Therefore,  the timetables for the preparation and passage of the two Bills will overlap.  The normal arrangements for Committee, Executive and Assembly control will  ensure that the two Bills will remain synchronised.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mervyn Storey also mentioned local bodies and committees.  The legislation includes provision for the establishment of local committees,  and I look forward to working with the Committee for Education to develop their  makeup. As for the controlled schools body and the role of sectoral bodies, no  sectoral body will have statutory functions. All will have representation and  advisory roles on an equitable basis. The Committee has received the  Department&rsquo;s proposals, and I welcome its intention to work closely with the  Department and stakeholders on developing them. My Department will, of course,  also engage with stakeholders. A range of other concerns was raised, and my  officials will liaise, and continue to work, with the Committee on those.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Michele McIlveen, Mervyn Storey, Basil McCrea and other  Members commented on the single employing authority. The review of public  administration (RPA) is not about taking autonomy away from any particular  group of schools; it is about giving all schools autonomy in their own  day-to-day affairs, including, for example, controlled schools, which currently  have too little say in staffing matters. The ESA must be the single employing  authority for all schools, so that we can reap the benefits of a better planned  and better co-ordinated education workforce and greater consistency of  employment practice for staff.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Voluntary schools, like all grant-aided schools, are funded  by the taxpayer to deliver education to children. It is right that they, like  all schools, come under the new arrangements to ensure proper stewardship and  accountability for their use of public funds.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Voluntary schools have nothing to fear from the  arrangements. Their boards of governors will continue to be in charge of the  day-to-day running of the schools, and they will make employment decisions  relating to the setting of staff complements, the recruitment, management and  promotion of staff and their disciplining and dismissal. Furthermore &mdash; and for  the first time &mdash; those benefits will extend to all schools, including those in  the controlled sector.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Several Members spoke about coterminosity. The education  and skills authority will have a subregional structure that will maximise  coterminosity with other service providers, including local councils. The fact  that the structure is not being specified in legislation gives greater  flexibility in that regard. The objective is to have effective and responsive  local delivery of services within a consistent policy framework.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The education and skills authority must be a regional  organisation with a strong local presence and a focus on local delivery. Local  managers and delivery units will have the freedom to respond to local need.  They will be sensitive to, and receive input from, a committee from that area  comprising, among others, a number of local representatives. Provisions for the  establishment of some committees have been included in the first Bill.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Michelle McIlveen said that I should listen to the  Committee for Education and to its suggestions. I always do that; I have  listened to the Committee on such issues as the right to nominate governors,  the timing of the two Bills and the membership of the committee. I look forward  to the Committee&rsquo;s further consideration, and my Department and I will continue  to work closely with the Committee. However, it is a two-way process, and our  relationship needs to be based on respect.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I will not give way. Members had the opportunity to speak during  the debate. I sat and listened carefully for two hours. We have been engaging  on many of the issues.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I also listened to the familiar and oft-repeated comments  from Miss McIlveen about Irish-medium education. It is hoped that the word  &ldquo;equality&rdquo; will be to the forefront as the education and skills authority  develops. I welcome the comments on equality that were made by Members on the  Benches opposite, and I look forward to a time when children who are taught in  the Irish medium receive the equality that they deserve, along with other  children who learn through English and other languages.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I do not view the outcomes of the factors relating to the  transferors, the timing of the two Bills or the membership of the education and  skills authority as concessions: they are the outcome of democratic  accountability and engagement with the Committee, which was useful. Go raibh  maith agat as sin.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Michelle McIlveen asked about the rationale for sectoral  support. We will continue to have a pluralist system of school types, each with  its own distinctive character and ethos. It is right that each sector has a  modest amount of professional capacity to represent its interests. That will be  of particular value in equipping the sectors to engage with the education and  skills authority and one another to build the collaboration that will be  necessary to meet the challenges of delivering the new curriculum and  modernising the schools estate. That role will complement, without overlapping,  the role of the education and skills authority.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Sectoral representation is a key component of the RPA  programme. It will provide the means by which a number of non-statutory  organisations can discharge advisory representation and advocacy roles in  respect of schools of a particular character or ethos, including the controlled  sector. That will include participation in the education advisory forum and the  education and skills authority&rsquo;s area-based planning arrangements.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Support for sectoral organisations can be provided by using  existing grant-making powers, and it will not require new legislation. A number  of key principles must be reflected in those arrangements, as is the case with  area-based planning.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">No representative group will have statutory functions. They  will have advisory representation and advocacy roles, and their front-line  service provision functions will be transferred to the education and skills  authority.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to the transition of staff to the education and  skills authority, the implementation team has compiled a database of the  workforce in existing organisations. It is also in the early stages of  designing new service delivery arrangements and modelling the workforce for the  new organisation. That will take some time to complete. Every effort will be  made to avoid compulsory redundancies and to reduce voluntary redundancies, and  the current vacancy-control policy will be important in facilitating that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A number of Members asked for clarification on the administrative  savings that will result from the reforms.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As I said earlier, I am releasing today the business case  for the reforms, which sets out a detailed and rigorous analysis. There will be  a reduction of around 460 posts at senior and middle management level. Around  half of those posts are already vacant, and I am confident that the remaining  reductions can be achieved through voluntary redundancy and early retirement.  Every effort will be made to avoid compulsory redundancy. I remind Members that  those resources could be used at the front line for 700 newly qualified  teachers each year, three new primary schools and one post-primary school every  year, or funding the youth capital programme four times over.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Comments were made about the importance of the convergence  programme. I am chairing a high-level group in the sector, which includes the  cathaoirligh &mdash; the chairpersons &mdash; of all the affected organisations. That group  meets regularly across the North, and it has been functioning well. I pay  public tribute to the chairpersons for the work that they are doing. The group  discusses all of the issues and concerns that the chairpersons have for their  organisations about any aspect of the RPA. I am working in a hands-on manner in  the process, and those meetings are also attended by my permanent secretary,  deputy permanent secretary and Gavin Boyd, who is the chief executive designate  of the education and skills authority.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Questions were asked about the legality of appointing the  second-tier structure before the legislation was passed. We are looking at the  most fundamental reforms of education in a generation. They involve the  transformation of staff, assets and functions in 11 organisations to deliver a  vital public service. Change of that magnitude requires careful planning and  leadership; therefore, it is important to have senior staff in place as early  as possible. The chief executive designate has been appointed, and it is  important that we appoint several key second-tier officers to build and  maintain momentum. I draw the attention of the Members who asked that question  to the fact that a similar approach has been taken by the Library Authority and  the regional health and social services authority. I am sure that if the Members  who raised the question consult their own Ministers overseeing those  authorities, they will be reassured.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome Nelson McCausland&rsquo;s support for equality and the  issue of targeting social need. I assure Members that we will take our  statutory duties seriously as regards targeting social need and genuinely get  money to the front line and to some of our most vulnerable young people. I  welcome the fact that we are having a debate and that equality is at its core.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Comment was made on representation for controlled schools.  In taking this matter forward, I am keen to ensure that there is an effective  voice for publicly owned schools &mdash; they will no longer be known as controlled schools  &mdash; and for the transferors representative council. I recognise that education  here remains pluralist and that there is a strong desire on the part of the  various sectors to continue to play a significant role. I have agreed that  sectors will require sufficient professional capacity in order to discharge a  representation advocacy role under the new arrangements.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My Department will provide grant aid for a sectoral  representative body for the publicly owned sector on the basis of a robust  business case for funding, in the same way as grant aid for sectoral support is  to be provided to the other sectoral interests. The establishment of a sectoral  support body for publicly owned schools will place those schools on the same  footing as schools in other sectors and, therefore, will also assist in  promoting equality between all schools, irrespective of management type.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I see that Nelson McCausland has joined us. I am delighted  that equality is at the core of the debate. I absolutely reject the notion that  the Department is discriminating against youth in any way. In fact, I have put  forward proposals to the Member&rsquo;s colleague the Minister of Finance and  Personnel for further funding for the youth sector, and I look forward to  Nelson McCausland&rsquo;s active support, advocacy and representation as regards  extra funding for youth. I share his desire for further funding for the youth  sector. I hope that everyone in the House will join me in my efforts to secure  more funding for our youth.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Edwin Poots mentioned the recognition of qualifications. As  I said, the function of the accreditation of qualifications will rest with the  Department of Education, not the education and skills authority. The Department  will continue to liaise with authorities in the South and in Britain to  ensure that there is a consistent approach to the matter, with recognition of  our local qualifications. We are all in the European Union, and I am sure that  Members will agree that it is important that our young people can use their  qualifications across the length and breadth of Europe.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the comments made by my colleague John O&rsquo;Dowd. I  also welcome the support from all sides of the Assembly for the transferors&rsquo;  role. In particular, I agree with John&rsquo;s positive comment that the transferors  have played an important role in education. I want that role to continue in  three key areas: in schools &mdash; on boards of governors; in the sectoral body &mdash;  representing the needs of those schools and communities; and in the education  advisory forum &mdash; contributing to policy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I support John O&rsquo;Dowd&rsquo;s comments about UNISON, and I  absolutely share his respect for the union. I also have huge respect for the  tremendous work that it does. I hope that Members will bear with me as I answer  some of the questions that UNISON has asked. Those questions dovetail with many  of the questions that Members have asked.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The education and skills authority will not be a  super-quango. The majority of its members will be local councillors. In  addition, I will ensure that members of the authority have the skills and  experience to lead the education and skills authority; I completely take on  board Trevor Lunn&rsquo;s comments on the matter. I will also ensure that the  democratic accountability of that key public service is ensured.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">UNISON also raised other issues. I must point out that  clause 44(1) outlines a general duty:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;It is the duty of ESA to ensure that its functions  are exercised with a view to safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children  and young persons.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Thus, the education and skills authority will  strengthen that role rather than dilute it. I hope that UNISON and Members are  reassured on that point.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Many people, including UNISON members, raised the issue of  savings. I want to be clear about this matter, because it is obvious from some  comments that there is a lack of clarity. The Department of Education has  secured a budget of &pound;50 million on an invest-to-save basis for education  reforms. It is intended that, by year three, the proposed reforms will release  &pound;20 million per annum from education administrative services to front-line  education services, where the funding will make the most difference to our  children&rsquo;s lives</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: No, I will not, Basil; I listened to your comments all morning.  I will come to the Member&rsquo;s questions next.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In contrast, the Department is not aware of any detailed  proposals to back up the claim that savings could be made under the existing  arrangements and questions how they might be achieved without reducing the  existing administrative structures or cutting key education services.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">John O&rsquo;Dowd made other comments, which I welcome. Again, I  look forward to having the support of every Member when I introduce proposals  to secure money for primary schools and early-years provision. If we are to do  that, we need more resources in the education system. I welcome the fact that  every party supports those efforts. I thank Members in advance for that  support. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.] </span>I am sorry; I do not speak  Ulster Scots, but if Basil McCrea can tell me how to say &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; in Ulster  Scots, I will take an intervention from him.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will deal now with Mr McCrea&rsquo;s questions. He mentioned  the origins of the RPA. I want to remind the Member that the RPA was not invented  by the Civil Service or by direct rule Ministers; in fact, it was introduced  and launched, under devolution, by the Office of the First Minister and deputy  First Minister (OFMDFM). Who was in OFMDFM at the time? David Trimble was the  First Minister.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic"><span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: No, Basil, I have heard your comments. The Member should do his  homework, before he says that it was his colleagues in the Tories or in the  Labour party who launched it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In his comments on early years, Basil McCrea misunderstood  the Bill. Early years are already the responsibility of my Department. That  change was made by the previous Administration, but the law was not changed. It  is time to change the law and to put those key services on a firm legislative  basis.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Basil McCrea feels that the Bill may reduce autonomy &mdash; on  the contrary, autonomy for schools is a theme that runs throughout the RPA  policy and the Bill. For example, the Bill includes provision to ensure that all  schools are empowered to set their own governance arrangements. In addition,  the ESA will be the employing authority; schools will set the day-to-day  employment arrangements and decide how much responsibility that they wish to  take on. Some schools may want to be responsible for all employment matters, including  the setting of staff complements, recruitment, management, promotion, and the  disciplining and dismissal of staff. Other schools may want to pass some of  those responsibilities to the ESA, but the key point is that the choice will be  for the schools to make, not the ESA.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When Basil McCrea runs out of arguments about the Bill, he  reverts to ideological arguments. We are not discussing the transfer  arrangements from primary to post-primary education &mdash; he seemed a little bit confused  about that. The Bill is about the establishment of the ESA.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Area-based planning is not a substitute for new  post-primary transfer arrangements &mdash; it is required because the current ad hoc  arrangements have failed. They have failed because there is adversarial  competition that focuses on the needs of schools rather than on the needs of  pupils; an inefficient use of scarce resources, with 50,000 surplus places;  limited choices for some pupils; and inequality of access to the curriculum. No  public service can be delivered effectively without proper strategic planning,  and education is no exception.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the important scrutiny role of the Committee, and  I look forward to engaging further with it. I am glad that Basil McCrea put on  the record his recognition that there is a link between underachievement and  transfer. He said that I was &ldquo;allegedly&rdquo; the Minister of Education &mdash; I am the  Minister of Education. Some people in his party might have difficulty &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. There are too many conversations going on for the Minister  to be heard, and there is too much shouting across the Floor. As it is coming  up to Christmas, will Members respect the Chair for once?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Go raibh maith agat as sin. I am the Minister of Education &mdash;  that will become clear from reading Assembly documents. Thankfully, we no  longer have direct rule Ministers, from either the Tories or from the Labour  Party, coming over to Ireland  and telling us how to run anything.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Basil McCrea asked me about the transfer of responsibility  for the Youth Service to local councils, so I hope that he listens to my  answer. My policy on the RPA is founded on a recognition of the value of youth  services in education &mdash; they have particular importance for young people who  are at risk of marginalisation and exclusion. During an extensive consultation,  I did not hear any convincing argument that the needs of children and young  people would be better met by the transfer of responsibility for the Youth  Service to local government. The ESA will provide local services at the point  of contact, which would suit youth services in the same way that it suits all  education provision.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Basil McCrea was also worried that the ESA and the Bill  would be about accountability to me. I ask him to read my speech again, and I  have no doubt that he will do so &mdash; it will make nice bedtime reading. What I  said was that it should be</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;accountable to me and to the Assembly&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Will the Minister take an intervention on that point?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I have loads of questions from Basil McCrea, which I am trying  to answer, but it is very difficult because he keeps interrupting me.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to the Department being ineffective, every part  of the education system, including the Department of Education, needs to do  better and needs to refocus on the things that matter most &mdash; raising standards  and addressing inequality in education.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Under RPA, every part of the system will change, including  my Department. The Department needs to be better at making evidence-based  policy and at communicating it clearly to stakeholders. It needs to be better  at challenging and holding the education system to account for its performance  on educational attainment. It needs to be less focused on the needs of  institutions and more focused on the needs of children and young people,  particularly those who are most at risk of dropping out of education.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have already answered the question on the education  advisory forum.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to Ken Robinson&rsquo;s comments, I have already  responded to the point about quangos.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Again, I must make the point that this debate is not about  transfer &mdash; it is about the education and skills authority. I make the same  comment to Ken Robinson that I made to Basil McCrea &mdash; when they run out of  arguments, they come on to accusations of ideology.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Ken Robinson, like his colleague Basil McCrea, appears to  have difficulty with Sinn F&eacute;in holding ministerial positions. However, we are  in our positions; we respect our positions; and we respect all the other  parties and the portfolios that they hold.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am concerned about the use of language such as &ldquo;woolly  curriculum&rdquo;. We have a revised curriculum and an entitlement framework, and we  now have probably one of the best curriculums in Europe.  People know that I criticise where I feel that criticism is necessary but that  I give credit where credit is due. The curriculum has changed enormously, and  it is much better and much broader than it was before.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to the question about whether the ESA will be  too powerful, the legislation places key duties on the education and skills  authority and gives it the necessary powers to discharge its responsibilities  with appropriate checks and balances. The strongest powers in areas such as  school development, school closure, removing governors and directing schools  are contained in existing legislation, and Members will be glad to know that  those will continue to be exercisable by me as the Minister, and not by the  education and skills authority.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The draft legislation includes only one such new power for  the education and skills authority, and that is the power to direct grant-aided  schools in relation to the discharge of their child protection functions, and I  am sure that no one in the House will argue against that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The ESA will be fully accountable to me, as Minister, and  amenable to scrutiny by the Committee for Education. It is similar in that  regard to the Housing Executive and to the forthcoming library authority and  the regional health and social care board.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to Ken Robinson&rsquo;s question about the  relationship between the first and second Bill, I have listened to the  Committee on the matter, and the Executive&rsquo;s decision was that both Bills will  be taken forward. Both are essential, and the Committee will be fully involved  in the development of the policy and in the legislative provisions for the  second Bill before the first is implemented.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Ken Robinson also asked how schools will be challenged and  by whom. The challenge will be evidence based. The education and skills  authority and the boards of governors will make challenges that are based on  the evidence of results and on inspections by the Education and Training  Inspectorate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Ken Robinson asked: &ldquo;how local is local?&rdquo; The ESA will have  a subregional structure that will maximise coterminosity with other service  providers, including local councils. The fact that the structure is not  specified in legislation gives greater flexibility in that regard. The objective  is effective, responsible, local delivery of services within a consistent  policy framework, and the education and skills authority must be a regional  organisation with a strong local presence and a real focus on local delivery.  Local managers and delivery units will have the freedom to respond to specific  local need.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">They will be sensitive to the requirements of, and receive  input from, a committee from that area, comprising, among others, a number of  local representatives. I have studied carefully Sir George Bain&rsquo;s  recommendations; it is important to take those into account, and I will do so.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Dominic Bradley began by talking about my housework. In  case he is wondering, I do my own housework, and I am very good at it. I  welcome Dominic&rsquo;s concern about housework, and I hope that all Members do their  housework on the basis of equality. I note that Fred Cobain definitely does. I  remind Dominic Bradley that the debate is not about transfer arrangements or  academic selection, although it would be good to hear publicly &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. I know that Members are anxious to please the Minister by  shouting out the answers, but they will lose their gold stars eventually.  Please carry on, Minister.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Go raibh maith agat. The debate was never about transfer  arrangements or academic selection. I hope that we will have a debate in the  House on those matters. I look forward to the SDLP&rsquo;s stating its position  loudly and clearly, because I have read its party manifesto, and sometimes its  voice is very quiet on the issue of post-primary transfer. Enough of that,  however; today&rsquo;s debate is about the education and skills authority. Sin  d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht do l&aacute; eile. That is a debate for another day.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Dominic Bradley made a disparaging comment about Gerry  Adams and democracy. My party conducts democratic discussions on many aspects.  That is one of the reasons why I like being in the party, because those  discussions take place at every level. It is important that those discussions  happen in all political parties.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have already answered Dominic Bradley&rsquo;s question about  savings. He also asked about local access and interfaces. I can reassure him  that back-office functions will be centralised, but front-line support will  not. In fact, that support will be decentralised, moved closer to schools and  provided by local management units, which local committees will oversee. Mr  Bradley will be glad to hear that the ESA will consider carefully the location  of its headquarters, in line with Sir George Bain&rsquo;s recommendations.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Dominic Bradley also asked about the cost of establishing  the ESA, and I have answered that question. He also made a point about  underachievement, and I look forward to working with him, and all Members, on  that issue. I reassure Members that the business case for the ESA will be  available today. It clearly demonstrates that savings are achievable. However,  I have always said that this is not about savings but about educational  achievement, setting standards and achieving equality for our young people.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome Trevor Lunn&rsquo;s thoughtful comments, and I support  his constructive views on regional organisation and local delivery points. He  raised the issue of local councillors&rsquo; involvement and expressed his concerns.  I understand why he has those concerns, but we are in a new era. I agree with  the point that Ken Robinson made about that issue. Under the new arrangements,  councillors will play a major role, and it will be important for them to have  experience in financial management, human resources and other important areas.  My Department will ensure that adequate training is provided for those  councillors.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Trevor Lunn also raised the issue of MLAs sitting on the  board of the ESA. It would be undemocratic for an MLA to be a member of the new  education and skills authority. There would be a clear conflict of interest,  because the ESA must be accountable to me and to the Assembly &mdash; to me and the  Assembly, Basil.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Trevor Lunn spoke about the different tone of today&rsquo;s  debate. I agree with him, and I welcome that fact. I hope that we can reach  agreement on the transfer of children from primary education to post-primary  education. Trevor Lunn also spoke about the important issue of democratic  accountability. The ESA is too important to be left to a non-democratic body.  The Committee expressed its concerns, to which I listened. The education and  skills authority will be a more effective champion if it is democratically  accountable. I am sure that &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. Some Members cannot hear the Minister&rsquo;s reply. Members must  be quiet and patient. Thank you.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Thank you. I appreciate that, Mr Deputy Speaker, because my  voice has had to get louder and louder, and I still have an Executive meeting  to attend today.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I listened to the concerns that the Committee expressed. I  will ensure that the ESA&rsquo;s members have the necessary skills and competence. I  wish to consider further the precise method of appointment, in order to ensure  that the promotion of equality and recognition of diversity are reflected in  the organisation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: In conclusion, let us remember that we all became Members of the  Assembly because we want to make a positive difference to our fellow citizens&rsquo;  lives. Today, we have an opportunity to do just that. For every young person,  effective education is the key to knowledge and skills, to employment and  prosperity, and to health and well-being. For all of us together, education is  the key to a vibrant, cohesive community and to a thriving economy. We have the  opportunity to improve the life chances of today&rsquo;s children and of the  generations who will succeed them.</p>

	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Pensions (No. 2) Bill</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Further Consideration Stage</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Before we consider the statements from the Minister of Health,  Social Services and Public Safety and the Minister of Agriculture and Rural  Development, we will move to the Further Consideration Stage of the Pensions  (No. 2) Bill. I recognise that some Members wish to hear the planned statements  as soon as possible, and I assure Members that we will move to those statements  immediately after what we expect to be a very brief Further Consideration  Stage.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Will you advise the House whether  copies of those statements are available for Members yet?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Speaker</strong>: It has been pointed out to me that that is not a point of order.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">5.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr W McCrea</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker, this debate is on a very serious  matter, and people have been waiting for it all day. Why, at the end of the  day, are we still waiting for the Ministers to come to the House to report on a  matter that could have catastrophic implications for our farming industry?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: We will consider the statements immediately after we deal with a  very brief piece of Assembly business, which is, of course, very important: it  is the Pensions Bill.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I remind Members that under Standing Order 37(2), the  Further Consideration Stage of a Bill is restricted to debating any further  amendments that are tabled to the Bill. As no amendments have been tabled,  there is no opportunity to discuss the Pensions (No. 2) Bill today. Members  will, of course, be able to have a full debate at the Bill&rsquo;s Final Stage. The  Further Consideration Stage of the Bill is, therefore, concluded. The Bill  stands referred to the Speaker.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr W McCrea</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: is there a reason why we are waiting  for the commencement of statements or debate?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I do not think that that is a point of order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr W McCrea</strong>:  It is a point of order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: We will not argue. We are waiting for the Ministers who, I am  assured, will be here. I have the first statement, from the Minister of Health,  Social Services and Public Safety, and that will be made available to Members.  The other statement, from the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development,  will follow.</p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="9"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Incident of Dioxins in Pork and Pork Products  Originating from the Republic   of Ireland</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I have received notice from the Minister of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety that he wishes to make a statement regarding the  incident of dioxins in pork and pork products originating from the Republic of Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: I want to  reassure the public that the risk to health from eating potentially  contaminated pork and pork products from Northern   Ireland or the Republic   of Ireland is extremely  low. Since I was made aware of this matter over the weekend, I have had  frequent discussions with the Agriculture Minister, Michelle Gildernew; the  Chief Medical Officer, Dr Michael McBride; and the Food Standards Agency (FSA).  The Food Standards Agency has advised me that, based on the information that it  has at present, any adverse effects to health would require high levels of  exposure to those products for long periods.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The FSA is an independent Government Department set up to  protect the public&rsquo;s health and consumer interests in relation to food. The  health of the public is a major priority for me, and is something that I take  very seriously. I want to ensure that no one has any concerns about the quality  or safety of their food. However, I realise that there has been a lack of  clarity about advice on the consumption of pork and pork products.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the Republic of  Ireland, all pork products originating  from the Republic and from Northern    Ireland have been removed from retailers&rsquo;  shelves. In Northern Ireland,  however, initial advice from the FSA to the public here has been not to eat  those products, but no formal recall notice has been sent to retailers. Despite  that advice, a number of retailers have already taken the decision to remove  products from their shelves until they are certain that none of them is  contaminated. The FSA and the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development  are continuing to investigate whether any of those products contaminated by  dioxins have been distributed in the UK. Although I fully accept that  the health risk to the public is low, I also feel that the public are confused  about the messages that they are receiving.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Indeed, rather than take the risk of buying potentially  contaminated pork, it is more likely that they will be deterred from eating any  pork products at all. That is why I have requested that the FSA issues urgent  advice to retailers to temporarily remove from shelves any pork, or pork  products, that have been processed in Northern Ireland. As soon as the  relevant agencies have determined which products, if any, are contaminated,  products can safely be returned to shelves. The public can then have confidence  that any pork products on the shelves in supermarkets and butchers&rsquo; shops are  not contaminated.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On account of taking that step, I believe that consumers  will not be deterred from eating pork products and, when investigations are  complete, will be content to purchase pork from local producers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that confidence in the pork industry be  restored as quickly as possible &mdash; not just for consumers, but for local farmers  and producers. This is the busiest time of year for them and the Agriculture  Minister, Michelle Gildernew, and I, want to ensure that the impact on the  industry is minimised. I hope that the investigations will be completed as  quickly as possible and that local, quality pork products will be back on the  shelves.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement and for his quick reaction to the  situation. As he has outlined, there is a lot of confusion among the public  about pork products. For the benefit of anybody who bought pork products at the  weekend, can the Minister confirm whether or not those should be eaten? Can he  outline how long dioxins have been in animal feeds, and when the matter was  first brought to his attention?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The Food Standards Agency in Northern Ireland has told me that its first  indication of this matter was received at 10.30 pm on Saturday, when it was  contacted by its counterpart in the Irish   Republic. The FSA spent  Sunday investigating, and I had conversations with them and others, including  the Agriculture Minister.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">This is a rapidly evolving situation, which is changing  continually. Initially, the Food Standards Agency, which is a UK-wide body,  moved to advise consumers not to eat pork products labelled as produced in the Irish Republic  or Northern Ireland.  That was its first piece of advice, and that advice stands.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If customers who purchased pork products over the weekend  are concerned, the advice is not to consume it, but not to destroy it either,  as it is almost certainly safe. An investigation process must be carried out to  ensure that we can stand up and say that pork is safe.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  statement. Mr Easton touched on the question that I wished to ask: when was the  Minster informed about the situation? In unexpected situations such as this, is  there a dedicated officer within the Department of Health who contacts the  Minister? Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: As I said, the Food Standards  Agency became aware of the situation at 10.30 pm on Saturday. I was contacted,  and messages were left on my answering machine. On Sunday morning, I was at  church, and I did not hear those messages until 2.30 pm. At that point, I had  conversations with the relevant officer who looks after emergency planning in  the Department, with the Chief Medical Officer and with other individuals  concerned.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As for contamination, the Minister of Agriculture and Rural  Development will make a statement in due course regarding animal husbandry and  related matters. I am taking a view purely from a health standpoint.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The information that I have indicates that at the moment  there is no emergency. It is important that calm is maintained. The situation  is changing rapidly. I am advised that the level of dioxins present in pork  produce is so low that it would take consumption over a long time for them to  prove harmful. However, action is being taken on the advice of the Food  Standards Agency, which upholds the highest standards.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement, which helps to clarify the position. It  is reassuring to know that the risk to health is extremely low. On the other  hand, there is some risk; therefore, there is obvious concern. Clear direction  is essential, particularly for people who want to know whether to throw out or  use the bacon in their fridge. It is important that very clear leadership is  provided, and I appreciate what the Minister has said.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The question may be more relevant for the Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development, but does the Minister of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety have any information on whether there is a legal  level of dioxins in pigs?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: There is a safe level about  which I am not familiar. However, scientists say there is a safe level. In the Irish Republic,  80 to 200 times that recommended safe level of dioxins has been detected in  pork. My information is that pork products that are labelled &ldquo;Northern Ireland&rdquo;  are not in that situation. The Minister of Agriculture will be more specific,  but I understand that a tiny amount of product from Northern Ireland is affected.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, the advice is that if people have pork products  labelled &ldquo;Northern Ireland&rdquo;,  they should not destroy them; rather, they should keep them in the fridge, and  further advice will be issued in due course. The situation is changing rapidly,  and I look forward to getting more advice in due course with the support of the  director of the Food Standards Agency in Northern Ireland, Mr Gerry McCurdy.  I assure Members that he and his officials have worked constantly since they  got the information late on Saturday night in order to be absolutely certain  that their advice prevents any consumer in Northern Ireland being put at risk  of harm.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  also thank the Minister for his statement. I notice that there has been a  different reaction in the North and the South about whether to keep product on  shelves. Given the extent to which there is a shared media market, what is  being done to co-ordinate the media message and action, both North and South?  Given the proximity of Christmas &mdash; a time when people consume a lot of pork &mdash;  how quickly does the Minister believe that the all-clear will be given and that  confidence will be restored to the market in a way that enables people to buy  and butchers and supermarkets to sell pork at what is their busiest season of  the year?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I cannot be definitive about a  date. However, the FSA is considering the safety of Northern Ireland pork very closely.  It is a changing situation. My current information indicates that there is a  very, very low risk. I hope to be able to clarify that further in due course.  My request of the Food Standards Agency is that they advise retailers to  temporarily remove from their shelves any pork or pork products processed in Northern Ireland.  I stress &ldquo;temporarily&rdquo;. At present, the measure in respect of Northern Ireland  pork products is temporary. As soon as the relevant agencies establish their  concern about which, if any, products are affected, safe products may be  returned to the shelves.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">5.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his brief statement to the House. The lack of clarity  on the matter from relevant Departments at the weekend beggars belief. I note,  however, that the Minister has requested the FSA to issue urgent advice to  retailers to remove temporarily from their shelves pork and pork products that  have been processed in Northern    Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although, on the one hand, the Minister has made that  request, on the other hand, he has stated clearly that the situation is not an  emergency and that any adverse effects to health would require prolonged high  levels of exposure to contaminated products. Therefore, there is ambiguity on  the matter: although it would take large consumption of those products to cause  any adverse effects to health, retailers have been advised to remove products from  their shelves.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member must ask a question.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  If it can be proven definitively that dioxins in pork products is not a problem  in Northern Ireland because none of its produce has been found to be  contaminated, will that information be released to the public as soon as  possible in order to restore confidence among Northern Ireland&rsquo;s consumers? How  long will the temporary period last?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I have already answered the  second part of Mr Buchanan&rsquo;s question in my response to Dr Farry. As far as I  am concerned, speed is of the essence in the provision of that information.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have broad responsibility for public health. However, the  FSA was set up as an independent Government body specifically to advise on  matters that pertain to food safety and, therefore, to examine issues such as  that which is being discussed. Consumer confidence is an important concern.  This is not simply a scientific exercise: because the matter has arisen, it is  important that it is dealt with proactively pending the results of the  scientific investigation, which I hope &mdash; and I am optimistic &mdash; will, within a  short period, bring the situation to the point at which pork products that are  labelled as being from Northern Ireland do not pose a risk.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As I have said, the situation is changing rapidly. On the  basis of my current information, I do not regard the situation as an emergency.  However, the fact is that a belt-and-braces approach must be taken. That is why  I have asked the FSA to issue that advice. It has agreed to fulfil my request.  Produce must be withdrawn, but only temporarily.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Health Minister for  his statement. He has said that his current information is that the risk is  extremely low. Is that information based on scientifically tested results that  have been obtained from a laboratory? Does he await any further test results  that will allow him to either give the all-clear or to take further action if  necessary? If that is the case, when does he expect those test results to be  returned?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: It is a scientific exercise. The  Food Standards Agency applies a great deal of expertise to the matter. The  Minister of Agriculture is in a better position than I am to discuss how many  farms purchased feed from the supplier in question. However, I am aware that  the number keeps reducing; therefore, the risk keeps reducing. The scientific  basis of the advice that I get from the Food Standards Agency is firmly  grounded in the discipline.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Other Members have asked about the time frame. I cannot be  definitive about the precise time that it will take to resolve the situation;  however, it will absolutely be done as quickly as possible. I have emphasised  and reinforced the message, over and over again, that the matter must be  resolved as quickly as possible.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr W McCrea</strong>:  As the vast majority of pig farmers in Northern Ireland have never used feed  from that particular mill, and it is also possible to trace and isolate any  product that may have come from animals that have been fed with suspect feed,  why is the produce of pig farmers in Northern Ireland being kept off shelves  here and in Great Britain?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The Minister of Agriculture and  Rural Development is better able than me to answer that question. I am not  entirely sure whether the origins of pork can be determined after it has been  processed in a factory. I believe that there is a question mark about that and,  therefore, we have taken this step. The Irish Republic  has deemed it appropriate to take its pork products off the shelves. We are  taking Northern Irish pork products off the shelves temporarily to allow us to  go through this process. I anticipate that pork will be allowed to go back on  the shelves after that, but my broad responsibility for public health means  that we must undertake that exercise.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That is why we have the Food Standards Agency, which is a  standalone organisation. It is entirely independent of the Department of  Health, and it provides independent advice. The FSA emerged as a result of the  BSE crisis some 20 years ago, when expert advice was not readily available.  Perhaps rightly, there was a commensurate adverse public reaction against the  entire industry at that time. However, things are different now. The expertise  is available, and as the Minister, it is my responsibility to act on the expert  advice.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I agree with the Minister that the Food Standards Agency was set up to deal  with exactly this type of situation and to build public confidence. The advice  that FSA gives must be clear. The Minister also mentioned that this is an  evolving situation. If the developments are positive, will the Minister make  officials available to brief the Health Committee later this week?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I will be happy to do that.  However, just at the moment, I do not want to take officials away from the  immediate issue that they are dealing with. The Health Committee will have a  strong interest in this matter and, no doubt, they will want to talk to  departmental officials, particularly those from the Food Standards Agency.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. There are clearly issues about how the  matter has been managed, both within Government and between Governments, North  and South. The Minister has advised the House that his officials became aware  of the problem late on Saturday night. However, it was brought to the attention  of the Minister of Agriculture, or at least to her Department, on Friday.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I want the Minister to create some certainty and avoid  doubt. Can he reassure the House that the problem &mdash; which we assume is not of  an emergency nature &mdash; affects only pork and does not extend to feed that has  been given to other animals? When did the Minister issue urgent advice to the  FSA asking that pork products be temporarily removed from the shops? Will the  Minister confirm that the FSA has accepted his advice and issued that  instruction to all shops?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I am not in a position to  comment on when other people received the information. The FSA received the  information at 10.30 pm on Saturday. The matter was then investigated, and  attempts were made to contact me on Sunday morning. Those attempts were  successful early on Sunday afternoon.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am also not in a position to answer the Member&rsquo;s question  about the effects on other animals. I assume that the Minister of Agriculture  will be able to address that matter.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Member repeat his final question?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  When did the Minister issue urgent advice to the FSA? Will he confirm whether  it accepted that advice?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The FSA has agreed to my  request, and produce will be temporarily withdrawn. That request was sent to  the FSA at lunchtime today, around noon or 12.30 pm.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  What message does the Minister have for the hundreds of workers in Stevenson  and Company at Cullybackey and for the 630 workers in Grampian Country Pork at  Cookstown? What general message does he have for consumers in Northern Ireland?  Is he issuing a clear clarion call that our pork produce is safe and is safe to  eat, or is he issuing a message that we must wait and see temporarily?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The country has encountered enough problems with a lack of  confidence in commerce and banking, and the Minister must accept that we cannot  afford a lack of confidence in agriculture. How long will that temporary measure  last? Why is our produce being withdrawn, by order, from shelves in Northern Ireland, whereas in the Republic of Ireland &mdash; where the problem originated &mdash;  the retailer can decide whether to remove produce from the shelves? Will the  Minister outline a clear and distinct action plan, or do we have a case of  over-reaction fever?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: As I have indicated, the Food  Standards Agency was established, and operates, for good reasons. It ensures  safety in the food industry, which is an important part of the Northern Ireland  economy. In my opinion, it operates to the highest standards.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member asked about factory workers in Cullybackey and  Cookstown. Although I am optimistic that the Department will take the next step  and declare the all-clear, the Food Standards Agency must adhere to steps in  order to reach that point. Those steps will be taken as quickly as possible.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member mentioned the differential between here and the Irish Republic.  The Food Standards Agency advised that any product that is labelled Irish  Republic will be withdrawn from the shelves and destroyed, whereas Northern  Ireland produce will be recalled and held before it is returned to the shelves.  There is a handling difference. Some feed has been purchased from a supplier in  the Irish Republic, and that fact poses questions  for our industry. I am not in a position to sweep that issue under the carpet.  However, I must go through steps, I am aware of what hangs on this matter, and  I am aware of the dangers of over-reaction, and I want to avoid that. As I  said, it is not an emergency; it is a rapidly changing situation, and I am  optimistic that we can reach the desired point.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  The Minister&rsquo;s statement provides no clarity and, therefore, I want to probe  further. The statement says that Northern Ireland pork will be  removed from the shelves. However, it does not mention Republic of Ireland  pork. Although I think that I understand the message, will the Minister make it  absolutely clear what is happening to pork from the Republic of Ireland,  where the problem originated?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister indicate whether he has received any  evidence that pigs produced in Northern    Ireland have consumed the contaminated  product?</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">5.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I will read the Member the  communication that I have received from the Food Standards Agency:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The agency is to initiate a product recall of all  pork and pork products that have been sourced from the Republic of Ireland,  which are to be removed from the food chain and destroyed.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is the answer to the Member&rsquo;s question. As far  as Northern Ireland  is concerned, products will be recalled, but I anticipate that that will be  temporary &mdash; to allow this exercise to be completed so that the products can go  back on the shelves. On the issue of the sourcing of feed, the Minister of  Agriculture is in a better position to answer questions than I am.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  There has been some concern among Members about the delay in bringing this  matter before the House, but I am sure that the Minister has been working on it  throughout the day. Will he advise us what communications he has been able to  have, either with the public or with the appropriate authorities, to tackle the  matter with alacrity? There has also, obviously, been some concern about the  long-term implications. How does the Minister intend to communicate the  all-clear to the public, if that all-clear is given? Will it be communicated by  his office, by the media, or by the FSA? Where should we look for the most  up-to-date information?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: When advice is given, I am sure  that there will be no shortage of media outlets anxious to carry that news. I  will certainly consider it at the time, but general advice and information will  be provided, and I am sure that no one who has an interest in either producing,  processing, purchasing or consuming pork products will miss that advice.  Retailers will also play an important role in that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As for working with alacrity, I can only repeat that the  Food Standards Agency was communicated with for the first time at 10.30 pm on  Saturday; it worked away, and then communicated with me on Sunday morning, and  we have been in communication ever since. I have had several meetings and  conversations with the Minister of Agriculture, with my officials, with the  Food Standards Agency &mdash; and with the First and deputy First Ministers at a  meeting around an hour ago. We all recognise the seriousness of the situation,  and are looking for a way to get out of it. On the basis of the information  that I currently have &mdash; and I await further advice and guidance &mdash; I do not  regard this as an emergency. We must not talk ourselves into a crisis when  there is no crisis.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I declare an interest as a pork retailer. The Minister has stated that the risk  from eating any contaminated pork or pork products from Northern Ireland  is extremely low. He has also drawn a comparison between the treatment of  products from the Republic of Ireland and that of products from Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Yesterday, on the 24-hour news, a scientist clearly stated  that there would be no detrimental effect from this product, were one to eat it  for breakfast, lunch, dinner and supper for a year. If that is the sort of  scientific evidence that has been presented, how on earth can the Minister make  a decision today to ensure that Northern    Ireland products have to be taken off the  shelf and then stored? I am sure he is aware of the perishable nature of any  goods that are taken off the shelf. Unless the situation is turned around  within a couple of days, there will be a problem with those products as well.  Clearly, there is a need for some direction from the Minister in relation to  this matter. I respect his position and &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member must ask a question.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  The question is how come the Minister has made this decision, when the  scientific evidence from the experts is that there is no problem.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I can only repeat what I have  said already: I have expert advice, and I act on such advice. The situation is  changing rapidly. There is a difference between us and the Republic of Ireland  in that we can speak authoritatively about our own product in our jurisdiction,  but we cannot speak authoritatively about that in the Irish Republic.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I believe that if someone were to eat the product for  breakfast, lunch, dinner and supper for 365 days of the year they would be safe  as far as dioxins are concerned, but I would fear for that person&rsquo;s  cholesterol.</p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="10"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Current Animal Feed Contamination</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I have received notice from the Minister of Agriculture and Rural  Development that she wishes to make a statement regarding the current  animal-feed contamination.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development (Ms Gildernew)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a  LeasCheann Comhairle. I am very grateful to have the opportunity to bring  information to the House about the developing difficulty that pig producers in  the North face.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I listened to the Health Minister&rsquo;s statement and to the  questions that came from that. It is worth reminding people that this is an  evolving situation. We are getting information as we speak, and we have been  working closely together on this matter. I accept that several questions that  were directed to the Health Minister will probably also be directed at me. We  want to get as much information as possible to Members and to be open and  transparent about the issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On Friday 5 December 2008, the authorities in the South  advised us that potentially contaminated animal-feed material had been exported  to nine premises in the North. We took action to identify the relevant  premises, and we placed immediate restrictions on the movement of animals and,  where appropriate, products in order to ensure that no further potentially contaminated  meat could enter the food chain. That remains the position.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My inspectors from the Department followed up the potentially  contaminated feed to identify what happened to it. They visited all nine  businesses today and took samples of feed from the identified supplier. The  situation is evolving, but I want to supply the Assembly with the information  that has been gathered so far. More information will potentially be available  over the next number of hours and days, and we will continue to keep the Assembly  updated.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I reassure the Assembly that the Executive are taking  prompt, effective and joined-up action to deal with this matter. We take our  joint responsibility for food safety very seriously. Primary responsibility  rests with the Food Standards Agency, which is a non-governmental organisation  that is tasked with regulating food standards and which is a body that is  outside my remit. From the outset, I have kept in close contact with the Health  Minister, Michael McGimpsey, to offer him advice from the perspective of the  Department of Agriculture and Rural Development and to ensure that he is fully  apprised of the information that my Department received from its counterparts  in Dublin. We  have also ensured good links with the Dublin  authorities, and I spoke to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food,  Brendan Smith, on Sunday. He updated me on the rationale for the decision that  the Dublin  authorities made.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">At official level, staff have been liaising closely with  officials in the Food Standards Agency, Invest NI, the Department of Health,  Social Services and Public Safety, and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment. There was also frequent contact with representatives of the farming  and meat-processing industries over the weekend.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It may be helpful if I explain to the House in more detail  what we have been doing as regards the implications of this matter for  producers and processors. As soon as we were informed about the potential  contamination, we restricted six affected herds that are on APHIS (animal and  public health information system) Online, which is the Department&rsquo;s animal  traceability system. We also put a marker on APHIS to alert meat-inspection  staff if animals from those affected herds were presented for slaughter.  Furthermore, we spoke to the Food Standards Agency to share information and  advice.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">During Saturday night and Sunday, I had a number of  discussions with my Chief Veterinary Officer and senior DARD officials to take  advice and gather further information as events developed. On Sunday,  veterinary staff spoke to the Northern Ireland Meat Exporters Association  (NIMEA) about the implications for its members. We undertook to notify NIMEA if  we discovered that its members had slaughtered any animals from the affected  premises.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Today, we carried out tracings on animals that were being  sent to slaughter, and we notified affected meat plants. The Department is  liaising closely with slaughter premises to identify whether any animals from  the identified premises in the South may have been slaughtered here since 1  September 2008.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department took samples from those premises to check  whether there has been any contamination. My permanent secretary is chairing a  group of senior officials, including the chief veterinary officer, to oversee  our response to the situation. We take the matter very seriously, and I believe  that we are responding proactively and proportionately to it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The FSA&rsquo;s advice is to recall and destroy pork products  from the South and to take products from the North off shelves, hold them and  investigate further until more information becomes available. The advice to  consumers remains not to consume pork produced here or in the South. Retailers  and wholesalers should, for the moment, retain any pork products, thus not  allowing product to enter the food chain until the Food Standards Agency  determines the way forward.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am conscious of, and concerned about, the implications  for producers and processors. Inevitably, processors will not wish to slaughter  animals when it is unclear whether that meat can be allowed to enter the food  chain or what consumer demand will be. Moreover, there are serious issues about  producers keeping animals beyond the point at which they expected to send them  to market. Therefore, there may be welfare implications, so the Department and  the Executive must urgently consider how to help the industry through this  difficult time.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the South, the authorities have taken pre-emptive  measures to remove potentially contaminated product from the food chain.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I recognise that all this is a severe blow to the industry,  especially, as Members have said, during these difficult economic times, and at  Christmas, when the demand for products such as ham and bacon is normally high.  Nevertheless, I assure Members that I will do everything that I can to support  the FSA and to restore consumer confidence in our food sector. Ultimately,  ensuring consumer confidence in pork and bacon products and ensuring that the  pig industry does not suffer any further blows is what drives all those  measures.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">This is an evolving situation to which we must respond, and  it represents a huge challenge to an important industry. Therefore, it is vital  that we all work together. Later today, I will meet Executive colleagues again  to discuss the issue, and, as the Minister of Health said, we met the First  Minister, the deputy First Minister and the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment in order to apprise them of the situation. Furthermore, in the next  day or two, I expect to call a meeting to further brief, and to discuss the way  forward with, industry representatives.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although I hope that that clarifies some of the matters  about which Members asked, I accept that people are anxious for information, so  I will attempt to be as open and as transparent as possible. Go raibh maith  agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development (Dr W McCrea)</strong>:  Veterinary officials from throughout Europe  are due to meet tomorrow, and, no doubt, this is one of the matters that will  be discussed. Will the Minister assure the House that Northern Ireland  pig farmers are not included in any potential blanket restrictions that the EU  may apply?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Moreover, given that the Minister&rsquo;s counterparts in the Irish Republic  were aware of the matter last Monday, will she explain to the House why  officials in her Department were made aware of it only on Friday afternoon?  What happened between Monday and Friday, and, given the supposed consultation  and co-operation between the relevant office in the Irish  Republic and the Minister&rsquo;s office,  why did she have to wait until Sunday to speak to the Minister in the Irish Republic,  from where the problem comes?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, will the Minister and her Department send a  clear message to farmers, processors and consumers that pig meat can continue  to be processed and eaten safely? She acknowledged that there are welfare  implications if animals must stay on farms. What are the implications for farmers  who have lost, and are losing, their entire source of income, and what will the  Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) do about that?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: On the Chairperson&rsquo;s first question, the  FSA in Britain  is already discussing with the EU the way forward for producers here.  Nevertheless, I hope that our immediate action will prevent further  restrictions being placed on pig products from the North.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The timeline of events is as follows: on Friday afternoon,  six affected herds were restricted on the Department&rsquo;s traceability system.  Divisional veterinary officers then began to contact keepers of affected herds  to discuss that restriction, and the Department adjusted the status on APHIS in  order to alert meat-inspection staff if animals from affected herds were  presented for slaughter. Moreover, we alerted the Department&rsquo;s quality-assurance  branch, which is responsible for animal feed.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">5.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Senior officials in my Department spoke to the FSA to share  information and advice on the potential risks to consumers and the restrictions  that DARD would put in place. That was a precautionary approach, as the scale  of the contamination was not known, as that result was not yet available.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">To answer the Chairperson&rsquo;s question, the Southern  officials did not know the seriousness of the matter until Friday, when test  results came back. They were aware that there was a problem, and they had  carried out tests, but it takes three days for test results to come back. It  was Friday afternoon before they realised that this was an issue of which we  needed to be made aware, and they notified my Department on Friday afternoon.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I was notified of the matter on Saturday, and I spoke to  the chief veterinary officer and senior officials on Saturday. I spoke to the  Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in the South on Sunday morning. I  spoke again to my chief veterinary officer on Sunday morning, and I spoke to  the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety early on Sunday  afternoon.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The situation was evolving, and we were finding out  information as it developed. We wanted to act proportionately. We did not want  to overreact, but, equally, we did not want to under-react and face possible  European Commission questions about how we dealt with the situation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We all remember previous food scares, particularly those  that occurred across the water, when Ministers gave assurances that products  were safe but had to go back on those assurances and inform the public of a  different position. We wanted to err on the side of caution and, as the Health  Minister said, to take a belt-and-braces approach to the issue and ensure that  we were able to protect our consumers. Equally importantly, we wanted to  protect our pig industry and to show that we had taken decisive action in order  to protect it from further difficulties.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Doherty</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Will the Minister clarify  references that she made in the early part of her statement to nine premises  and businesses, and her later references to six affected herds? Did her  officials and the FSA have any indications of the problem from their own  surveillance of the industry, or did the first indication of the problem come  from the Southern authorities last Friday?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: First, as the Member rightly pointed  out, I said that nine businesses were flagged. Two of those are non-farming  businesses &mdash; one of them is a haulage company, and the other is a feed company.  Six herds were involved, but several non-farming businesses were affected,  which explains the difference in the figures.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, no dioxin testing was carried out here. Pork fat  was tested in the South and was flagged as a potential problem. Southern officials  then came to us and said that there was a possible problem with pork products.  The issue was, therefore, first identified in the South and relayed to us.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her explanation. What action will she take to protect  the Northern Ireland  pork industry, and what further measures will be required to protect the large  number of pig farmers who have not used that contaminated food?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: We must show that we have acted quickly  to inform ourselves fully of whether contamination exists and how widespread it  might be. At present, there are 350 to 400 commercial pig farms in the North  and about 35,500 breeding sows. About 30,000 pigs are slaughtered each week in  the North, about 30% of which come from the South.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We responded in the way that we did because we wanted to be  sure that no contaminated produce reached supermarket shelves and to ensure  that consumers did not feel that we had not acted decisively and quickly. We  want to take a joint approach to the matter. As I said, we had discussions with  the Health Minister over the weekend. We also spoke to the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment today about the ongoing implications for the industry. For example,  Invest NI is considering ways to mitigate potential future impacts on the  export of pork products.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We have visited the nine businesses that have been  affected, and we have taken away samples of feed, which will be tested. If  results show that there are no contaminants in the feed and we can be sure that  animals in the North were not fed contaminated feed, we will know that we took  the action over the weekend that was necessary to protect consumer confidence.  It is an evolving situation. On completion of the tests, receipt of the results  and release of the relevant information, it is hoped that we will be able to  allay any public fears and concerns and that the public will know that we took  the action that was necessary to provide full confidence in pork products, such  as bacon and ham.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department wants to have things back on an even keel as  quickly as possible. We need to show that we were on top of things over the  weekend and that we wanted consumers to have full confidence in all our  products and to continue to buy our high-quality local produce.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her statement, although, as I said earlier, I would  have preferred it if she had made it six hours earlier, because another working  day has passed, and producers, processors and retailers are waiting to hear of  developments from the Assembly. Information was scarce over the weekend.  However, I am thankful to the Minister&rsquo;s officials for the useful update that I  received around lunchtime.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister said that she spoke to the Minister of Agriculture,  Fisheries and Food, Brendan Smith, on Sunday. At what time on Sunday did the  Minister speak to the Republic&rsquo;s Minister? Was that the first time that the  Minister had spoken to Brendan Smith since the news of the contamination was  announced?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">What is the Minister&rsquo;s assessment of a similar threat to  other farming industries, such as beef, dairy production and poultry?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: If I had made this statement six hours  ago, it would have been a lot lighter, because we have been out on farms all  day and trying to ascertain information that would help us provide as much  detail as possible to the Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I spoke to Brendan Smith at 10.30 am on Sunday. I had  spoken to the Chief Veterinary Officer late on Saturday evening and was unable  to get in contact with Brendan Smith on Saturday night. I spoke to him first  thing on Sunday morning, and I have been working on the issue all through  Sunday and all day today.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We have robust traceability systems, and APHIS contributes  to those. Once an animal goes for processing, there are different ways of  identifying exactly from where it came &mdash; especially with red meat. We are  seeking to find out to what farms the contaminated feed was sent. First, we  need to ascertain whether any of the contam&shy;inated feed ended up in farms in  the North. After that, we will take proportionate action. However, we have to  wait for the results of the testing to come through. The farms are flagged;  they are restricted. If the animals have been fed with contaminated feed, the  product will not be allowed to enter the food chain.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, we want to ensure that we are doing everything we  can to alleviate consumers&rsquo; concerns. That is why people were advised not to  eat pork products. The Department has been proportionate and measured in its  response. We have been responsible; we have not overreacted or under-reacted.  We do not want to create a situation in which it will seem as if we are closing  the stable door after the horse has bolted. We do not want that to happen; we  want consumers to be confident that we acted quickly and proportionately to the  situation as soon as we heard about it.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  thank the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development and the Minister of  Health for their statements. It is clear that the majority of Members accept  that a precautionary approach was needed over the weekend, but I was concerned  when the Minister started to talk about such things as the future welfare  implications of keeping animals beyond the point at which they would, normally,  have been slaughtered. If APHIS is working properly, surely it should be  possible to determine speedily that a large proportion of pigs in Northern Ireland  are free from any possible threat of contamination.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">At what stage will the Minister be able to tell officials  in Brussels  that despite the fact that our cattle and sheep were Irish at the time of the  foot-and-mouth disease outbreak, our pigs are British?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I think that I will be able to concur  with the Member and come back in a few days&rsquo; time to say that pigs reared here  are safe for consumption and that there are no food safety issues. However, we  must wait for the results of the tests on the meal samples that officials took  away from the farms that they visited today. That feed will be tested, we will  find out whether it is contaminated, and we will take whatever appropriate  steps are necessary. However, in the first instance, we must find out whether,  and to what extent, contaminated feed was fed to animals here.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  already pointed out, the situation is evolving, and we will act proportionately  as the information is received. However, Members must understand that the  situation will be rolled out over the next few days, and although it is  frustrating that we do not have all the information, we cannot have it all now.  APHIS will be a tool, and it will help us to give consumers confidence.  However, the tests must be carried out, and it will take a few days for the  results to come through.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  The Minister said that she realises that the matter will be a severe blow to  the industry with Christmas looming, because it is one of its busiest times. We  have heard on the radio today that consumers are being encouraged to take their  products back, and, if there is a threat to health, that is the correct  procedure. However, that will have a knock-on effect on the industry. Has the  Minister any plans for a package of support for those farmers who will be  affected, and will she put forward a better business case for them than she did  for those farmers who were affected by the flooding?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: As the Member pointed out, I said that this  is a severe blow to the industry. To be honest, anything that has a detrimental  impact on the pig industry is severe. Our pig farmers are the most resilient  people; they have been through so much, and they have kept going and continued  in business. I have a great deal of respect for pig farmers. We do not want  anything to happen that would impact on their businesses. We want to help them  to continue in business.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I believe that we will be able to give the green light to  many of the pigs here and that they will be able to go for slaughter and be  available for the Christmas market. I will have to talk to Executive colleagues  about a package. As I already said to members of the Committee for Agriculture  and Rural Development and others, the business case on the flooding to which Mr  Clarke referred had to be based on figures, and it was a straightforward  economic decision, whereas I went to the Executive and made a social hardship  case for those farmers who had been affected. They are two very different  matters. In this case, it will be a mixture of both, with decisions being based  more on social issues than economic ones.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Invest NI is responsible for working with food-processing  companies that export our pig products and for improving productivity by  becoming more internationally competitive. It is considering several measures  to reassure buyers; for example, it is targeting British pork and bacon buyers  with a view to visiting the North in order to meet the industry&rsquo;s producers and  processors. If necessary, Invest NI suggests mailing all buyers and reassuring  them of the safety of pork and bacon from the North. We will also use the trade  press to put forward a positive message.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">All the agencies must work together &mdash; including me, as  Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, the Minister of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety and the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment. We are all working to ensure that our pig sector does not have any  further difficulties in these challenging times. I assure the House that the  sector has my full support and confidence, and I want to do all that I can to  help to keep it in business.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s quick  response to this serious issue. The release of dioxins into the food chain can  have a devastating impact on the agriculture sector, which is one of the main  reasons that I am totally opposed to incineration. What will be the knock-on  effect for processors and for jobs in the processing sector?</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">6.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I hope that as the testing evolves, the  situation will be short-lived and the industry can soon get back to normal. I  hope that there will be no impact on jobs. Obviously, I am concerned about the  sector, and I want those processing jobs to remain. The sooner the necessary  information is available, the better for everybody. That is one of the reasons  why there is such a sense of urgency about the matter &mdash; we want people to  continue in their jobs. The processors will be told when they can go back to  slaughtering and processing pigs as soon as possible.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Irwin</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her statement. I have spoken to a number of pig processors  today, and there is a lot of concern about what the coming days hold for them.  It is important that the issue is dealt with speedily. The Minister has told us  that six farms are under restriction at the moment. Of those six farms, how  many are pig farms, and how many pigs are involved?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: As I said, six herds have been  restricted. At this stage, I do not have the information that the Member seeks.  The farms have been visited today and samples of meal have been taken. However,  I do not have the numbers that the Member is asking for &mdash; unless I am being  handed them now. We have taken samples, and we will forward that information to  the Food Standards Agency, which will respond to any risks identified. The situation  is evolving. The officials are on farms today, and I hope to have the necessary  information tomorrow.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I thank the Minister and her officials for their response and the progress that  they have made. Obviously, public health must be a key priority. The Minister  has alluded to the timescale involved, and I want to press her further on that.  Tests are being carried out on farms and within other units that have been  mentioned. If on-farm contamination is found not to be a factor, what is the  realistic timescale for getting food products back into the marketplace and on  to the shelves? I would like a ballpark figure.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: The results of the tests should be back  mid-week, and if they are clear, we will be able to resume business straight  away, I imagine, or as soon as possible. If they show that contaminated feed  has been fed to animals, we will have to make a different response.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The situation is very much evolving. We will provide the  information to the Food Standards Agency, as we get it, and we will continue to  keep it apprised of the situation. It will take three days to get the relevant  information, so it will be the middle of the week before we know the exact  level of contamination. After that, we will take the appropriate and necessary  action.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burns</strong>: I  do not need to tell the Minister that the scare has been devastating for local  pig farmers and that there is a tremendous loss of public confidence in all  pork products. It was only a few months ago that I really started to understand  about dioxins in food, when I heard the presentations about the proposed  incinerator in Glenavy and the great dangers of incineration and toxins. I ask  the Minister to reassure the public that we are not at serious risk from toxins  in any other foods.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I do not need to tell the Member that if  we had not acted while the South of Ireland was taking decisive action, that  would have been a bigger blow to consumer confidence and the pig sector. Some  30% of pigs slaughtered here each week are from the South, and if we had not  taken action, a question mark would have hung over pork products from the North  for some time. We took action to sustain and support the pig sector here.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Feedstuffs in the feed mills here are tested routinely &mdash;  there are approximately 12 tests for dioxins in feed mills every year. There  are other tests with respect to animal health and with respect to identifying  what is contained in food. Therefore, there is a robust testing regime, and it  is important that tests on feedstuffs continue so that we are assured that no  contaminants can get into the food chain.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are other issues, such as how environmental contaminants  can affect food, but I will not be discussing those today. We are doing  everything possible to protect, enhance and guarantee the safety of our  produce, whether it is pork, beef or milk. We are doing everything possible to  ensure that our animals, and the feedstuffs that they live on, are fit for  consumption.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. A number of pork processing plants across the North have  been mentioned, and there are several in my constituency. Who is responsible  for liaising with pork processors at this stage to keep them in the loop and to  provide them with as much up-to-date information as possible? Is it the FSA or  the Department?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: There are four pork processors in the  North, of which Grampian Country Pork in mid-Ulster is the biggest,  slaughtering 20,000 pigs per week. As other Members mentioned, we also have  William Grant and Co, Stevenson and Company, and Foyle Meats. We have been in  touch with the pig processors and discussed the situation with them over the  weekend and today, and the FSA will also be in contact with them. We need to  work together to ensure that information is passed on and decisions are taken.  Processors are being kept apprised of the situation as it develops.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Will the Minister confirm that no pig or pork produce from Northern Ireland  has been identified as having dioxin levels over the safe limit? Will she also  confirm that no other animal product from Northern Ireland has been  identified as having dioxin levels over the safe limit? Is there any evidence  that pigs in Northern    Ireland have been given any of the feed that  the contaminated pigs in the South of Ireland were fed? Does the Minister  recognise that she has 48 hours to turn this situation around and to get pork  back on the shelves, or, instead of boosting consumer confidence, the actions  taken today will be hugely detrimental to consumer confidence?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: As I said in answer to previous  questions, it is too early to be definitive. We need to know whether contaminated  feed has been given to animals here. Further tests will be carried out post  mortem, so we will be in a situation in which we a culling animals. We want to  be proportionate and measured in what we do and be sure that that does not have  a detrimental impact on consumer confidence.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There have not been any positive tests for dioxins to date,  so I am content that we have done everything that we can to ensure the safety  of our food. We are doing everything that we can to ensure that the issue is dealt  with as speedily as possible, but in a proportionate and measured way so that  we are not seen to be overreacting. I do not like to repeat myself, but we do  not want to overreact to any situation, but, equally, we want to be seen to be  taking action and taking all the necessary precautions to ensure consumer  confidence.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her statement. Twice, she has mentioned the six herds.  Will she confirm that those are pig herds only? The Minister said that she will  do everything that she can to restore consumer confidence, and I have no doubt  that that is what she wants to do. However, will she confirm that pig meat that  is produced and processed in Northern    Ireland is safe to eat?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That is all that the public need to hear in order for  confidence to be boosted. The public must be assured that pig meat is safe to  eat because it has been produced and processed in Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I said already that it is too early to  determine whether other farm animals have been fed contaminated feed. We have  taken samples, but we do not yet know whether any feed is contaminated, and if  so, whether such feed has been used. I hope that the results of that sampling  exercise will show that there is no contaminated feed in the North.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My officials are engaging fully with the farms in question.  The FSA is tasked with defining the level of risk to consumers, but we are  responsible for what happens on farms. We pass information on to the FSA, and  it makes decisions that are based on that information.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her statement. The public is greatly lacking  confidence about the matter, and there is a great deal of uncertainty and  confusion. I am not certain that the Minister&rsquo;s statement will restore  confidence. I hope that it does, but I am not certain.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I also wish to highlight the lack of mention of the  European institutions in the Minister&rsquo;s statement. I wonder why mention of  those bodies is absent. Will the Minister reassure the House that she has  communicated with the EU, at whatever appropriate level, in order to clarify  the position and to avoid any blanket ban on pork products from Northern Ireland?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: The European Commission is aware of the  situation as it evolves. Its concern is that prompt and effective action is  taken in order to address any potential risk. If I were to tell the House today  that we had not taken any action and that the FSA had not made any  recommendations, the European Commission would take a very dim view of our lack  of response. The FSA in the UK  is the authoritative body on matters such as this, and it liaises with the EU.  The European Commission has been in contact with the FSA, but it is important  that we give any available information to the Minister of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety and the FSA and that the European Commission is  aware of the situation as it evolves.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  As other Members said, there is no doubt that the situation is causing great  concern in the pig industry. The Minister mentioned that Grampian Country Pork,  which is based in my constituency, processes about 20,000 pigs a week, 11,000  of which come from Northern Ireland,  while the remaining 9,000 come from the Irish Republic.  Will the fact that there are now few or no pigs coming from the Irish Republic  to Northern Ireland  have an impact on jobs, given that not enough pork will be processed for  retail? Time is of the essence, and I am sure that the Minister will do as much  as she can to ensure that the situation is resolved in the short term, because  that is what the industry needs to hear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I agree that time is of the essence. My  officials have been in constant contact with Grampian Country Pork over the  weekend in order to assist it. I visited the Grampian factory this time last  year. About 30% of our processing capacity comes from the South, and if pigs  are not being processed here in the North, there is a potential knock-on impact  on jobs. I am keen to ensure that that does not happen.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">6.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The processing sector across the island has quite a small  capacity, and we have witnessed the sharp decline of the pig sector over the  past decade or two. About one third of the pigs that are processed here are  from the South. Given those figures, if we had not taken decisive action this  weekend, people would have asked whether we were sure that the pigs that were  processed in the North had not come from the affected farms in the South, and  there would have been question marks over the safety of our pork. From a  consumers&rsquo; point of view, we have to be seen to be taking action on the matter.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. I thank the Minister for her statement. I also  congratulate her on taking swift action in dealing with the matter, which is  the best way in which to build confidence with the industry. Does the Minister  agree that if Minister Smith had taken swifter action in informing her of the  situation in the South, that would have led to a speedier reaction and an  opportunity to test the pig feed at an earlier stage?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: As I said, officials from the South  corresponded with my departmental officials on Friday, enabling my Department  to restrict those herds as soon as it received that information. This is an  evolving situation. It was late on Friday afternoon before officials in the  South realised the severity of the situation. I suppose that it would have been  useful to have had earlier correspondence from the Minister in the South.  However, from past experience, I know that when we had to deal with a  situation, we thought first about contacting the people who were directly  involved.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I suppose, from that point of view, officials were engaging  at that level, but the Minister had not been in touch with me. However, the  important thing is that we got the information in time for my Department to  take decisive action in restricting those herds on Friday. The fact that officials  were liaising with one another meant that we were able to act quickly.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I also thank the Minister for her response. I declare an interest as a pork  retailer. I represent an area where four people are in the business of  manufacturing pork products: two businesses produce and manufacture sausages;  and the other two businesses produce and manufacture cooked meats. I am sure  that the Minister is well aware that it is at this time of the year that  producers sell gammon and people sit down to turkey-and-ham dinners. That was  the situation before the lull today. How are we now to deliver those products?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">With respect, will the Minister explain why her officials  were not contactable over the weekend? The Minister&rsquo;s statement says that the  Northern Ireland Meat Exporters&rsquo; Association had met veterinary staff on  Sunday. I am not sure whether they met behind closed doors, but the people who  are involved in pork production &mdash; be it cooked ham or sausages &mdash; could not talk  &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member must ask the Minister a question.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  My question is: why were the Minister&rsquo;s officials not available to meet the  people who are involved in the pork industry? I know that some of her officials  visited abattoirs and pork produce manufacturers. Will the Minister indicate  what the initial response from those visits has been? Will the Minster explain  what scientists have told her about dioxin contamination during her discussions  with them? Has the Minister been convinced by some scientists who have said  that the pork has not been contaminated. Is she also convinced that a person  would need to eat the contaminated pork four times a day for a whole year to  become ill? Those are questions that I want answered.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I must call the Member to order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I appreciate that, Mr Deputy Speaker. I have asked my questions, and I look  forward to those being answered.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Minister, you have a choice of questions.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Go raibh maith agat. Over the weekend,  my officials were in constant contact with many organisations. As I pointed  out, NIMEA was one of those organisations. They were also in contact with  processors such as the Grampian Country Food Group and other industry bodies.  It was not possible to contact every cooked-meat producer, every retail outlet  and every butcher. However, people were contacted. It is unfortunate that  people were missed out, and I am sorry about that. However, we try to be as  accessible to everyone as we can, whether it be the weekend or not.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Officials also discussed the position with the Agri-Food and  Biosciences Institute (AFBI), but the risk to human health is an issue for FSA  scientists, and I cannot comment on that. The Member asked the same question to  the Health Minister. We have to take scientific advice, but we also have to be  seen to be responding on the basis of consumer confidence. In six months&rsquo; time,  it will be no good to say that we should have done x, y or z in December 2008.  It would be too late then, and that would dent consumer confidence in our  product. None of us was prepared to take that risk.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  There are 16 shopping days until Christmas, and everyone agrees that no stone  should be left unturned. Therefore, will the Minister explain to the House why  it is only today that the inspectors have gone on to the potentially affected  premises to remove potentially affected foodstuffs? Should the Minister not  have directed the inspectors to go on site and remove that material on Friday  or Saturday?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If that had been done, the Minister could have come to the  House today and been definitive about whether affected foodstuffs had been  used. If definitive information could not have been provided today, we might  have had it tomorrow, and we certainly would have had the information earlier  than the few days from today that the Minister mentioned in her statement. If  the inspectors had been directed to go on site on Friday or Saturday, we would  now know more than the Minister is able to tell us.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: The main action that the Department took  on Friday was to identify, and to put a restriction on, the farms and the herds  that were affected. We flagged those up with the factories, and we ensured that  those products could not get into the food chain. The action that we took on  Friday was proportionate and measured.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Since then, the meal has been sampled and tests are being  carried out. Over the weekend, we took action to try to ensure that consumer  confidence was not dented. I am not sure whether AFBI would have been in a  position to carry out testing over the weekend; that is outside of my  legislative authority. The Department acted as quickly as possible, and neither  the Department nor I were found wanting when it came to taking decisive action.  We were not aware of the position, so we could not advise the FSA, but we did  everything that we could in that regard.</p>

	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel (Mr Dodds)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That the draft Institutions of Further Education (Public  Sector Audit) Order (Northern    Ireland) 2008 be approved.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Order is intended to enable the Comptroller and Auditor  General in Northern Ireland  to become the external auditor of the institutions of further education. In  response to a number of financial issues that have arisen in further education  colleges in the past two years, the Minister for Employment and Learning has  proposed that the Comptroller and Auditor General in Northern Ireland should become the  external auditor to institutions of further education. That has been agreed in  consultation with the chairpersons of the college governing bodies and the  Northern Ireland Audit Office.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In line with the requirements of the Audit and  Accountability (Northern    Ireland) Order 2003, my Department has  sought and received the agreement of the Public Accounts Committee to the  making of the Order. The Order has been agreed by the Executive and considered  by the Committee for Finance and Personnel. No objections have been raised. The  passage of the Order will ensure that audit and accountability arrangements for  the institutions are strengthened by being subject to the public sector audit  by the Comptroller and Auditor General. I commend the Order to the Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Finance and Personnel (Mr McLaughlin)</strong>: Go raibh maith  agat. As the Minister of Finance and Personnel has explained, the draft Order  will enable the Comptroller and Auditor General to audit the accounts of the  Northern Ireland further education colleges with effect from 2007-08. The  Committee agrees that the involvement of the Comptroller and Auditor General  will strengthen accountability arrangements in the sector, providing stronger  assurances on the management, oversight, audit processes and value for money of  public expenditure.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for Finance and Personnel considered the  proposals for this subordinate legislation at its meeting on 19 November, and  subsequently was content with the policy implications of the legislation. On 26  November, the Committee gave further consideration to the Statutory Rule and  noted that the Examiner of Statutory Rules had reported no issues from his  technical scrutiny of the draft Order. At that same meeting, the Committee  unanimously agreed to recommend to the Assembly that the draft Institutions of  Further Education (Public Sector Audit) Order (Northern Ireland) 2008 be affirmed,  and I therefore support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I thank the members of the Finance and Personnel  Committee, and also those of the Public Accounts Committee, for their scrutiny  of the draft Order. If the Assembly&rsquo;s approval is given, the Order will come  into operation from 9 December.</p>

	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Will you ask the Speaker to comment,  and make a ruling tomorrow, as to whether Standing Order 18(2) can be breached  by a Member of the House?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Standing Order 18(2) states that ministerial statements  should not be reported in advance by the news media. Any breach of that  Standing Order is a gross discourtesy to the House. However, does it also apply  to Members who make statements to the media, claiming that they have spoken in  the House in debates that have not yet taken place? I refer specifically to a  press release made this evening and reported by the Press Association, claiming  that Mr O&rsquo;Loan, a Member for North Antrim, has already spoken in the debate  that we are about to have. Will you ask the Speaker to make a ruling on that  tomorrow?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I will refer your remarks to the Speaker.</p>

	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Current Economic Downturn</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I have been advised that the Executive&rsquo;s response will be provided  by the Minister of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In accordance with the Business Committee&rsquo;s agreement to  allocate additional time where two or more amendments have been selected, up to  one hour and 45 minutes will be allowed for this debate. The proposer of the  motion will have 10 minutes to propose and 10 minutes to make a winding-up  speech. Two amendments have been selected and published on the Marshalled List.  The proposer of each amendment will have 10 minutes in which to propose and  five minutes in which to make a winding-up speech. All other Members who are  called to speak will have five minutes.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly calls on the Minister of Finance and  Personnel to recognise fully the significant potential for job losses due to  the current economic downturn; to detail what assistance he can draw on from  the Treasury; and to produce urgently an action plan to assist small  businesses, especially with regard to cash flow relief, and the level of  assistance his Department can initiate locally.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members cannot behave as though we did not see the economic  downturn heading our way. That makes it all the more inexcusable that, for five  months, the two larger parties in this House squabbled over the image rights of  who blinked first on concessions. Those were five months of inactive, ineffective  government, during which the running of the Executive lay not with Ministers,  but with unelected officials. The concessions have been banked and, depending  on whom you believe, the result was not a draw. One party did better than the  other.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Going to Downing Street and returning with &pound;500 million,  much of it tied up in deferment of water charges and civil servants&rsquo; back pay &mdash;  did that register big time in the homes of families worried about the credit  crunch? Did it bring cheers of relief from the factory floor, from the builder  or from suppliers? Did it bring cheers of relief from the fisherman, the  farmer, the retailer, the wholesaler or the shopkeeper? The answer is,  unfortunately, a resounding no.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">6.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, has it done anything to instil confidence? A  couple &mdash; typical of many who are up against it in my Strangford constituency,  and, I suspect, compatible with every other constituency &mdash; recently emailed me.  They are hard-working people, who have invested in their business and created  employment for more than 25 staff. They emailed me to request urgent financial  assistance to help them to maintain and sustain their business in the current  climate. That couple said that they were receiving little or no help from the  banks, were up against a brick wall and would very much appreciate any help,  advice or assistance that I could provide.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I ask the Minister how we can help that couple. What advice  or assistance can she provide me with to pass on to them? They, in their own  words:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;are up against a brick wall.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That couple, like so many others, expects answers. It is  not good enough for the Assembly to say that we can do little about global  recessions or that the Prime Minister has said this and the Chancellor has said  that. That is not good enough when people are hurting or when yesterday&rsquo;s pound  is worth 20% less today. That is not good enough when prices are rising and  when there is unbounded uncertainty. It is businesses &mdash; particularly small  businesses &mdash; that are at risk, and they expect the Executive to be on their  side.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Do we not need to review urgently our current commitment to  public spending? Do we not need to become flexible in our ability to fund  projects across the board that will have an immediate impact, and that will  inject our local employers with confidence, thus helping them to stay in  business? Do we not need to have a long look at reprioritising the distribution  of funding in order to keep people in work and to maintain competitiveness? Is  it not irresponsible to allow those who are solvent today to slip into  insolvency tomorrow?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is difficult for a small business to find itself in the  predicament of having continuity of work &mdash; perhaps at a reduced profit but,  nevertheless, maintaining a solvent balance sheet. It is also difficult for a  small business to win an order, which will enable it to keep people in work,  only to be confronted with a &ldquo;no can do&rdquo; attitude from a bank &mdash; from the very  bosses who used the money market as their own gambling casino, while paying  themselves exorbitant salaries and bonuses.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Cash flow is crucial, but cash circulation, through wages  earned and money spent, is critical. Job losses or cutbacks could wipe out a  local community&rsquo;s economy overnight. There is a dependency on cash circulation  simply to keep businesses afloat and, therefore, important jobs in place.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr Darling, wants people  who are struggling to make ends meet and people who are out of work, with their  access to credit curtailed, if not cut off, to get out there and spend, spend,  spend. If a person is broke, how can he or she spend? He is the author of a  deferred economy, and we are meant to feel better, because he has deferred &mdash; to  another day &mdash; the hammer blow that he intends to deliver when the deferment  period expires.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must take notice, not only of Darling&rsquo;s deferments on  VAT, and so on, but of the fact that we will be paying for the cost of  water-charge deferments. When that particular burden comes, people will find it  very hard to deal with. If that is a prize, it is a booby prize, because  deferment is a booby trap. Where has all the talk of scrapping the water  charges gone? The tap tax has not been turned off. All that has occurred is a  postponement until the floodgates of water charges are opened around 2010.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Small businesses are the backbone of our economy. They  generate wages, and their entrepreneurial skills circumnavigate the risks that  they are taking. They have not relied on either handouts or massive  cash-injected bail-outs, nor do they receive employment grants extending to  thousands of pounds per job created.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In today&rsquo;s circumstances, deserved recognition of the  importance of small businesses is confronted by a culture of bureaucracy that  advises our local Ministers with dubious forecasts and inept attitudes. The  attitudes underlying the thinking of such people are not empowering, but  disempowering. They focus on what a devolved Administration cannot do or does not  have the power to do, rather than on being innovative and imaginative in the  face of this economic crisis.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Last Monday, the headline that hit the newspapers read:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;25 days to rescue our construction industry&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The article cited a letter signed by high-profile  players in the construction industry, and that letter was backed by the editors  of the &lsquo;Belfast Telegraph&rsquo;, the &lsquo;News Letter&rsquo;, &lsquo;The Irish Times&rsquo;, and &lsquo;The  Mirror&rsquo;. It called on the Executive to insure against underspend in any area  and for local firms to get a fair crack of procurement routes to departmental  spending. The article wins my full support in proclaiming that Northern Ireland needs a Northern Ireland solution for Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  needs. So what about it, Minister? With 17 days left to rescue our construction  industry, what is being done to provide a Northern   Ireland solution for Northern Ireland&rsquo;s needs?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am surprised that the Executive have not gone into  semi-permanent session given the situation that we are in. I believe that a  rewriting of the Administration&rsquo;s entire economic policy is required in order  to reflect the changed economic circumstances. Businesses are craving  leadership and a greater sense of urgency and action commensurate with the  depth and seriousness of the recession that we are in. They deserve to be told that  we can or that we cannot make a difference for them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Current circumstances are vastly different, and the idea  that the Finance Minister&rsquo;s introduction of a strategic stocktaking process has  created a financial panacea to see us through these rough times is, I am  afraid, no longer acceptable in the situation. I believe that that view is  reflected in the Committee for Finance and Personnel&rsquo;s submission on the  strategic stocktake, which the Executive have in front of them for  consideration at their next meeting.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That Finance Committee report, unanimously agreed in its  strategic considerations, highlighted the following: doubt as to the  reliability of information in departmental submissions to the stocktake, and  thus, the evidence upon which Executive decisions may be based; failure by  Departments to fully address the stocktake terms of reference in identifying  significantly increased requirements without setting out how those requirements  will be addressed; the Budget implications of not achieving previously planned  asset realisations; doubt as to the Departments&rsquo; capacity to deliver  accelerated capital expenditure in the circumstances in which they are required  to raise their standard of financial management and performance; and the need  for clarity on the departmental budgets regarding the Chancellor&rsquo;s pre-Budget  report. The Committee&rsquo;s report also highlights a general concern at the range  and quantum of new and emerging pressures on existing budget allocations that remain  to be addressed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I could almost rest my case. I have put to the Minister the  full import of what the public expects. Will the Minister to whom I tabled this  motion &mdash; he is not in the House, and I regret that, but I still make my remarks  to him &mdash; accept the realities of the consequences of the recession that  businesses are facing? Will he move to stabilise the current pressures on  business, and tell us how he is going to do that? Will he act to minimise the  impact of job losses, and tell us how? Will he encourage his Executive  colleagues to go into semi-permanent session? If he cannot do these things,  will he tell us why? I await his response.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  beg to move amendment No 1: At end insert</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;; and furthermore, to set out what steps are being taken to  accelerate investment and to re-direct resources to both boost the level of  economic activity and to re-balance the economy.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the proposers for tabling the motion for debate. It  is vital that the Assembly be fully seized of the economic downturn and, in  particular, its effects upon Northern    Ireland. We are all conscious of its effect  on households and businesses alike. It is important that we ensure that the  Executive do everything that they can to address the situation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In some respects, this debate may be the overture to the  main performance of next week&rsquo;s take-note debate on the Executive&rsquo;s action  plan. I hope that this evening&rsquo;s discussions will serve an important function  in shaping the deliberations of the Executive even at this, the eleventh hour.  I stress again that those deliberations are long overdue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to put what the Executive can and should be  doing into perspective. It is acknowledged that there is a global economic  crisis, albeit with national and regional dimensions, and that action is needed  at various governance levels.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Northern    Ireland will benefit from global actions through  the G20&rsquo;s improved co-ordination and regulation of the global economy. Monetary  action, such as the Bank of England&rsquo;s reduction of interest rates, the rescue  of the banking system, and the recent &pound;20 billion fiscal stimulus from the  British Government, will benefit the entire United   Kingdom, including Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although not necessarily agreeing with the rationale or  likely effectiveness of each of the incentives, one must acknowledge the sheer  scale of the intervention.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As a percentage of GDP, however, the relative scale of the  British Government&rsquo;s intervention is overshadowed by the interventions of other  Governments, including the possible plans of the incoming Obama administration.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive do not have access to significant tax-varying  powers or borrowing rights; nevertheless, the Executive could take action on  two broad fronts. First, they can take steps to address the situation in Northern Ireland.  However, they have not acted in a decisive, effective or timely manner.  Recently, the Alliance Party called for the introduction of a 10-day pledge for  the prompt payment of invoices by Departments and agencies. Good cash flow is  critical for businesses, particularly in the current climate. I welcome the  Finance Minister&rsquo;s decision to introduce that pledge for Northern Ireland  at the end of November. However, that was at least six weeks after the same  commitment was made by Lord Mandelson on behalf of the British Government.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">An even greater problem lies with the actions that the  British Government took at the start of September in relation to a package of  measures on fuel poverty and energy efficiency. Much of that did not directly  apply to Northern Ireland;  with devolution, we have our own responsibilities. However, three months on, Northern Ireland  is still waiting for its own package.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, the Executive can use their spending power to  make a difference. It is a matter of regret that in the current Budget,  populism was placed ahead of prudence, leaving little room for manoeuvre.  Priority is given to plugging holes rather than to investing for the common  good and for recovery.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The forthcoming Budget stocktake will be more about covering  the gaps than about shifting priorities to encourage investment to grow the  economy out of recession. If better plans had been in place, a better range of  opportunities would be available to make a difference.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive have some Barnett consequentials coming their  way and an enhanced ability to bring forward investment. The great challenge  for the Executive lies in their capital investment programme. In this economic  context, all Governments should be looking to accelerate investment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For example, the UK Government are investing a  further &pound;1 billion in social housing. The question in Northern Ireland  is whether this year&rsquo;s capital Budget will even be spent; we have a damaging  culture of underspend. This year, some Departments, notably Health and Education,  are dragging their feet over investment delivery plans. Reaching the end of  March with considerable capital underspend would signify a massive failure  across Government.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The challenge is to rebalance and modernise the economy to  be better prepared for recovery and to take full advantage of new  opportunities.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">6.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There must be no complacency about the problem that is  posed by the relative size of the public sector in Northern Ireland &mdash; it is a major  structural weakness. In the short term, however, that may ensure that the  recession in Northern Ireland  is not quite as deep as in other parts of the UK  or in the Republic   of Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I fear that the structural weaknesses in Northern Ireland  and its poor performance in investing for recovery will mean that the recession  lasts longer. The onset of recession must embolden and accelerate efforts to  deliver economic change. However, at present, there is no overarching economic  strategy for Northern    Ireland beyond the loose framework within  the Programme for Government. The process of putting in place a regional  economic strategy has stalled and may even be downgraded.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is a particular question about which sectors are  potential targets for growth. I am thinking about the potential for following  the example of other nations in seeking to invest in the green economy. The  potential of the &ldquo;green new deal&rdquo; in the United States is an example. There  are also works such as &lsquo;Hot, Flat and Crowded&rsquo; by Thomas L Friedman that give  wider popular recognition of opportunities offered by the green economy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I had the opportunity, by coincidence, to raise the issue  of the green economy with two DUP Ministers last Monday. The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment,  Arlene Foster, who is in the House this evening, said:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;There are tremendous opportunities for us in  manufacturing, research and development and innovation. In fact, we could be  leaders in the green economy in all those areas&rdquo;. &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official Report, Vol 35,  No 7, p309, col 2].</span></span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That was a very positive statement. However, later  that same afternoon, the Minister of the Environment, Sammy Wilson, said:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;That is a bit like saying that, if one broke all the  windows in one&rsquo;s house and spent money replacing them, there would be some sort  of net benefit to the economy, because one would have bought all that glass.  One would be no better off; one would still have window panes but would have  spent money on them.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official Report, Vol 35, No 7, p344, col 1].</span></span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">He went on to call that &ldquo;voodoo economics&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I suggest that the Minister of the Environment does not  seem to grasp the economic logic of replacing single-pane windows with double  glazing. Members are used to hearing contradictory messages from different parties  on the Executive, but those statements constitute a major difference between  two DUP Ministers. I hope that the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment clarifies  the Executive&rsquo;s position in that regard.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am critical of many aspects of the UK&rsquo;s fiscal  stimulus efforts, including its failure to invest sufficiently in the green  economy. It is, nevertheless, worth recognising that the UK is set to  spend another &pound;535 million on that green economy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party agrees with the sentiments of the UUP/Conservative  Party motion; it certainly notes that the UUP has been a little more  interventionist in its approach than its Conservative partners have been at Westminster. I hope that  that is not the first split in their marriage. The purpose of the Alliance  Party amendment is to take the very welcome motion a little further.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My party&rsquo;s amendment adds two important points. First, the  Executive must not only ensure that the current capital budgets are spent, but  resources should be shifted in order to accelerate investment. Secondly, the  amendment argues that measures to address the downturn, plan for recovery and  restructure the economy must go hand in hand; they reinforce each other and  must be carried through at the same time.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We can also support the SDLP amendment, because the two are  not mutually exclusive; they complement each other. In particular, the SDLP  amendment goes into greater detail on immediate steps that might be taken in  relation to capital spending and the construction industry. The issue of prompt  payments, of course, has been addressed by the Executive.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, the debate is at a late hour in what has  been a busy day for the Assembly. However, it is important that a collective,  positive and strong message is sent out that all Members are taking the issue  of the economic downturn extremely seriously. I am conscious of the effects  that it is having on my constituents and the business people whom I represent.  I am sure that every Member could say the same thing. The response of the Executive  has not been strong enough to date. I hope that that situation will be  rectified in the weeks to come.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  beg to move amendment No 2: At end insert</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;; and further calls on the Executive to commit all  Departments and public bodies to making prompt payments to suppliers, within  ten days at the latest; expedite their capital investment programme; make  representations to Treasury for further measures to stimulate the economy; and  exert influence on banks and Revenue and Customs to show proper consideration,  support and sensitivity for local businesses and their workforces.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion and the Alliance Party amendment, and  I believe the SDLP amendment adds to the motion in a useful way. It is  important for the Assembly to react in an appropriate way. Not just now, but  for some time to come, the news on the economic front is not going to be good.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Serious commentators suggest that 2009 will be more difficult  &mdash; perhaps considerably more so &mdash; than matters are at present. The Assembly  cannot debate every piece of bad news, but there is a need for it to say  meaningful things in a strategic manner at crucial moments. The present can be  regarded as one such moment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I listened to the words of incoming US President, Barack  Obama, at the weekend. He said that the situation will get worse before it gets  better. He also said that there is a need to jumpstart the economy, not only  for the short term, but for the long term, in order to achieve sustainable  economic growth. The same message applies to Northern Ireland. This is not the  occasion or the time for easy rhetoric &mdash; it is the time to show that the  Assembly is a serious place where meaningful things are said.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The news on jobs is certainly not good. There is a  significant loss of confidence in many sectors. Retail has been affected badly.  Above all, there have been dramatic job losses in house construction. I had  hoped to say that the story on manufacturing is somewhat better; however,  today, I heard the news that there is a noticeable downturn in that sector.  That should not blind us to the fact that the manufacturing sector has, in  recent years, increased its output well ahead of the UK rate. Although Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  manufacturing base is, indeed, too small, it is solid and must be built upon.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to express my support for Northern Ireland  Manufacturing and to congratulate it on its new name and new policy document  &lsquo;Manufacturing Counts&rsquo;. It is an important body, with some 500 members. I  support its call for a new concordat between manufacturers and Government. I  welcome its initiative with the Carbon Trust to save energy in production and  to develop new products in the green sector. I welcome what it calls its &ldquo;4  Cs&rdquo;, particularly its reference to:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;changing our Culture by changing our own view of our  potential.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">It is absolutely true that many barriers to success  are inside our own heads.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Enterprise Minister to the debate and I  appreciate her attendance. I welcome her development of a blueprint on further  exploitation of science and R&amp;D capabilities. I also welcome her  independent review of economic development policy. If I have any question on  that, it is, perhaps, why it did not come into being sooner.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That will feed into the Department of Finance and  Personnel&rsquo;s (DFP) revised regional economic strategy. I note that, this week,  it will tell the Committee about its plans for a replacement paper for delivery  of economic growth in Northern    Ireland. I have noted the reference to  action by both the Finance Minister and the Enterprise Minister. After 18  months, people want to see action.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As for construction, there are clear indications of serious  trouble in Government procurement. Delivery plans in health and education have  been delayed. Work on 28 new schools is seriously behind schedule, and so, too,  is the maintenance programme. Money that has already been agreed has not come  through. The Assembly ought to be as shocked as I am that no less than 42% of  all departmental capital spend is scheduled for the last three months of the  current financial year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are two significant issues with that: first, far from  capital spend being brought forward, which is what everyone has called for to  deal with the crisis in construction, that capital spend has been delayed.  Secondly, as Stephen Farry has mentioned, there is now serious danger of  underspend, and that money will disappear into an end-year flexibility black  hole, from which it may or may not return.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I draw the conclusion that there are serious problems with  the procurement system. It is not surprising that the Committee for Finance and  Personnel is conducting an inquiry into public procurement. Legal findings  against DFP and the Department of Education indicate those concerns. There are  serious questions about the framework approach &mdash; for example, what opportunity  does it give small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)? Reform of procurement  must make it less bureaucratic and more open to SMEs.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">What use is the power to bring forward spend? The Assembly  has been permitted to bring forward &pound;86 million of spend from future years. I  support that. However, what use is that provision if, at present, the Assembly  cannot spend the money in the current year&rsquo;s Budget? That is the situation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to discuss action that has been taken by banks. I  support the remarks of the Federation of Small Businesses in that regard. I  regret a point that has been made elsewhere that local banks have not come  forward themselves, nor rapidly enough, to speak to the Finance Committee.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The banks have been recapitalised by Government, but that  money must get to the businesses that want it. The Government must either make  the banks do that or take them over. People in higher places than me &mdash; or,  indeed, anyone in the Assembly &mdash; have made that point. The base-rate cuts must  be passed on to businesses fully and at once. Rates of interest should be based  on the Bank of England base rate rather than the &mdash; London interbank offered  rate &mdash; LIBOR rate, which is a higher rate that changes weekly and gives no  confidence or certainty to businesses to allow them to plan.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly and the banks must support businesses that  have cash-flow problems due to unpaid bills. The SDLP amendment includes an  instruction to public bodies to pay bills within 10 days. Stephen Farry  mentioned that that had already been implemented, but we added the reference to  public bodies and Departments. The small business finance scheme &mdash; which was  introduced by the Chancellor in the pre-Budget statement &mdash; was designed to  guarantee loans. Local businesses need clarity on how that scheme will operate  here.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I look forward to the introduction of a small business  relief scheme. A scheme such as the one that is in operation in Wales would  cost only &pound;6 million, and it would be a big psychological boost for small  business. The rating of vacant business premises was brought in not long ago,  when times were good. It was introduced to encourage the productive use of  resources &mdash; a perfectly good reason. However, it has now become a significant  burden on many businesses who cannot dispose of their property through lease or  sale. I ask for that significant issue to be reviewed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I also make a proposal in respect of social housing. The  Minister for Social Development made particular reference to the proposal when  answering several questions during today&rsquo;s Question Time. This is not special  pleading on behalf of DSD, and I would be only too happy for the Executive to  take collective credit. The proposal is simply for substantially more money to  be provided for social housing. For example, social housing could be promised  first call in future monitoring rounds. If further dedicated funds could be  obtained for social housing, so much the better</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is no measure that would give more help to our  house-building sector, and it would also help to solve a huge social problem.  It is the single initiative that comes to mind by which money could be injected  into the system quickly. It would have a dramatic impact on unemployment and the  crisis facing the construction industry. It is the single most tangible thing  that the Assembly could do, and it would be a useful outcome of the debate.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: The  DUP supports Dr Farry&rsquo;s reference to sending out a collective message of  recognition about the seriousness of the economic downturn. The DUP is also  happy to support the amendments that have been tabled by the Alliance Party and  the SDLP, and the initial motion that was proposed by the Conservative/Ulster  Unionist Party.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Unionist Party spent much of the weekend  castigating the DUP as being the &ldquo;little Ulster&rdquo; party. Therefore, I was  somewhat taken aback when the proposer of the motion seemed to advocate some  sort of economic Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI), where everything  has to be within the prism of Northern Ireland. There must be recognition that  the economic downturn is a global situation. What we do locally has to  complement national policy and global economics.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The proposer of the motion showed much more of the true  spirit of Conservative commitment when he seemed to distance himself from his  Executive colleagues by deriding the securing of &pound;900 million from the Treasury  and the deferment of water charges. Perhaps, the proposer of the motion would  have preferred for that money to have been cast back to the Treasury, for &pound;900  million worth of cuts to have been made, and for water charges to have been  imposed. That seems to be the logic of his position.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The proposer of the Alliance Party&rsquo;s amendment indicated  that we are part of a global situation. The FSB and others have highlighted the  problems in respect of local banks.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Issues such as the difficulty in obtaining additional  lending, problems with withdrawing overdrafts, the imposition of exorbitant  charges, some banks&rsquo; uncooperative attitudes, and the cancellation of business  Visa cards are, perhaps, reasons why banks are, as Mr O&rsquo;Loan mentioned,  reluctant to subject themselves to scrutiny. Indeed, the banks seem to be, at  best, stand-offish. Given the level of public investment in banks &mdash;  particularly from national Government &mdash; banks cannot expect, on one hand, to be  bailed out while, on the other hand, they make life difficult for SMEs.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">7.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I share other Members&rsquo; reservations about some of the  economic packages that have been established by national Government. It would  be churlish of the Assembly not to realise that the pre-Budget report included  several measures that should benefit SMEs, including more generous tax relief  for businesses that are experiencing losses by allowing additional carry-back  of up to &pound;50,000 of losses to be set against taxable profits from the previous  three years. Other measures include HM Revenue and Customs business payment  support service &mdash; which will allow tax bills to be spread &mdash; and the new  small-business finance scheme. All those measures are welcome and will benefit  businesses in Northern    Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the context of the global economy and national policy,  we must investigate how to increase additional value. Although some action has  already been taken, the Executive will introduce more initiatives. It was  important to send out a signal about prompt payments, and the Minister of  Finance and Personnel, Nigel Dodds, made an announcement on ensuring, from a  Government point of view, that payment was made to businesses to ensure that  credit did not accrue. That practical measure can be established.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment will  roll out a roadshow to deal with the credit crunch in Northern Ireland;  it will extend beyond Invest NI companies and will benefit the small-business  sector. All Members will acknowledge that the small-business sector is the  backbone of the economy in Northern    Ireland, and we must ensure that we do not  over-regulate, over-bureaucratise or overtax it. There have been moves in the  right direction on that issue. The Assembly&rsquo;s initial Budget focused on  providing regional financial support. There will be challenges in the future,  but with the goodwill and co-operation of all parties in the Executive &mdash; and  those outside it &mdash; the Assembly can encourage businesses to focus and can  provide support during difficult times.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Sinn F&eacute;in supports the motion and  is content with both amendments, which add value to it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion anticipates or pre-empts &mdash; and that was perhaps  the original intention &mdash; the Executive response, but I am sure that the  Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment will consider that in her  response. Members have said that businesses and the Assembly are experiencing  communication problems with the four main banks. The banks must declare what  practical measures they are prepared to consider to help businesses and the  local economy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although the regulation of banks and the response to those  broad policies are not transferred matters, the Assembly is concerned about  that issue. However, we must address issues such as the passing on of base-rate  cuts to mortgage clients, the costs of loans and overdrafts, the level of fees  and charges, the calling in of loans to business, and mortgage difficulties and  repossessions, which have, inevitably, arisen.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that the banks will clarify any additional steps  that they are prepared to consider, because it is important to tease out the extent  to which businesses and customers are benefiting from the measures that  Alistair Darling and the Treasury announced.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For example, there is emerging evidence that banks are  compensating themselves for any reduction in interest rates by simultaneously increasing  loan and mortgage arrangement fees. That is an issue about which the Assembly  would have particular concern.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the attendance of the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment. There has been reference, particularly from Declan O&rsquo;Loan, to the  issue of underspend. I have welcomed and supported the consistent commentary of  the First Minister and the Minister of Finance and Personnel on that issue,  warning Departments of the reaction that there would be, at this time of  economic downturn, if declarations are made so late that the Executive would  have no opportunity to respond, or bring forward re-allocation or  re-prioritisation proposals.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Given the track record &mdash; which, unfortunately, shows a  history of late declarations and underspend on an annual basis, and which is  often thrown back in our face by the Treasury when Ministers are attempting to  negotiate support and relief measures for the work of the Executive and its  Departments &mdash; I ask that the Executive consider contingency arrangements. There  is a need to have a prudent position in relation to late declarations, as well  as applying, quite properly, the oversight and accountability to warn  Departments that that is an issue which the public will &mdash; rightly &mdash; criticise  if it emerges that money is, in effect, being handed back to the centre. We  have been told that there will be much more restricted access in the current  circumstances to the end-year flexibility.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, it must be recognised that the Executive is  very limited indeed in its ability to respond to the economic crisis. Perhaps  all of the parties in the Assembly could consider revisiting the proposition  that we should, perhaps, seek more powers over fiscal issues, which would allow  us to develop the home-grown solutions that the situation demands. Go raibh  maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  I welcome the debate, as I do the motion and amendments. However, I was a  little taken aback by the comments &mdash; indeed, the criticism &mdash; of the mover of  the substantive motion, when he seemed to suggest that the Executive did not  foresee the economic crisis. The fact of the matter is that the Bank of England  did not foresee the economic crisis, and nor did the Chancellor of the  Exchequer or the Prime Minister. I do not know how the Member thinks the Executive  in Northern Ireland  would be given extra gifts and powers to foretell what was going to happen.  This House should be interested in how we react to the crisis, and deal with  it, in order to get Ulster out of the economic downturn that is, unfortunately,  upon us.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion, rightly, calls for the production of an action  plan. There is an action plan: it is the Programme for Government and the  investment strategy for Northern Ireland, in which there are numerous  milestones identified, which could &mdash; if people, and this House, put their  shoulder to the wheel &mdash; be delivered, thus making significant progress for all  the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In moving the second amendment, Mr O&rsquo;Loan warned about  underspend. That warning is correct, and will probably be most critical for the  Department for Social Development, where there appear to have been huge  problems with mismanagement of land sales. The house sales-scheme &mdash; which has  been consulted on since February of this year &mdash; is now in place, and does not appear  to have been taken up with the drive and momentum that is required to make it  work. That Department needs to move from foot-dragging on house sales, and get  on with a measure that will work.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">How can significant progress take place? My colleague the  Member for North Down Peter Weir was  right to identify the banks. That is where we have to see some movement. The  latest statement from the British Bankers&rsquo; Association (BBA) explains that  recession may turn to depression. We have moved from boom to depression with no  discernable period of recession in between. We must take stock of what stage  the recession is at before we start talking it down even further into an  economic depression. The banks have some responsibility for that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">This House and the banks must create consumer confidence.  Businesses have to be encouraged that there is confidence, otherwise the  34-year low in house sales will continue to be driven into an economic  depression. The media have a responsibility for that and this House has a  responsibility for building &mdash; not busting &mdash; economic confidence. The woe is me  stuff that we often get from some politicians and media circles must cease,  otherwise this crisis will become a depression.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are some very identifiable measures. Mr O&rsquo;Loan  identified the derating of vacant business property. I wish that that proposal  would have been included in the amendment. The Executive have also identified  &pound;3 billion of capital spend to urgently release planning approvals. The Department  has &pound;2 billion worth of planning approvals for Belfast alone, which I hope are released  urgently. Fast-tracking the investment strategy for Northern Ireland could help to ramp  up investment in social housing so that the Minister for Social Development can  meet the need of 5,000 social homes as urgently as possible.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Most importantly, the banks should be encouraged to lend  money to the public. It is ridiculous that banks have not made themselves  available to the Finance Committee. That should have happened, and I hope that  that happens urgently because banks are practically civil servants who are  holding our money. They are only able to function because they have a  subvention from the Government.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member should draw his remarks to a close.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  They must urgently make that money available to the public and help the world  of commerce go round.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat. I welcome the opportunity to take part in this very  timely debate. During the current economic downturn, it is clear that there has  been a rise in unemployment, a rise in economic inactivity and a sharp decline  in the housing market, which has led to devastating effects in the construction  sector and a huge rise in fuel prices and the cost of living. It is painful for  people to lose jobs at any time, but it is much worse when fuel prices are  higher, borrowing is curtailed and the cost of living in general means that an  average family has to find at least &pound;29 more each week than they did this time  last year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Businesses have also been hit. Employee levels have  decreased as more people are paid off because of an overall downward trend in  business turnovers. In addition, company liquidation has increased by 50% when  compared to statistics this time last year. There is a total lack of consumer  confidence, which is evident in the downturn as people are buying fewer items  for the home and are not replacing items such as cars and other family items.  The construction industry has been one of the worst hit as a result of a  decline in the housing market. Unemployment in the industry is currently at its  peak. Some from the sector have forecast a loss of 10,000 jobs by March next  year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My colleague Mitchel McLaughlin commented on some of the  initiatives that could be taken by the British Government. I will concentrate  on what I feel that the Executive could do here to offset some of the  unemployment difficulties that are associated with the current economic  downturn and, in particular, to support smaller businesses. As has already been  mentioned by several people, it is imperative that the British Government and  local Ministers challenge banks and other lending institutions about their  current lending practices.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The recent injection of public money in order to steady the  banks has not cascaded down to local businesses or customers. Furthermore,  although some banks are now under public ownership and many others are being  supported by millions of pounds of public money, money is still not readily  available for business or ordinary consumers, who are facing new mortgage  arrangements that will put them further into debt.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">7.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Banks are still charging high rates of interest for  borrowing, and are calling in credit from businesses that simply do not have  the necessary cash flow to cope. Consequently, many of those businesses are  being forced to close or to go into receivership. The present circumstances  also affect retail giants such as Woolworths, which recently had to close,  causing more unemployment &mdash; it is becoming a vicious circle. Banks have a  social responsibility, and they must pass the good will that they received on  to businesses and customers.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  I do not have much time, and I have a lot to say.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The way in which the Executive deliver the investment  strategy and the Programme for Government could also help to offset the social  and financial difficulties caused by the economic downturn. The Executive have  already set out their commitment to maximise social and employment opportunities  for everyone through the public-procurement process, which, although an  essential part of the investment strategy, is even more important now. We must  grasp that opportunity to secure jobs and create employment opportunities.  Almost &pound;20 billion has been earmarked by the Executive over the next 10 years  for the public procurement of works, services and goods. Considering the  all-island context, almost &euro;16 billion is spent on public procurement each  year, and most of that goes to overseas companies.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) account for a  large percentage of businesses in the North, yet almost three quarters of them,  including those from the social-economy sector, do not even apply for  public-procurement contracts because they think that the tendering process is  stacked against them and firmly weighted in favour of larger companies, most of  which are from overseas.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">By working closely with organisations such as InterTradeIreland,  Invest NI, the IDA (Industrial Development Agency) and the enterprise councils,  North and South, we have an excellent opportunity to develop SMEs on this  island and to encourage them to secure contracts through public procurement.  Businesses in the North should have the equal access to public-procurement contracts  in the South and, likewise, those based in the South should have access to  contracts in the North. As things stand, because of the way in which  procurement process is weighted in favour of larger companies, SMEs do not have  equal access to either market.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Planning is another area that could be developed in order  to create employment opportunities. Last month, it was estimated that  approximately seven planning applications for large-scale investment proposals  were sitting in the planning system. For example, the John Lewis site at  Sprucefield, which does not even require public money, has been held up at the  planning stage for long periods &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member should bring her remarks to a close, please.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  I have not nearly finished. Although the debate is focused on offsetting job  losses &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  It is important that we also recognise that many people have already lost their  jobs, and many more are living with the uncertainty of knowing where to find  money for food or to keep warm. That, too, is a responsibility &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Newton</strong>:  Like my party colleagues, I support the motion and both amendments. In  addition, I wish to express my disappointment with Mr McNarry&rsquo;s attitude when  proposing the motion. The present circumstances are not, as Mr McNarry alluded,  the fault of the Executive, and, even if they were, he would be criticising two  of his colleagues, who are members of the Executive. If Members are to help in  any way during this economic downturn, the House must work on solutions  together.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Nonetheless, I welcome the motion, because it gives Members  an opportunity to put on record their recognition and concern for the business  community during these difficult days.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to express my support for the 10-day pledge that was  outlined by Minister Dodds. It is right that councils and Government bodies  have remits to promote business, and it makes little sense to spend taxpayers  and ratepayers&rsquo; money encouraging businesses, while potentially creating  cash-flow problems as a result of invoices not being paid by at least the due  date. The 10-day pay pledge is an initiative that the entire business community  will welcome, and it should be extended to all statutory agencies.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Northern    Ireland has a small-business economy.  Therefore, we should all be concerned when small businesses are being damaged  in the current economic downturn; it affects every single one of us. More than  95% of our private sector comprises small businesses. A loss of confidence in  that sector and in its ability to trade will have a most negative impact.  Declan O&rsquo;Loan was right to make that point.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have met many businesspeople in my constituency and  beyond &mdash; manufacturers, service providers, new start-ups and long-established,  particularly family, firms &mdash; and they all have one thing in common: the need  for steady cash flow in order to continue trading. Companies do not always go  out of business because of a lack of orders; they frequently suffer a cash-flow  problem.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to turn criticism of the Executive on its head. In  particular, I wish to mention, without dwelling on them, three initiatives that  Minister Foster has supported. First, the Northern Ireland Manufacturing Focus  Group, which has already been mentioned, will be a viable and important  initiative for the manufacturing sector.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, the Matrix initiative, which the Minister  launched a few days ago &mdash; and which Stephen Farry did not name, although he  indicated the importance of research and development and higher-value-added  products &mdash; will be an important initiative as Northern Ireland develops over  the next few years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Thirdly, the importance of the Invest Northern Ireland  initiative to stretch out to organisations beyond its current client base  cannot be overestimated. I ask the Minister, in her ongoing review of Invest  Northern Ireland, to  consider that initiative further as an integral part of Invest Northern Ireland in the  future.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">At the heart of the matter, as has already been mentioned,  is the need for a positive relationship between the banks and SMEs in  particular. Like other Members, I have heard less-than-encouraging words about  that relationship from the SME sector. I have been told of banks refusing  credit to very good, solid businesses when they almost expected those same  businesses to extend their credit during the good times of not so long ago. We  need to ensure, whether it is done via the Executive or the Minister of Finance  and Personnel, that the banks start to step up to the mark and take up their  responsibilities. As one businessman said to me, in short, the banks proved to  be poor partners to SMEs in Northern    Ireland when the going got tough.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I understand that many of the measures that will be of help  to small businesses have already been announced in the 2008 pre-Budget report  and will be implemented by the Treasury. I would be grateful if the Minister would  confirm that that is also the intention in Northern Ireland &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Newton</strong>:  Will the Minister reassure Members that we will be working with the banks to  ensure that small businesses are sufficiently aware of their options?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: The  current economic turmoil arouses much anxiety and concern among the public, the  business sector and the policy-making community. Eventually, the economy will  recover and, I hope, resume sustained growth, but we must take urgent action  now to ensure that the recession will be short-lived and that growth will take  off from as high a base as possible.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive must fast-track capital expenditure projects  such as roads, hospitals and schools. The Minister of Finance and Personnel has  stated that some &pound;86&middot;5 million is available for capital spend during the next  two years. What is the current situation in respect of those projects, and how  much can be redirected towards social housing, which would help to offset the  collapse in the private housing sector? Any easements in the December  monitoring round must be utilised for further projects that will help to  kick-start the economy rather than to plug some hole in the Executive&rsquo;s Budget.  It would be most unfortunate should there be a large capital spend left in the  Budget at the end of this financial year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is essential that our best efforts are used to keep  people in work and to sustain businesses through this difficult period. The VAT  concession from the Chancellor is a step in the right direction, but it is much  too small a step. He should be considering a VAT holiday to encourage the  public to spend and to permit businesses to invest. National Insurance rates  should be reduced for a period to assist in the regeneration of the economy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The banks have come in for justified criticism for the part  that they have played in the financial crisis, and several Members mentioned  that. Banks must realise that it is crucial that they free up loans in order to  improve the liquidity of business and assist their cash flow. The European  Investment Bank also has a role to play in that regard.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The banks should be encouraged to delay house  repossessions. Instead, they should consider renting the properties back to the  mortgagees until the economy recovers. At that stage, the normal business  operation could be continued.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive should develop a recovery plan to create  jobs, to sustain jobs and to improve cash flow and liquidity for small- and  medium-sized enterprises. The Executive, with the Strategic Investment Board,  should recognise that economic growth necessitates continued entrepreneurial  innovation. Much more needs to be done in that area, and we need to develop  better ways to quantify innovation in the marketplace. We need to create a stronger  framework for identifying and measuring innovation in our economy and its  impact on the economy. Furthermore, we need to discuss innovation drivers,  impediments and enablers. We need, dare I say it, improvements in our education  system so that entrepreneurship is encouraged from primary school to third  level.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The planning and regulatory environment must be proactive  in its dealings with individuals and businesses. Several Members commented on  the Planning Service. Energy costs remain a major impediment to business and  industry. We must continue to scrutinise those costs to ensure that they are as  low as possible, and we must continue to promote energy efficiency and develop  a strong energy policy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Our high expectations on new foreign direct investment may  not now be realised. As a result, Invest Northern Ireland&rsquo;s budget will need to be  refocused on the support for existing businesses. Much more can be done to  develop our tourism economy. The signature project at Titanic Quarter is  welcome, but there are many other opportunities that could be exploited.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The previous Finance Minister made much of the need to  improve the performance and delivery of our Government Departments. He took the  responsibility upon himself and initiated the performance and efficiency delivery  unit to ensure that Departments were delivering their spending plans on time  and getting the best value for money for those spends. More than ever, we need  to ensure that that is happening and that the people and businesses of Northern Ireland  are in the best position to ride out the current economic storm.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I welcome the opportunity to speak  in this important debate. It gives Members an opportunity to articulate their  concerns, and I will articulate the concerns of the people whom I represent in  West Tyrone.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Paisley Jnr said that nobody knew that the current  downturn in the economy was going to happen. However, Strabane District  Council, of which I am a member &mdash; and I declare that interest &mdash; commissioned a  short report, with the assistance of Oxford Economics, in the summer, when the  state of the construction industry in my area became obvious. We were presented  with the report in August 2008, and I hope to quote from it later in my contribution,  because it is important that we make the connection between this place and  other places.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">One Member mentioned the important role that councils can  play in the current situation. Council officers, particularly those who deal  with economic development, have a role to play in feeding information to the  Assembly. It would be worthwhile for the relevant Member here to have that type  of contact with local councils.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The paper that was commissioned by Strabane District  Council was about deconstructing growth. It deals with the construction  industry over the past 10 years, but focuses on the years 2008 to 2012. The  paper paints a picture of what will happen in my area of West Tyrone generally,  but specifically in Strabane and the surrounding area.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">7.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The figures come with a caveat, as they were forecast at a  time when we were not in a recession. Things were beginning to slow down, but  not to the extent that they are now. The paper states that 250 jobs will be  lost in Strabane over the next two years in the base case, and that in a  recession &mdash; where we are now &mdash; around 560 will be lost. The paper also refers  to what it terms the second-round effect of losing jobs, when 280 will be lost,  which, in a worst-case scenario, makes a total of 840 job losses.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The paper goes on to detail how much money the local  economy will lose. In the best-case scenario, it will be &pound;1&middot;5 million, and that  figure will be multiplied in the worst-case scenario. The west already has an  issue with investment &mdash; and I will comment on that &mdash; but losing any jobs will  have a serious effect.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A Member referred to Invest NI. I saw in the press that  Mike Smyth from the University   of Ulster said recently  that there should be a re-profiling of what Invest NI does, and I agree with  him. A review of Invest NI has already been mentioned.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I do not have the date of the paper; however, it is fairly  current. I am quoting figures from the paper and, as with all figures &mdash; no  matter where they come from &mdash; they can be challenged. It says that Strabane  receives one fifth of the Northern    Ireland average amount of investment. Over  three years, that will work out as a deficit of &pound;11 million, which is quite a  bit. Apparently, Omagh receives half of the Invest NI budget &mdash; if the figures  are correct. The people in my area would agree. Locally, the Invest NI office  in Omagh does what it can within its parameters, and those parameters are a  constraint. I support taking a good look at what is happening in Invest NI.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">One local small businessman spoke to me this week about the  difficulties that he Is experiencing with the Planning Service. The Executive  have introduced several measures, but there are things that we could do now. We  must look at big projects for Strabane town. I was delighted to hear the  Minister for Social Development being so enthusiastic about what could be built  on the Lisanelly site in Omagh. I hope that all the other parties will row in  behind and do whatever they can to put the so-called education village on the  Lisanelly site.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the debate and commend the Executive for what  they have done so far. They have more to do. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  At the outset, I will try to make a positive contribution to the debate, which  may seem a contradiction to the motion. However, we must send out the positive  message to all those young people who are either at, or considering going to,  university or further education colleges, that the situation will get better.  We must encourage them to live and work in Northern Ireland as we require  their skills, and they must bear with us during this difficult period and help  us to be ready for the upturn when it comes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I deal with the consequences of the economic downturn daily  through my constituency office, as, I am sure, do most Members. Some people  have already lost their jobs and others are waiting for decisions about jobs.  However, as the political leadership of Northern Ireland, we must not only  deal with the reality of the situation, but plan for the future. I have no  doubt that the Minister has that planning well under way. It is true that the  Minister is seen as the figurehead in the debate but, in reality, every  Minister has his or her part to play in preparing Northern Ireland for the good  times.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That could be achieved by continuing to promote Northern Ireland  abroad. I have been pleased to assure people in my constituency of the  dedication of the Minister of Enterprise, Trade  and Investment and of the Minister of Finance of Personnel, both of whom have  taken a keen personal interest in the problems of East   Londonderry. For that, I thank them sincerely.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister for Employment and Learning has a part to  play, and he has taken a very positive step by securing places in further  education colleges for apprentices who have been made redundant. I congratulate  the Minister on securing that vital part of our job skills base.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">All Ministers can aid the employment situation by considering  whether they can secure capital expenditure and construction industry jobs. The  Titanic development is a prime example of how that can be done. I urge large  firms to make prompt payment to subcontractors, where possible, to ensure that  they survive the downturn. Such a project will aid many firms and help to  stabilise those smaller firms that supply the major contractors. That will  greatly aid cash flow and is an example of how DFP can initiate growth locally.  The employment generated will put money in people&rsquo;s pockets, and although  higher energy bills will mean that people might not have the same disposable  income, they will still be able to spend money in local shops and aid cash flow  at a local level.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome this important motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I wondered whether I should stay to take part in this debate, given that it is  late in the day and that many Members have already made up their mind about the  way forward. I declare an interest: I worked for the Northern Ireland  Manufacturing Focus Group, and I am a director of a telecommunications company.  I have quite extensive interests in industry.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is interesting to hear solicitors talking about the  economy, about which they know little, apart from how they make their turn &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  No, I do not think that I will, because you have been a bit cheeky.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  The Member is a barrister; there is a difference.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  In the real world, nobody cares. All we know is that you are fat cats; you take  money for doing very little, apart from putting us out of business. However,  that is not personal.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">People have a go at the banks and ask why they will not  lend more. However, the real problem &mdash; and Members heard it here first &mdash; is  that banks have not yet declared their real liabilities for sub-prime lending.  There is more bad news to emerge. The real issue is that as a result of lending  to developers, banks have massive liabilities that they have not yet declared.  If there was an accountant in the Chamber, he or she would talk about the  European standards for accountancy that do not even let banks make provision  for that yet.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Why will the banks not lend money? The answer is that they  are in a hole that is much bigger than we yet realise. What can the Assembly  do? Fundamentally, it is a matter of reducing costs and attracting high-value  industry. I want the Assembly to take action rather than tinker at the margins.  I have listened as the housing market was described as an engine for the  future. It was simply not sustainable to have growth of 20% &mdash; which is what was  happening in the housing market &mdash; when real wage increases were only 2% or 3%.  That is not the way forward. The future lies in real long-term investment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am disappointed that Ian Paisley Jnr is no longer in the  Chamber. He waved the Programme for Government around and said that it was all  in that document; he told us that the plan is OK and that if we follow it, we  will be all right. What utter tripe and meaningless drivel. What is needed is a  step change. Mr Weir may intervene now if he wishes.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: The  Member is very critical of the Programme for Government. However, was that not the  same Programme for Government that was endorsed by his party&rsquo;s leader and his  party&rsquo;s Minister in the Executive?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Again, we hear that pathetic excuse &mdash; if it is good, we did it; if it is bad,  your party was part of it, too. The position has changed. I maintain my  position, Mr Weir, that what is needed is a step change in how the Assembly  deals with the economy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">What went on before is not enough &mdash; relying on the old ways  to make a living is not enough. We need someone to come along and say, for  example, that we should run fibre optics to every house in the country &mdash; I have  already declared an interest in that. We should be building infrastructure. If  the Member for West Tyrone Claire McGill is concerned about investment in  Strabane, we should build a railway or a road there so that it is viable to  invest there and in similar areas. We must try to do something that will reduce  the cost of doing business and increase &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I do not get an extra minute, so the Member better be quick.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  There is a new road that goes past Strabane &mdash; the A5.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Then the investment can be made elsewhere.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">What are the real issues in relation to the Official  Journal of the European Union? All our public procurements are bundled into big  issues, because that is easy for the Civil Service to manage, and it easy for  us to say that we have conformed to the regulations. Why do we not do a bit of  work and try to break those procurements down into small parcels of business  that our existing small and medium-sized enterprises can compete for? A firm in  my constituency has just lost a &pound;40,000 contract because the University of Ulster  decided not to tender it and gave it to a company in Wales. Who is the vice-chancellor  of that august organisation? It is the person whom we will ask to lead the way  out of this. We must think about the situation again.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The real solution is making speedy and nimble decisions and  sorting out the planning process. If I were not here, I could be at the  planning committee of Lisburn City Council trying to find a way to get the John  Lewis proposal approved. Why is that being stopped? Why can we not find someone  to make those decisions?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">One year from now, will we look back, slap ourselves on the  back and congratulate ourselves for doing a good job and fixing the problem? I  wonder.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment (Mrs Foster)</strong>: I thank the proposers of the motion for securing  the debate at a very important time for the economy. Some important issues, and  some not so important, have been raised, all of which I will try to address.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">This is the first time that all the G7 countries have been  in recession at the same time, which provides us with a particular set of  circumstances that we have not had to face before. In the past, when one of the  G7 countries was in recession, another was not, so it was able to trade its way  out of recession. The Bank of England has confirmed that the UK economy is  officially in recession. The Republic  of Ireland and the wider EU are in  recession, and output in the United    States is falling. Most Members appear to be  aware of the factors behind the economic downturn &mdash; others are not, but that is  no surprise.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It was stated that the Executive did not anticipate the  economic downturn, that the Programme for Government was a load of tripe and  that a step change was required. I refer the Members who made those comments to  page 27 of the Programme for Government, which states:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;FDI targets are framed in the context of the  prevailing economic conditions, in particular the predicted slowdown of the  global economy and uncertainties in the financial markets. This may have a  significant impact on the flows of FDI as companies adjust to revenue and cost  pressures. The targets will be continually tracked and monitored against  changing markets and, where appropriate, amended over the PfG period.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That was written in the first quartile of this  year, and it is clear that the Executive were taking action early and trying to  deal with what was coming down the line.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: No, I will not give way.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I recognise that businesses are looking to the Assembly and  the Executive to take the necessary steps to help with the downturn.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">7.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Stephen Farry said that this debate was a prelude to next  week, and he is absolutely right. Last Thursday, I attended an Executive  subgroup on the economy, which was chaired by the Minister of Finance and  Personnel and the Minister for Regional Development. The subgroup met in order  to consider proposals from Executive Ministers to help to deal with the credit  crunch. The full Executive will meet later today, and again on Thursday, when  Ministers plan to set out their overall response to the difficult economic  situation, which will be debated in the Assembly next Monday.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, the Executive have already taken some important  steps. Although Mr McNarry may feel that we have been off on holiday for the  past five months, the opposite is the case. For instance, we have confirmed  that domestic water charges will not be introduced in April 2009, which will  leave spending power in the hands of households and consumers. We have worked  to secure some additional resources from Her Majesty&rsquo;s Treasury in order to  alleviate immediate budgetary pressures. The full package amounts to &pound;900  million, not &pound;500 million, as Mr McNarry contended.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive are also mindful of the severe difficulties  faced by the construction industry at this time, and we are prepared to bring  forward worthwhile capital projects in 2008-09 if funding becomes available  through the surrender of reduced requirements by Departments in the December  monitoring round. Several Members have made the point that Ministers must look  to their capital underspend. As the Minister of Finance and Personnel has said  again and again, there is absolutely no point in giving up capital underspend  next year, when we cannot deal with the issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, the Minister of Finance and Personnel  announced recently that Departments have set a target of ensuring that approved  invoices are paid within 10 days, in order to help local businesses. That is  part of the motion that has already been acknowledged.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Farry also mentioned the regional economic strategy.  Work on a new strategy is progressing, and it will assess how Departments have  fared in delivering their key goals in the economy under the Programme for  Government. The new strategy will also embrace key reviews of policy delivery  in Invest NI and the Department for Employment and Learning, in order to ensure  that economic development policy is focused on all the correct areas of  delivery; that is very important.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Farry said that Northern Ireland had been worst hit  by the recession. Although we cannot underestimate the implications of the  downturn, Northern Ireland  is not over-exposed on retail compared with the rest of the UK. It has  experienced less exposure in the area of financial services, and there is  nothing to suggest that the impact of the downturn in Northern Ireland  will be deeper or last longer than in other regions.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: No.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Not &ldquo;no, thank you&rdquo;?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: No, just &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The MATRIX report identified potential areas for action. Mr  Farry made some comments about that, for which I thank him. It is a key issue  going forward. Let me be clear; the green economy was identified as a key area  for action &mdash; tidal energy; wind power, onshore or offshore; and bioenergy. The  reason for that is that we can make great strides in innovation, research and  development and manufacturing. Therefore, I have no difficulty in restating my  position and the position of the Executive on that issue. In particular, we  must have a competitive, secure and sustainable energy policy. I hope that we  will be able to produce such a policy when the ongoing review of energy policy  is completed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Declan O&rsquo;Loan mentioned manufacturing and Government  procurement. He knows well that some of the judicial reviews that have been  instigated by the construction industry have, unfortunately, led us to the  position that we are in at the moment on the issue of procurement. I agree with  Mr O&rsquo;Loan, and I regret that the banks will not appear before the Committee for  Finance and Personnel. It is a matter of deep regret that they have decided to  send a representative instead. However, as has been said on several occasions  recently, although we regulate the banks, we do not have the power, either at a  regional or national level, short of nationalisation, to force the banks to do  anything that they do not want to do.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to the comments that were made about  &lsquo;Manufacturing Counts&rsquo;, I can assure the House that the Executive remain  committed to supporting Northern Ireland&rsquo;s manufacturing base. That is clearly  demonstrated, for example, by the resources that Invest NI allocates to its  manufacturing clients, which shows that the majority of Invest NI&rsquo;s support is  targeted at its manufacturing clients, with around 56% of total assistance offered  by Invest NI going to such companies at present.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have already said that the capital underspend is  absolutely crucial. In my capacity as the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, I have also  been able to take some short-term steps. Last Thursday, in my capacity as  chairperson of the Economic Development Forum, I established a subgroup to come  up with recommendations on further steps that we can take to help businesses at  this time. The subgroup will report to me early in the new year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Invest NI has established a &pound;5 million accelerated-support  fund to offer its clients targeted support during the current economic  difficulties. Contrary to what Mr McNarry said about taking a holiday, the  first of those meetings was held on 25 September 2008. We have had six to date,  and we will hold another later this week. The accelerated-support fund has been  specifically established to remove constraints to growth and competitiveness  brought about by the current economic conditions. I am also glad to say that we  will be able to roll out that roadshow, which Mr Weir mentioned, to non-Invest  NI clients. The first of those events will be held next week in Omagh to cater  for the western area. Therefore, I hope that Mrs McGill recognises that  Strabane will be served by that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mitchel McLaughlin mentioned the banks&rsquo; increase in  arrangement fees, and I acknowledge his comments. Difficulties exist with the  banks, but I am pleased to tell the Member that the Minister of Finance and  Personnel, along with some of my senior officials, intends to meet the banks  next week to raise those issues.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Ian Paisley Jnr talked about the importance of reacting to  the downturn. The Programme for Government has the economy at the centre of all  that we do. Some Members from the Ulster Unionist Party clearly do not think  that that is not enough. However, we believe that the economy should be at the  centre of everything that we do now and in future.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Jennifer McCann spoke about the construction downturn. The  Executive will spend approximately &pound;5&middot;5 billion on public capital projects over  the CSR period. That should help to provide considerable buoyancy, especially  for the larger firms in that particular sector.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Robin Newton mentioned the fact that 95% of private-sector firms  in Northern Ireland  are small businesses. That amounts to more than 132,000 businesses. Mr Newton is  correct to say that confidence is key. His party colleague George Robinson also  spoke about that issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The need for innovation was mentioned. We have the regional  innovation strategy for Northern    Ireland action plan 2008-11 and the MATRIX  report, and I hope that those will progress meaningfully. I fully recognise the  significant impact that the downturn is having on many sectors, businesses and  individuals throughout Northern    Ireland. As I outlined today, and on  previous occasions in the House and elsewhere, we are taking whatever steps  that we can to help.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must also look to our national Government to deal with  the issue. That is why I very much welcome some of the UK-wide initiatives that  the Chancellor announced in his recent pre-Budget report. I reiterate the  comments of Mr Weir, who said that he found it strange that the &ldquo;little Ulster&rdquo;  party in the corner was so keen to talk about the greater Union at the weekend,  but that now it does not want to look at what our national Government are doing  for the economy. I regret that; however, let them answer for themselves.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  You were not even listening to us.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: I had to listen to you during the debate, thank you very much. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For example, the reduction in VAT to 15% &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. The Minister has the Floor.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: For example, the reduction in VAT to 15% until the end of 2009  should provide some stimulus to consumer spending and support for the retail  sector. I welcome the small-business finance scheme to support bank lending to  small exporters. I also welcome the new business payment support service, which  will allow businesses in temporary financial difficulty to pay their HMRC tax  bills to a timetable that they can afford. I understand that 50 firms in Northern Ireland  have availed themselves of that service to date.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The deferral of the planned increase in small companies&rsquo;  rate of corporation tax should also be of help. Those steps and the significant  reduction in interest rates in November and again last week, alongside the  recapitalisation of the banking sector, are targeted at minimising the depth  and duration of the downturn in the UK economy. However, I think that  we all wish that the banks would focus more on being banks, but because of the  terms under which they received the Government money, they are looking to  recapitalisation, instead of looking to what they should be doing &mdash; lending to  small businesses.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That is an issue that we will have to examine, because, at  present, the banking market is distorted. Banks are not behaving like banks,  because they are more focused on paying money back to Government rather than on  lending money to small businesses.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The recent fall in the value of sterling should also help.  Locally produced goods and services will be more competitive, which will  present good opportunities for export-based companies.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I also welcome the steps that the UK Government  are taking to help homeowners at this difficult time. The new homeowner  mortgage support scheme, which the Prime Minister announced last week, should  enable people in proven distress to defer a proportion of the interest payments  on their mortgage for up to two years, with the UK Exchequer providing a  guarantee to banks and building societies.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We cannot underestimate the short-term pressures that local  businesses are facing as a result of the global downturn, but it is important  to keep focused on the medium-to-longer term priorities that are laid out in the  Programme for Government. That includes ambitious goals for the economy, but  given the downturn, we may need to be more patient as we seek to achieve those.  The same holds for all Ministers of the Executive who have an input in  supporting the economy at this difficult time. As Minister of Enterprise, Trade  and Investment, I am committed to ensuring that the right policies and  programmes are in place to deliver on the commitments of the Programme for  Government.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If the Member for Lagan Valley Mr McCrea is wondering why I  did not take his intervention, it is because I did not take well to being  insulted as a solicitor in his initial comments. In the future, he should look  to himself before he makes comments about me.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the House last week, I announced the review of economic  development policy as it relates to my Department and Invest NI. Work on the  review is under way, and I look forward to those recommendations because they  will be useful and timely.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the debate. Undoubtedly, these are difficult times  for businesses, not only in Northern Ireland  but throughout the UK  and the rest of the world. However, I reassure Members that the Executive and  my Department will do all that they can within the power and the resources that  are available to us to assist businesses at this time. The challenge is to  ensure that they are put in pole position when the global economy begins to  strengthen.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  welcome the total consensus on the content of the motion and the amendments.  There was also a fair degree of consensus during the debate, although it was  certainly not total.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Stephen Farry referred to the benefit from the Barnett  consequentials. Having looked at the figures, any new Barnett consequentials do  not amount to very much. On capital, they amount to nothing, and on revenue,  the most that they amount to in any one of the three CSR years is 0&middot;25% of the  total budget of the total departmental expenditure limit. At approximately &pound;20  million, that is a useful amount, but it is nothing to get terribly excited  about.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Ian Paisley Jnr referred to mismanagement in DSD over the  sales of Housing Executive houses. We can all differ in our views, but there is  no need to be gratuitously unpleasant. The use of the word &ldquo;mismanagement&rdquo;  comes into that category. If one were to go out to the streets anywhere in Northern Ireland,  one would struggle to find anyone who would say that the difficulty in selling  Housing Executive houses this year had anything to do with mismanagement in the  Department or by the Minister. Apart from Ian Paisley Jnr, no one would apply  that word; his tone and words do not reflect well on him. When Mr Paisley got  serious, he referred to the problem of the rating of vacant business  properties, and I welcome his agreement on that point.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If I understood her correctly, Jennifer McCann said that  firms from the South cannot compete on the same terms. She talked about large  firms, and I assume that she meant large contracts, which would be advertised  in the Official Journal of the European Union and conducted under EU rules.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  will certainly give way; it is as well that the House is fully informed about  what the Member really meant.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Companies in the South face the same problems with getting access to the  procurement process as companies in the North. That is exactly what I said.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  At the time, the Member referred to large firms. I am glad to have that  intervention; one can only smile at some of what goes on here, and there were  some quite humorous moments in the debate.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">8.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Jennifer McCann would not take an intervention when asked,  and then had great difficulty in cutting her speech short when time was called.  Some lessons will have to be learned by the Sinn F&eacute;in scriptwriters so that  certain sections of a speech can be marked as capable of being deleted without  damaging its integrity. Therefore, when Sinn F&eacute;in Members are caught out by the  Speaker, they will be able to bring their remarks to a close.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  cannot think why, but I will.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  Thank you, a LeasCheann Comhairle. The Member criticised the manner in which  another Member delivered his comments. I ask Mr O&rsquo;Loan to reconsider the  comments he has made about Sinn F&eacute;in.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  intended those remarks to be taken as humorous. Claire McGill cited as evidence  a roughly torn-out piece of an anonymous newspaper. It is difficult to quarrel  with evidence of such a standard.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Basil McCrea clearly does not like fat-cat barristers. I  wonder whether that remark places him on the Labour wing of the Ulster Unionist  Party.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Since it is Christmas, let me say that I meant no disrespect to Members who are  solicitors or barristers. My point was that it is useful to have expertise in  some other areas. I hope that we can all work together on that basis.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  On another positive note, I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comments and the further  immediate actions that she indicated that she will take.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  agree that this was a fairly constructive debate. There was a degree of  agreement across the House. The Assembly should send out a strong collective  message that we are seized of the severity of the situation in Northern Ireland.  It is not my intention to engage in narrow point-scoring, but to seek to  challenge the Executive when they are not acting in a timely, effective or  decisive manner. There are some areas in which they could act much more  effectively.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That said, one must accept the context in which the  Executive operate. Neither problems nor solutions lie entirely within their  control &mdash; probably, the bulk of both lie beyond it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to clarify something for the Minister. I did not  suggest that Northern Ireland  would suffer a deeper recession than the rest of the United Kingdom; rather, I believe  that it will be shallower, due to the public-sector cushion. My point concerned  the fear that recovery in Northern    Ireland could be slower.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Northern Ireland  is protected in certain sectors, but it is particularly vulnerable in respect  of housing because of the very rapid rise in house prices that preceded the  recession. That is a particularly difficult issue for us.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Housing is a big issue here, because of the extent of the price bubble. The  other side of the coin is that financial services are not as big an aspect of  the economy here as elsewhere in the United Kingdom.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the comments of the Minister with respect to  energy and renewables. That was a very positive statement of opportunity for Northern Ireland,  and we will watch closely to see how that develops.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Despite his attack on the legal profession &mdash; and his apology  &mdash; Basil McCrea made a point about a step change. The Programme for Government,  the investment strategy and the Budget must be seen in context. I take the  Minister&rsquo;s point that the downturn was acknowledged during the first quarter of  the year. The combined efforts of our Executive and Strabane District Council  may have served as a warning to the rest of the world.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, things have changed significantly over the course  of the year, and there is a need to reconsider the priorities in those  documents. In particular, I urge the Executive to focus, not just on whether we  deliver on the current capital spend, but on whether we should be accelerating  the capital spend.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The second point is that, in doing so, we must examine the  wider issue of how we restructure and rebalance our economy, and whether those  investments can be to the long-term good. Other Members have mentioned the need  to invest in various skills, such as research and development, and those are  all important points.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, the accountability of the banks has been a  major theme throughout today&rsquo;s debate. I wish to make a point in response to  Jennifer McCann&rsquo;s comments, which I do not mean as a personal attack. It is  important that the banks bear in mind the support that is being given to them  by the people of Northern    Ireland. The overall size of the economic  support emanating from the Westminster Government is around &pound;35 billion. If  that sum were divided across the United Kingdom,  the taxpayers and businesses of Northern    Ireland would be potentially contributing  around &pound;1 billion. In the light of that degree of commitment from the people of  Northern Ireland  to support the integrity of our financial system, it is clear that the banks  have obligations regarding accountability. Although it has no direct  responsibility for the financial sector, the Assembly is the voice of the  people of Northern Ireland,  and there must be more willingness from the banks to engage with the Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A number of other important points were made during the  debate today: one was the rating of empty properties, which is certainly an  area which we must rethink. I am prepared to put my hand up and admit that at  the beginning of the year I believed it to be a good idea. In the context of  the economy, at that point, I believed that it was important to ensure that  buildings were used effectively. However, as the facts have changed, so too has  my opinion. We must revisit the issue and apply a similar approach to our  examination of the Budget, the investment strategy for Northern Ireland  and the Programme for Government.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  Today&rsquo;s debate has been both good and positive; apart from the introduction of  some terseness towards the end. I thank all of the Members who have  participated. I also thank and welcome the Alliance Party and SDLP&rsquo;s  amendments, which the UUP &mdash; and the rest of the House, I see &mdash; are happy to  accept.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My criticism of the Executive is based squarely on the five  months of inactive, ineffective Government, while squabbling was going on  between the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in. I hope that people listened to me on that point,  and did not just pick up what they wanted to hear.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Hard times in a recession bring no comfort, least of all to  hard-pressed, hard-working small businesses. I have heard what has been said in  the debate today &mdash; particularly by the Minister &mdash; with respect to the various  initiatives that are in place. However, waiting on initiatives is a luxury that  some people cannot afford.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have pushed for fairer, more equitable access for small  companies into the procurement process, and my colleagues on the Finance  Committee have voiced similar views. The letter that I referred to in last  week&rsquo;s &lsquo;Belfast Telegraph&rsquo; from people in the construction industry as good as  &mdash; and quite rightly &mdash; demanded a fair crack at procurement contracts. However,  those views, and the views in today&rsquo;s debate, are being expressed while a  rumour worryingly gains strength suggesting that there is an underhand,  unwritten understanding between some financial bureaus and some Departments. Those  rumours suggest that some &mdash; but not all &mdash; Departments are holding back on  delivering projects in order to create underspends in this financial year, thus  helping the Executive manage their deficit, which many now believe to be around  &pound;500 million. The House must know what is going on. We must see clear evidence  that there will be no underspends, no hold-ups on projects, and that  departmental spending tills will be emptied. It is up to every Member who sits  on a Statutory Committee to be alert and ensure that no underspends occur under  his or her watch.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, we must urgently review all of our current  commitments on public spending. That will enable us to release advanced  flexibility into our economy through the funding of various projects that will  have a direct impact on our economy and that will inject real confidence and  certainty by helping our local employers stay in business. That is the key.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We also need to be aware that national action could have an  adverse impact on Northern    Ireland, and we must be proactive in  preventing that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I recently raised my concerns that the efficiency savings  of &pound;5 billion in 2010-11, which the Chancellor announced in his pre-Budget  report and in his statement of 24 November, would impact directly on the Northern Ireland  block grant, from which we receive the vast bulk of our spending. Certainly,  the Secretary of State for Scotland  thinks that it will impact on the Scottish block grant, and I do not see any  reason why Northern Ireland  would be any different. In our situation, we must look at every possibility:  that is what this debate is about and that is why it has been brought forward.  We need to take a long look at reprioritising the distribution of funding  across Departments urgently and at a redesign of our overall economic package,  which will help to keep people in work and that will sustain the many viable  businesses that are in trouble now, largely through the disgraceful lending  behaviour of the banks.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Accelerated infrastructure and construction programmes need  to be put in place as a matter of urgency. We need to set up a parity watch on  those accelerated programmes. The Northern   Ireland economy is even more vulnerable than the UK economy as a  whole: that is what people are saying about the recession. It will take longer  for us to recover, and that recovery will be set back if we do not match, or  even improve on, the energy and the level of activity in accelerated building,  construction and infrastructure programmes of the London Government.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must ensure that Northern Ireland does not fall  behind the level of increased capital spending across the sea because of a lack  of flexibility in the finances of the devolved Administration. Lack of spending  flexibility must not condemn Northern    Ireland to becoming an economic sink-hole.  Our per capita earnings are already significantly below those in the rest of  the UK.  It is our duty to ensure that all local banks, which are subsidiaries of  national banks, adhere to the Government&rsquo;s new proposals and mortgage-support measures,  which would defer repossessions by two years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must demand the extension of rental and buy-back  arrangements with no financial penalties for those people with  mortgage-repayment problems, so that as many people as possible can remain in  their homes. Having and holding on to a home is so important. We must urgently  review the bankruptcy and administration laws, and have a close look at  no-blame arrangements similar to the chapter 11 protection arrangements for  businesses, partnerships and individuals in the United States. That could help  prevent the twin evils of fire sales and asset stripping that we will see.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must also have renewed action, energy and greater  imagination over the vexed issue of corporation tax. I believe that we should  approach the Treasury again, but this time we should ask for a range of  time-limited differential tax-rates aimed at specific types of firms, such as  knowledge economy, high-research and development-focused firms. That could be  set within the context of the economic downturn. It could be represented as a  business recovery plan, and could be rolled out nationally and negotiated  within the European competition guidelines.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Why not look again at the increase in the borrowing margin  permitted by the UK Government to the Northern Ireland Executive? We are in  dire circumstances. Why not seek an increase in the absolute amount in light of  prevailing circumstances? If we could do that, would we not also be negotiating  more favourable long-term and more relaxed use of the facility with a  significant decrease in the interest that it accrues? However, that should only  be done if it is part of an economic recovery plan, with the money being  diverted into job-protection and job-creation measures, and cash-flow relief  for the small businesses who, we all agree, are the backbone of our economy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have personal experience of that. However; it does not  make me an expert. Due to the combination of inexperience, bad advice and cash  flow, and a recession some time ago, I lost a business. I went home and told my  wife and my young children, who did not really understand, that the house had  to go. That is what people such as me had to do. It would probably not happen  now, but it happened 25 years ago: the house did go.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">8.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I know of hundreds of people who are going through that  experience now, or who will go through it in the months ahead. We cannot turn  them down or shun them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When I say that I understand that there is a global  recession and that I think that we should do more to help, people chastise me  or joke about the Tories and the Labour Party. I am not talking about that  rubbish. I am talking about us letting people in that situation know that  perhaps there is a way, but more importantly, that there is a will.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When I lost my business, the whole world collapsed. Imagine  having to tell your wife that your house has to be sold. It feels as though  everybody is talking about you, and there will be cretins who will talk about  you for the sake of it &mdash; usually, they owe you money. Nevertheless, those  people will talk about you and joke about you. They would perhaps not be able  to do anything if something similar ever happened to them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I understand small business. I am not talking about dramatic  rescues, but like the couple in my constituency that I alluded to, I know that  the world can fall in on people. We must reach out to what we refer to as the  backbone of our economy and tell people such as that couple that we are going  to find a way out. I do not know what that way is, but I know that part of it  is saying to such people that we will listen to them and hear them and inject  some confidence into them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If any of those people are listening, I found a way out. I  was lucky; I fought my way back, and I learned from that experience. It was  tough. Let us not bring that burden on to too many people.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Before I put the Question on amendment No 1, I advise Members that  whether or not that amendment is made, the Question on amendment No 2 can still  be put.</p>
