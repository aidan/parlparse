    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The Assembly met at 10.30 am (Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr  Molloy] in the Chair).</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="1"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Swine Flu</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I inform Members that the Speaker has received notice from the  Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety that he wishes to make a  statement regarding swine flu.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: I take this  opportunity to provide an update for Members on the Northern Ireland response to the  swine flu virus. There have been a number of developments during the summer  recess. During the summer months, I have continued to participate in regular  Cabinet Office meetings with ministerial colleagues from across the UK. My  Department remains in regular contact with officials in the Republic of Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Worldwide, there have been more than 275,000 cases and more  than 3,000 deaths. In the UK,  there have been more than 70 deaths. In the main, the illness continues to be  mild and self-limiting, although, for some people, it can be severe. To date in  Northern Ireland,  we have had 217 laboratory-confirmed cases. However, the actual number of cases  is much higher, with almost 9,000 courses of antivirals having been prescribed  to people who have been clinically diagnosed as having swine flu. In addition,  the number of people who are consulting their GPs with flu-like symptoms is  significantly higher than in previous years at this time.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Until now, 94 people have been hospitalised with swine flu  in Northern Ireland.  I have also been informed of a second death that was possibly associated with  swine flu. Obviously, every death is tragic, and my thoughts and sympathies are  with the family. Members will understand and respect that it is not appropriate  for me to make any further comment at this time.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although the levels of flu have been decreasing since their  peak at the end of July, we should not be complacent. The scientific experts  have advised that it is unlikely that that downward trend will continue. We are  preparing for a surge in cases later this year and potentially for a more  severe pandemic strain.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We now know more about the virus and its effects, and we  have been able to revise our planning assumptions. We have gathered more  information from experiences of the pandemic in the UK and internationally, which has  allowed us to refine our reasonable worst-case scenario. The timing of a possible  pandemic wave has also been reassessed. In the worst-case scenario, we can  still expect around 30% of the Northern    Ireland population to be affected by the  virus in a future wave. That means that approximately 500,000 people or one  third of the population may become ill with swine flu over the course of the  next wave. In addition, 5,000 people could be hospitalised owing to the virus,  and up to 525 could die. During the peak week, as many as 113,000 people could  be affected. Those are not predictions; rather, they are assumptions that  enable us to plan for the very worst that could happen. Scientists have advised  that a substantial peak in the virus may occur in mid- or late October.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I announced during the summer that advice had been received  from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) on which groups  should be prioritised for vaccine. When the vaccine is licensed, it will  initially be offered to individuals aged between six months and 65 years in the  current seasonal flu clinical at-risk groups; all pregnant women, subject to  licensing considerations; household contacts of immunocom&shy;promised individuals;  and people aged 65 and over who are in the current seasonal flu clinical  at-risk groups.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Those priority groups have been selected because they are  at higher risk of severe illness from swine flu. Prioritising them ensures that  we make best use of our initial quantities of vaccine. Front-line health and  social care workers will also be among the first to be vaccinated. The close  contact that they have with patients means that they are at additional risk of  contracting and transmitting the virus.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I expect to have sufficient vaccine for all those in the  initial priority groups by the end of November. I anticipate that a licence  will be granted in October; however, that is the responsibility of the European  Medicines Agency (EMEA), and I await its decision. I will continue to monitor  the emerging evidence and the expert scientific and medical advice before  taking any decisions on extending the programme beyond those initial priority  groups. Planning assumptions will also need to be revised to take into account  the impact of the vaccination programme.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased to announce that a UK-wide deal has been  agreed with the General Practitioners Committee (GPC) on administration of the  vaccine this autumn. The Department has agreed that GPs will receive &pound;5&middot;25 per  dose of vaccine given and that district nurses will assist by vaccinating  housebound people, in line with existing seasonal flu arrangements.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am grateful to GPs for their willingness to take on that  major vaccination programme. I am satisfied that their co-operation represents  value for money in delivering the programme. Preparations for GPs to immunise  the priority groups once the vaccine is licensed will now begin. Vaccination is  our best defence in the battle against swine flu, but we must also be prepared  for a significant increase in hospitalised cases. Experience elsewhere has  shown that up to a quarter of hospitalised cases may require intensive care.  Plans are in place locally and nationally to increase critical care capacity to  cope with the potential demands of swine flu. I intend to more than double  capacity in adult critical care. To provide that capacity in Northern Ireland,  47 adult ventilators are being procured.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department also plans to increase substantially the  number of paediatric critical care beds and recognises that some older children  may need to be cared for in adult critical care facilities, while receiving the  necessary support from paediatric staff. The number of appropriately trained  staff must be increased to support that additional capacity, plans for which  have been developed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Doubling critical care capacity will allow many more people  to benefit from critical care than would otherwise be the case. To achieve such  a significant increase, hospitals must deploy their trained workforce differently,  and they may also have to postpone non-urgent, planned operations to  concentrate staff and resources on the most seriously ill patients.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Keeping the public informed is a key element of our preparations.  To that end, I have a major communications programme planned for the autumn and  winter to maintain public confidence and awareness. That programme will build  on the work that has been done to date, including the very effective bus panel  advertisements that use the &ldquo;sneezing man&rdquo; image, which stresses the need for good  hand hygiene. To reinforce the message that people should stay at home if they  are experiencing swine flu symptoms, I ran a local advertising campaign. My  Department is developing leaflets and other public information to accompany the  swine flu vaccination programme.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the summer, England launched the National Pandemic  Flu Service in response to significant pressures experienced by GPs there.  However, the number of cases to date in Northern Ireland and the fact that  our primary care services have been coping well has not merited its  introduction here. The situation is constantly under review and, should the  need arise, that facility can be introduced quickly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To date, most of the focus in the pandemic response has  centred on the Health Service. However, if a more severe pandemic wave is  experienced later this year, we can expect to see significant pressure on  schools and local services. Recently, I met my ministerial colleagues from the  Department of Education and the Department for Employment and Learning to  stress the need for business as usual as far as possible during the pandemic,  and I am pleased to note that children have returned to school as normal  following the summer break. The Public Health Agency continues to work closely  with schools to ensure that local risk assessments are provided if significant  absentee rates are reported. Now that schools have reopened and with the onset  of the autumn/winter flu season, I do not expect the recent decline in the  number of cases to be sustained.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Yesterday, I met the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment. A future  pandemic wave could have a very disruptive effect on businesses due to absences  and difficulties with delivering normal services.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also met the Finance Minister to discuss funding for the  swine flu pandemic; later this week, I will meet him to continue those  discussions. The bill for dealing with the pandemic could be &pound;80 million or  higher. To date, we have spent almost &pound;30 million, most of which relates to  national initiatives, such as antivirals, vaccines, personal protection  equipment and antibiotics. That figure does not include costs such as the  delivery of vaccinations, antiviral distribution, staff backfill for sickness  absences and extra capacity in intensive care. There can be absolutely no doubt  that costs will rise.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My officials have developed and costed three possible scenarios:  a relatively benign estimate, assuming a moderate peak in demand; a reasonably  prudent estimate, factoring in our best assessment of the extent and place of  the pandemic; and a reasonable worst-case scenario. I have placed a bid of &pound;77  million for scenario 2 on the basis that it represents the most realistic  estimate of the costs that are likely to be incurred. Against that, I can find  a total of &pound;27 million, which is more than one third of the cost. I must remind  the House that without funding there will be serious consequences for the  health and social care service, patients and the public.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Regular hand washing and respiratory hygiene remains the  single most important thing that people can do to protect themselves and  prevent the spread of the disease. If people have flu-like symptoms, they  should stay at home and call their GP, who will provide advice. People should  not go to their GP surgery or to a hospital, as they may spread the disease to  others.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We cannot predict with certainty when the pandemic will  peak in Northern Ireland  or the number of people who will need hospital treatment. However, our robust  preparations enable us to ensure that we can respond to any scenario, even the  worst case that I outlined at the beginning of my statement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We must not be complacent. Although this is not a killer  virus, it can kill; therefore we must continue to put plans in place that are  proportionate to the threat. I am confident that our Health Service will cope  with any increase in the number of cases in the coming months. I will continue  to keep Members updated on a regular basis, and I commend the statement to the  House.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr Wells)</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement, and I also thank his staff for the  regular updates that Members of the House and members of the Committee have  been receiving.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the Minister knows, the Chief Medical Officer and his  assistant briefed the Committee on this issue. Indeed, during quite a long  meeting, they also briefed the Deputy Chairperson and me. Openness and  transparency throughout the process will reassure the community, so I hope that  that trend will continue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I extend my sympathy to the family of the baby who  apparently &mdash; we are not yet certain &mdash; died as a result of swine flu, the second  victim in Northern Ireland.  I am sure that the House will join me in extending our sympathies to that  family.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am, however, concerned about the decision that was taken  on a UK-wide basis to pay GPs &pound;5&middot;25 for administering each swine flu vaccine.  If everyone in Northern    Ireland is vaccinated, the bill will be  almost &pound;9 million. Given that GPs secured an extremely generous pay review  three years ago, which has led to a 50% increase in their pay to an average of  &pound;108,000 per annum, it is a bit rich of the BMA to ask for further payments for  the administration of vaccines. Frankly, GPs should have agreed to do that as  part as their contract.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">10.45 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My questions about that decision are as follows: first, is  it binding on Northern    Ireland, or do we have any choice in the  matter; and, secondly, has that figure of &pound;9 million been built into the  Minister&rsquo;s assumptions for the future cost of the swine flu pandemic, which has  gone up from &pound;55 million to approximately &pound;70 million? Will the &pound;9 million be  included in that figure, or are we expecting that some form of grant aid will  become available from the mainland? Finally, on a minor point, will the  Minister reassure us that student nurses will be included on the front-line  services priority list for vaccination?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I assure Mr Wells that all  front-line Health Service staff will be vaccinated as a matter of priority.  Without the staff, we obviously cannot continue to operate our hospitals and  Health Service.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On the substantial point that Mr Wells made about GPs,  Members will be aware that the GP contract is negotiated nationally and applies  to England, Scotland, Wales  and Northern Ireland.  Although I was kept informed throughout, this negotiation was carried out in London with the GPs&rsquo;  contractors. GPs are independent contractors who operate in the Health Service  through the GPs&rsquo; contract that is agreed nationally. They provide two essential  work streams: essential services and additional services. Part of the  additional services is referred to as directed enhanced services, and that is  where this negotiation and deal comes from, because it is work outwith their  normal workload.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Whether the contract negotiated three years ago was prudent  is not a matter for me at this stage; I was not involved in that. In general,  GPs in Northern Ireland  provide an extremely good service for our patients. The front line is moving  forward towards primary care, and our focus &mdash; the shift left of the Health  Service in Northern Ireland  &mdash; is about prevention being better than cure. Our GPs are very much in the front  line of that, and their services are increasing all the time. People are aware  that, when they go to the GP now, it is not simply a doctor; a whole range of  services is being provided. I anticipate that GP services will increase. It is  clear that this is an additional service that GPs provide.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We want GPs to administer the vaccinations because they  have their patients&rsquo; records and know who is in the priority risk groups. GPs  can easily identify priority risks and deal with them accordingly.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, Deputy Speaker. I thank the Minister for his statement and  for the updates that we get on a regular basis. I also thank all those who have  been working either directly or indirectly on the issue of swine flu. We should  recognise that hard work has been done on swine flu by the health sector.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Like the Minister, I extend my sympathy to the family of  the child whose death, it seems, is the second associated with swine flu. It is  unwise for the Minister to make any additional statement at this point, but it  would be useful to have further details through time.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister indicated that 94 people had been  hospitalised. It will be useful to have an idea of how many of those 94 people  were in intensive care. I am hearing reports that people have been ill enough  to go into intensive care.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister went on to say that people who have symptoms  that they think are associated with swine flu should not go to their GP or  their local hospital. I am still hearing reports of people ringing GPs&rsquo; surgeries  and being asked to come to the surgery, even though they say that they have the  symptoms that are associated with swine flu. There is an issue with that. Has  the Minister heard any of those reports? If so, what can we do to ensure that  GPs&rsquo; surgeries do not allow that to happen? If those people have swine flu and  they end up in surgeries or in hospitals, the purpose of the measures that the  Minister is advising in his public statements is being defeated.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I am surprised at the Member&rsquo;s  second point about people phoning their GPs and being told to come to the  surgery; that should not be happening. Perhaps there is confusion over the  symptoms being reported or what the proper response should be, but the proper  response is for people to stay at home and not come out and spread the swine  flu.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A number of people are in intensive care. I do not have to  hand the number of people who went to hospital and ended up in intensive care,  but it is a substantial portion of those whom the Member mentioned. I will  determine what that number is and respond to the Member in writing.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement, which he made immediately upon coming  back for the new term. I associate myself and my party with the Minister&rsquo;s  remarks about the death of the small child. It is very sad that a family is in  mourning. It would be useful to receive any further details if they become  available. Our thoughts and prayers are very much with the family at this time.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister spoke about a future surge in cases. That  will, of course, create extra costs for and pressure points on the Health  Service. When does the Minister think those pressure points will arise, if the  financial arrangements as to who is paying for the associated costs are not  sorted out quickly? Where will that hit? As we go into the autumn and winter,  knock-on effects will be felt. In his statement, the Minister mentioned the  effects on services. If the finance is not sorted out quickly, when will those  effects start to bite?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I have given a robust and  realistic estimate of the costs, and that is the middle scenario. To date, we  have expended around &pound;30 million, with more to come. That is what is required  to protect the population. In my budget settlement letter, along with the other  parts of the settlement, I stated that I will bid for resources to deal with  pandemic flu. That is what I am doing at the minute, and I am discussing that  bid with the Finance Minister. It is clear that if we do not live up to our  budget settlement, there will be issues not only for the Health Service, but  for every Department and for all of us. Discussion on that is still going on.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to a white knight coming from the Treasury, I  listened to Mrs Robinson&rsquo;s optimistic response to me that the Treasury was  going to pay the swine flu costs. I still have no knowledge of that, so I am  waiting to hear of any developments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Jim Wells made a point about the costs. All the estimates  for the costs, as far as the GPs are concerned, are contained in the amount. I  am trying to hold the money and the costs as best and low as I can alongside  achieving value for money and so on. Ultimately, however, we have a responsibility  to protect our population, many of whom will come to harm if we do not take the  steps that we are taking.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement. I extend my sympathy to the baby&rsquo;s  family. It is a sad time for them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I share the Health Committee Chairperson&rsquo;s concern about  remunerating the GPs individually for each vaccination. They do a good job, but  they are well paid already, and this situation is a health crisis.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister have a particular communications strategy  in place for ethnic minorities, who may not be so aware of or understand our  public health system and issues around health and safety?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I understand what Mrs Hanna has  said about GP remuneration. However, as I have said, those payments are being  made as part of a national deal and contract of which we are very much part  and, frankly, one from which we benefit more than we lose.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As far as ethnic minorities are concerned, the Department  will be making every effort to ensure that everyone receives the proper and  correct information. I am re-examining that for the autumn, and the Department will  continue to upgrade and refresh that information as we go along. The Department  has already made considerable efforts in the production of a guide to the  Health Service for ethnic minorities who come from a different linguistic  tradition and who are not completely fluent in English. I will continue to  re-examine that, because it is very important that people receive the necessary  information and that the Department provide that information to them.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Deeny</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement. I also thank him and his Department for  their work since this major health issue became a global one. The Minister&rsquo;s  statement has answered some of the questions that I intended to ask him, and I  am delighted to see that the priority groups will be vaccinated by the end of  November.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Is the Minister happy that the vaccine safety checks have  been completed and that the safety profile of the vaccine will be good enough?  I am aware that that is a European issue, but what is the view locally?  Furthermore, will any surplus vaccine be made available to the general public  after the priority groups have been vaccinated? Moreover, will regulations be  made that will mean, for example, that we cannot vaccinate the general public  until priority groups have been covered?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: As far as priority groups are  concerned, decisions are very much determined by the Joint Committee on  Vaccination and Immunisation. That committee advises COBRA &mdash; the civil  contingencies committee &mdash; on those issues, and the groups that I have detailed  are the groups that COBRA considers to be most at risk. However, that will be  only the initial phase of the vaccination programme, and, as I said, we should  be in a position to have all the initial priority groups vaccinated by the end  of November. We also have a delivery schedule for vaccines, and we will move  through the general population after the priority groups have been vaccinated.  Again, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, after taking expert  advice from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), will  determine the steps to be taken.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">By the end of December, we anticipate having almost 1&middot;5  million individual doses of vaccine to hand. The current plan is that everyone  will receive two doses of the vaccine, although I understand that in China the  entire population is being vaccinated on a one-dose strategy. That is something  that the Department will monitor carefully, and it will take the advice that is  offered.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Vaccine safety is governed by the European Medicines  Agency, which is examining the safety of the new vaccine, just as it does for  other medicines and vaccines. As I understand it, the vaccine will not involve  injecting a live virus into anyone. The H1N1 vaccine will be very similar to  the H5N1 vaccine that is used to treat seasonal flu, with some modifications  made to take account of the new virus. Therefore, tried and proven medical and  scientific technology, knowledge and expertise will be applied as it is every  year with seasonal flu. That should provide comfort for everyone.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>: I  praise the Minister&rsquo;s Department for the good work that it continues to carry  out.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister commit to being the first man in Northern Ireland  to receive the vaccine? That would show goodwill to the people here and would  demonstrate that the vaccine is safe. Furthermore, the Committee for Health,  Social Services and Public Safety was told last week that around 9,000 people  here have received Tamiflu, and I also understand that quite a number of people  diagnosed with swine flu has not been given antiviral drugs. Will the Minister  give the accurate figure for the number of people in Northern Ireland who have had swine  flu? Does having had swine flu mean that those people do not need to get the  vaccine?</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.00 am</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I do not fall into the priority  risk groups for those who will receive the vaccine and, therefore, I am not  entitled to it. However, if I believe that public confidence requires it, I  will be happy to be the first person to step forward and take the vaccine,  because I will be absolutely certain that it is safe. Based on my knowledge, I  will also advise members of my family to take the vaccine.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Prescriptions for over 9,000 antivirals have been issued so  far, and that is a good indication of the number of people who have taken the  swine flu medication. We do not know whether those who have had swine flu will  be free from the risk of getting it again. We do not know how the virus will  perform, so I think that the advice would be that those people should be  vaccinated. The advice is also that those people may have immunity for a year  or two, but we cannot be certain: therefore, we will always put safety first.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  statement and commend his Department for the work that has been done.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One of the difficulties is that so much is based on  speculation and assumption about what might happen. The Minister said that  there has been a decrease in the number of cases since July. We expect that  there will be a peak week in mid-October, but the vaccine will not be licensed  until late October and will not be available until November. How can we reconcile  that chronology to ensure that what is happening will be an effective means of  dealing with the swine flu pandemic?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: We can have confidence because,  as the knowledge of the virus increases with experience, so the planning  assumptions can be modified, and that is the case. We are working on  assumptions and not on predictions, but those assumptions inform us as to how  we model what will happen. The assumptions now tell us that there has been a  reduction in the estimate of the number of fatalities involved and the number  of hospitalisations. Nevertheless, the numbers are substantial. Those numbers  will be revised again, and they may move upwards or downwards. The situation is  based on international, national and regional experience.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The vaccine will be available for use in a vaccination  programme once the licensing process is complete. We will always put patient  safety first. The licensing process will take place in October. We will then be  able to go forward and give the population the protection that it requires.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  I thank the Minister for keeping us informed during the summer months about  this serious epidemic that has hit Northern Ireland. It is regrettable  that we have had two deaths as a result of swine flu. On behalf of my party, I  extend my sympathy to the family of the infant who died.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Approximately &pound;8 million will be required to deal with  swine flu. Does the Minister agree that, if the Finance Minister does not meet  that bid, it will have serious consequences for the Health Service? The  situation is urgent, and I hope that when the Minister makes his bid the  Finance Minister will heed the call. Northern   Ireland is crying out for it, and the people of Northern Ireland  deserve the best treatment that is humanly possible.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also record my thanks and appreciation to the officials from  the Minister&rsquo;s Department who will attend the Health Committee and brief us in  the days and months ahead.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: As far as the necessary resource  is concerned, as I outlined in my statement, a robust estimate of the amount  needed has been made, and I am having discussions with the Finance Minister. As  everyone is aware, the budget settlement included provision for pandemic flu.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The response is a national response: the approach being taken  in England, Scotland, Wales  and Northern Ireland  is the same, and I will be having another discussion with the Finance Minister  in due course. The swine flu pandemic is a serious challenge to the health of  the population of Northern    Ireland, and the Health Service has a duty  to meet that challenge. Obviously, there will be a resource implication for  whatever steps are taken. I have outlined that from the beginning, and I  anticipate that the House will not be found wanting as far as protecting our  people is concerned.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement. At all times he has tried to bring us  as much information as possible, but sometimes we are concerned about some of  the detail that we do not know.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In his statement, the Minister said that he hopes to  increase the number of critical care beds and train up staff. I welcome that  because even in normal times there are not enough beds to meet the needs. In my  constituency, two children had to be transferred to England  and Scotland  during the Christmas and New Year period last year. In relation to children and  young people, in particular, how many new beds will be provided and where will  they be located? Is the budget for the provision of critical care capacity  included in the Minister&rsquo;s bid, or is it additional? The Minister stated that  &pound;27 million could be found: are any other services being impacted adversely  because of the need to move money around?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: As far as the challenge ahead is  concerned, hospitalisation in many cases will require critical care capacity, a  point made by Sue Ramsey. I anticipate that critical care capacity, as far as  beds are concerned, will more than double and that paediatric critical care  beds will follow suit. Clearly, there is an issue regarding associated  staffing, and we are planning for that at the moment. Robust plans are in  place, and the trusts have worked very hard to get those plans in place. It  will have an effect on other activities in hospitals, and I have outlined those  possible effects in my statement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The amount of money needed is included in my estimate of  costs, as it properly should be. That is part of the response as we work our  way through vaccinations, medical countermeasures, workforce planning, the  steps being taken nationally as well as regionally, and the steps that we are  taking on critical care capacity. All of those steps must be taken to ensure  that the Health Service is able to cope with the anticipated demand. We expect,  and the modelling shows, that the period will last for around 15 weeks and will  peak roughly halfway through that 15 weeks. There could be more than 100,000  cases during that critical period. That will present a huge challenge to  primary and secondary care in our hospitals and will affect the capacity to  treat people through critical care, particularly priority risk groups such as  young people and the elderly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The &pound;27 million that I have contributed is money that I  have been able to identify in the health budget. Obviously, I would rather  spend it on something else, but we all have to prioritise. When money is short,  the thing to do is prioritise what is most needed.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement. I want to ask about communication and the  impact of swine flu on the management of the Health Service. The Minister has  rightly pointed out the advice to people not to go to hospitals or GPs if they  have flu-like symptoms. How does that sit with one of the other stated  objectives of the Health Service, which is that of trying to manage the level  of people keeping appointments, particularly at hospitals? I have come across  cases of people who have cancelled appointments being lectured and warned that  if they cancel further appointments they may miss their opportunity to see a  specialist. How can we reconcile the different messages that are being given  out?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: This is an emergency; we are not  dealing with our normal situation. Cancelled appointments represent a  considerable expense for the Health Service, and we are trying to reduce them  as much as possible. The percentage of people who do not up for appointments is  running at around 10%. That represents a large number of people, and it costs  the Health Service a lot of money.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Against that, however, we are asking people to be  responsible and to exercise some personal judgement, and that involves not  turning up at the doctor&rsquo;s surgery or the hospital if they believe that they  have symptoms of swine flu. Those symptoms are available for all to see through  the various strands of the communication strategy that we have been involved  in. That communication strategy is about keeping the general public as informed  as possible. We have done that to date, and we will continue to do that  because, as far as our population is concerned, keeping them informed is  crucial.<strong><span style="font-size:12.0pt; "> </span></strong></p>
    <p class="H5StageHeading"><a name="2"></a>North/South Ministerial Council</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Language Body Sectoral Format</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Speaker has received notice from the Minister of Culture, Arts  and Leisure that he wishes to make a statement on the North/South Ministerial  Council (NSMC) meeting in language body sectoral format.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure (Mr McCausland)</strong>: In compliance with section 52 of  the Northern Ireland Act 1998, I wish to make the following report on the  eighth North/South Ministerial Council meeting in language sectoral format. It  is the fourth such meeting since the restoration of the Northern Ireland  Executive and Assembly, and this report has been endorsed by Caitr&iacute;ona Ruane  MLA.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The meeting was held in Gweedore on 9 July 2009. In it, my  first meeting, I represented the Northern Ireland Executive as Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure, along with Caitr&iacute;ona Ruane, the Minister of  Education. The Government of the Irish   Republic were represented  by &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v TD, Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. The  meeting dealt with issues relating to the language body and its two constituent  agencies: Tha Boord o Ulster-Scotch, the Ulster-Scots Agency, and Foras na  Gaeilge, the Irish language agency.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will now present a summary of the issues discussed by the  Council on 9 July 2009. The Council received progress reports from the  chairperson and chief executive of the Ulster-Scots Agency, Mr Mark Thompson  and Mr George Patton respectively, and the chairperson and chief executive of  Foras na Gaeilge, Mr Liam &Oacute; Maoilmhich&iacute;l and Mr Ferdie Mac an Fhailigh  respectively.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council noted the ongoing collaboration between the  agencies on a range of projects. Those include working with Irish language  officers in district councils with a view to offering the lecture series  &lsquo;aspects of our shared heritage&rsquo;; a film in Irish about the Ulster-Scots  language and culture, which has been completed and will be broadcast on TG4;  continuing co-operation on human resources and corporate governance issues; the  preparation of a joint disability action plan; and the preparation of a joint  policy on child protection. There have also been joint stands at a number of  events; for example, the national ploughing championships and the Tall Ships  event in Belfast.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council noted the progress made in regard to the annual  reports and accounts for the North/South Language Body, including the  presentation of the 2004 accounts to the Northern Ireland Assembly and both  Houses of the Oireachtas in Feburary 2009. Both agencies, in conjunction with  the sponsor Departments, are continuing to address outstanding issues in  relation to the 2005 and subsequent annual reports and accounts as a priority.  The Council requested a further report on progress for the next NSMC meeting in  language sectoral format.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.15 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council discussed staffing issues in Foras na Gaeilge  and the decentralisation of Foras na Gaeilge staff to Gweedore. The Council  asked the sponsor Departments to continue to examine the Foras na Gaeilge  staffing submission in light of the 2009 financial allocation. The two posts  for Belfast,  which were approved by the NSMC in 2008, were filled in February 2009.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council discussed and approved the introduction of a  revised financial assistance scheme for use by the Ulster-Scots Agency. The  amended scheme extends to consideration of applications relating to travel  claims, community workers and project start-date payments for events. Those and  other changes are designed to improve the practical operation of the scheme.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council noted the resignation of Mark Thompson as  chairperson of Tha Boord o Ulster-Scotch and acknowledged his contribution to  the work of that body. The Council approved the appointment of Peter Gallagher  to the board of the North/South Language Body from 9 July 2009 to 12 December  2011. Mr Gallagher will have responsibility for exercising the functions of the  body through Foras na Gaeilge.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council agreed to hold its next meeting in language  sectoral format in November/December 2009.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure (Mr McElduff)</strong>: Go raibh  maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Ba mhaith liom mo bhu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis  an Aire as a r&aacute;iteas inniu.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Minister for his statement. He said that the  2004 annual accounts of the North/South Language Body were presented to the  Assembly and to both Houses of the Oireachtas in February 2009. However, the  accounts for 2005 to 2008 are still outstanding. That is of particular concern  to the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure, which has been examining how  the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure manages its arm&rsquo;s-length bodies, in  particular their financial accountability. When does the Minister expect the  outstanding accounts to be signed off?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister also said that the chair of Tha Boord o  Ulster-Scotch, Mr Mark Thompson, had resigned. When does the Minister expect a  new chair to be appointed? Finally, was the development of an indigenous  languages strategy discussed at the meeting in relation to the Irish language  and to Ulster-Scots? If not, when does the Minister intend to consult Foras na  Gaeilge and the Ulster-Scots Agency on the draft strategy?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I thank the Member for his questions. He asked  about the delay in publishing the annual reports and accounts of the  North/South Language Body. The accounts for 2000 and 2001 were qualified by the  Northern Ireland Audit Office. There was, therefore, a delay in signing off the  body&rsquo;s consolidated accounts. That eventually happened in 2004, but, as a  result of the delay, the 2000 reports and accounts were not published until  2005. Subsequent annual reports and accounts were also delayed, as the Northern  Ireland Audit Office must audit the accounts chronologically.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The 2001 report from the body was published in June 2006,  and the 2002 and 2003 reports were published in May 2007. The 2004 report was  published in February 2009, and, at the NSMC meeting in July, the Council  requested a further report on progress for the next NSMC meeting in language  sectoral format. The matter is, therefore, being progressed as quickly as  possible. There is a general concern to get this matter back on track and  totally up-to-date, but the problem originated in 2000 and 2001, and there has  been a chronological knock-on effect.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A new chair will be appointed to Tha Boord o Ulster-Scotch  as soon as possible.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, the indigenous languages strategy is an internal Northern Ireland and United Kingdom matter. Therefore,  it was not discussed at the North/South Ministerial Council and is,  consequently, not a matter for discussion this morning but for another  occasion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Browne</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement. I would be pleased if he could confirm  that the 2009 budget for the language body has been approved. If not, when is  it likely to receive endorsement from all sides?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: For a number of reasons, work on the budget for  2009 is still in progress. The draft 2009 business plan for the North/South  Language Body is still under consideration by both sponsor Departments and both  Finance Depart&shy;ments, in line with budgetary processes in Northern Ireland  and the Republic. The sponsor Departments will work together to finalise the  business plan and budget and bring it together for approval at a future NSMC  meeting.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At their meeting on Thursday 10 September 2009, the  Executive noted the efficiency saving guidance for North/South bodies that was  agreed by both Finance Ministers. It was agreed that the Department of Finance  and Personnel will circulate the guidance to sponsor Departments. North/South  bodies, like all other public bodies, need to maximise efficiency in light of  the current economic climate.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his somewhat sparse statement. I feel for him somewhat  because I am sure that his expedition into deepest Donegal was a very lonely  experience and that the die had been cast before he got there.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am struck by the fact that the report indicates that there  has been a lack of progress in the Ulster-Scots field. Historically, the  Ulster-Scots language has lagged behind the island&rsquo;s other minority language.  Was there any discussion at all about the way in which that quite obvious  leeway should be made up?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The report appears to contain several points that show  where the mechanics of getting moneys, help and aid to the Ulster-Scots  community have been allowed to drift. Can the Minister assure the House that,  under his tutelage, those matters will be addressed much more forcefully than  they have been in the past?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I note Mr Robinson&rsquo;s point that the report is  sparse; however, it is an accurate reflection of what was discussed at the  meeting.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I share the Member&rsquo;s concerns about progress on  Ulster-Scots language and culture. I am keen to see those matters taken  forward. A number of areas needed attention, and my predecessor highlighted  those at an earlier stage by saying that community development and community  empowerment for the Ulster-Scots community must be emphasised. There is a  renewed focus on those matters; such a focus had not been in place in previous  years, going back to 2000-01. That is reflected in the financial assistance  scheme, which has now been brought forward. Prior to that, there was difficulty  with funding workers in the community, and that area will now be accommodated  by the financial assistance scheme.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To paraphrase Ken Robinson, he talked about moving towards  parity and equality. If we are to have a shared and better future in Northern Ireland  to which we are all committed, our society must be based on equality. I am  committed to the Executive&rsquo;s desire to work towards that shared and better  future, but good relations will be sustainable only if they are aligned to the  equality agenda; they cannot be built on unequal foundations. Therefore, I will  seek to address the current imbalances between Ulster Scots and Irish and  strive to achieve parity of esteem and parity of funding for both. I think that  we have made significant progress to date. For example, between 2005 and 2008,  funding allocations from the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure to Ulster  Scots almost doubled, and funding for Irish increased by just over 6%.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Progress is being made. However, I agree with the Member  that there is still some distance to go.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an  r&aacute;iteas &oacute;n Aire, c&eacute; go bhfuil s&eacute; tana&iacute; go leor ar a l&aacute;n beala&iacute;.

    <p class="B3BodyText">C&uacute;is bhuartha domh go raibh dh&aacute; nuacht&aacute;n Gaeilge againn sa  t&iacute;r seo go dt&iacute; le d&eacute;ana&iacute;: nuacht&aacute;n laeth&uacute;il sa Tuaisceart, &lsquo;L&aacute;&rsquo;; agus nuacht&aacute;n  seachtaini&uacute;il sa Deisceart, &lsquo;Foinse&rsquo;.

Ba  mhaith liom a fhiafra&iacute; den Aire ar pl&eacute;adh ceist na nuacht&aacute;n sin ag an chruinni&uacute;  i nGaoth Dobhair.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Chomh maith leis sin, ba mhaith liom &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Is it not protocol in the House that,  when a Minister makes a statement, questions are asked? It is not an  opportunity for a Member to make a statement in a language that 80% of the  House probably does not understand.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  On a point of order. Perhaps Mr Morrow is more of an expert on procedures than  I am. Is it in order to raise a point of order during a debate on a Minister&rsquo;s  statement? It may be.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I am quite certain that the Member will come to a question as soon  as possible.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Le f&iacute;rinne, s&iacute;lim gur chuir  m&eacute; ceist n&oacute; dh&oacute; le linn na cainte a rinne m&eacute;, agus t&aacute; br&oacute;n orm n&aacute;r thuig an  tiarna uasal thall an m&eacute;id sin.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Ar aon n&oacute;s, m&iacute;neoidh m&eacute; an sc&eacute;al sin go mion nuair a  dh&eacute;anfas m&eacute; aistri&uacute; ar &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Member to come to his question.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Creidim go bhfuil s&eacute; de cheart agam labhairt i nGaeilge anseo, agus go bhfuil  s&eacute; de dhualgas orm an m&eacute;id a deirim i nGaeilge a aistri&uacute; go B&eacute;arla ina dhiaidh  sin.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I will take any points of order at the end of the debate. Again, I  ask the Member to come to his question. It is not the time to make a speech.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker. I believe that, under the rules of the  House, I am permitted to speak in Irish and that I am obliged to translate  whatever I say in Irish into English. I intend to do so. During my contribution  in Irish, I asked a number of questions. I understand that Lord Morrow may not  have realised that. I assure him that I asked several questions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Minister for his statement, although it is, as  Mr Ken Robinson pointed out, rather thin. There is an overemphasis on  bureaucracy and an underemphasis on actual language projects. I ask the  Minister whether, during the Council meeting, the question of Irish language  newspapers was raised. There were two in Ireland:  &lsquo;L&aacute;&rsquo;, which was published in Belfast  and unfortunately, due to lack of funding, had to wind up; and the weekly  newspaper &lsquo;Foinse&rsquo;. Was that issue discussed at the meeting? If so, can the  Minister report on it to the House?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I am fascinated that such a long speech in Irish  contracted to such a short question. Interestingly enough, Irish language  newspapers were discussed. I was interested to be informed by the Republic&rsquo;s  Minister that, in fact, there are larger sales for English tabloid newspapers  than for Irish language newspapers in the Gaeltacht.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  statement. I congratulate Dominic on his contribution. In fact, his  contribution was much longer and contained a lot more detail than that which  the Minister provided today. Well done, Dominic.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.30 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to let the Minister and Members know that, during  the recess, some members of the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure were  not always on holiday. We spent some time on the north Antrim coast visiting language  groups, which we are discussing today, including Carntogher Community  Association, the Ullans Speakers&rsquo; Association in Ballymoney and Gaelscoil an  Chaistil in Ballycastle. Those three visits proved very interesting; however,  the most interesting of them was &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind the Member that he must ask a question on the statement.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  The question is coming now, Mr Deputy Speaker. The most interesting visit was  to the Ullans Speakers&rsquo; Association, which is made up of the Ulster Speakers&rsquo;  Society, the Ulster-Scots Agency, the Ulster-Scots Community Network and the Ulster-Scots Academy. All the groups said that their  funding is inadequate, which is an issue that Ken Robinson spoke about earlier.  The association said that the council discussed and approved &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  Mr Bradley spoke about that, too.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I am speaking in English, yet Lord Morrow is not even giving me a chance. Where  do we go from here?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The council discussed and approved &mdash; that is the important  point, Mr Deputy Speaker &mdash; the introduction of a revised financial assistance  scheme. I am sure that the Ullans Speakers&rsquo; Association will be delighted to  hear about that. The group had the highest commendation for &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v TD  from the South of Ireland and for his contribution &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I will ask the Minister to answer that question, if it is one.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I hope that the Minister can answer that question. Go raibh maith agat, a  LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I thank the Member for his comments and his  question. I think that the report accurately reflected the meeting, which was  brief and businesslike. I can only report what actually took place. I  acknowledge the Member&rsquo;s comments about the Ulster-Scots Agency financial  assistance scheme, which the Ulster-Scots community very much welcomes. The  financial assistance scheme is in keeping with the previous Minister&rsquo;s  commitment on community development and empowerment. In fact, it represents the  outworking of that commitment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The revised financial assistance scheme was approved at the  meeting of the North/South Ministerial Council in language body sectoral format  on 9 July. Applications are being evaluated and determined by the Ulster-Scots Agency&rsquo;s  board to ensure compliance not only with the scheme but with the agency&rsquo;s  strategic, corporate and business plans. My understanding is that the agency is  also holding a number of roadshows so that people will be properly informed  about the opportunities that are now available through the scheme. The general  point about equality of funding is one that I have already dealt with and that  I fully endorse.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  Members will be glad to hear that I am not going to give an account of my  holidays and of where I was during the summer. I will simply ask questions on  the Minister&rsquo;s statement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome Mr McCausland to his new position as Minister. It  is great to see him here. I also pay tribute to Mark Thompson, the Ulster-Scots  Agency&rsquo;s outgoing chairperson, for his hard work and for the significant  contribution that he has made.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">First, the Minister spoke about progress reports in his  statement. He said that the Ulster-Scots Agency and Foras na Gaeilge had a  joint stand at last month&rsquo;s Tall Ships event. I presume that the stand was  there. I am sure that everyone who attended the event enjoyed a very nice day,  but I certainly did not see the joint stand there. Will the Minister confirm  where it was located? Was it hidden somewhere near a burger stand or placed out  of the road?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Ask a question.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  That is a question. That from the man who asked five questions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, we are all aware of the significant numbers of  people who are involved in Ulster Scots in Donegal. Will the Minister indicate  what the cross-border bodies have done to encourage members of the Ulster-Scots  family in Donegal? What have they done to ensure that every contribution and  effort is being made to make them feel fully part of the process? Sometimes  they feel as if they are not involved.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: The Tall Ships event was a success. So many  people were there that I must confess that I did not see the stand, even though  I was there on a couple of occasions. However, I am reliably informed that the  joint stand was at Custom House    Square.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster-Scots community in Donegal is concentrated  mainly in the Lagan area of east Donegal and along Donegal Bay  in south Donegal. There are Ulster-Scots groups in both of those areas, and  work is being done through the agency and the Ulster-Scots Community Network  with those groups in a number of ways, such as through projects and  cross-border activities. It is good to maintain the relationship between  Ulster-Scots communities in the Republic and Northern Ireland. There were some  very good projects such as festivals in Donegal and publications about the  contribution of Ulster Scots to the Donegal area.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brolly</strong>:  An cheist at&aacute; agam: an bhfuil a fhios ag an Aire cad &eacute; an cine&aacute;l taispe&aacute;ntais a  bh&iacute; ann ag an Tall Ships agus a bheas ann i gCill Dara an tseachtain seo  chugainn?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">What kind of stall or joint exhibition was at the Tall  Ships event, and what kind of stall will there be at the National Ploughing  Championships in County   Kildare?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I did not see the stall at Custom House Square. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, having seen displays by both bodies on other  occasions, I assume that the stall consisted of publications by Foras na  Gaeilge and the Ulster-Scots Agency as well as displays of various aspects of  both languages and cultures.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In answer to the comment that was made from a sedentary  position, the point was already made that the Tall Ships event was such a  success and attracted so many people that it was difficult for anybody to see  everything that was on display.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement. I will be much briefer than other  Members. Will the Minister clarify whether the Ulster-Scots Agency can fund  travel by community groups outside Northern   Ireland or the Irish   Republic?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: The issue of travel is long-standing and has  been a difficulty for Ulster-Scots groups, particularly those in east Antrim  that look across the sea to Scotland.  Although Scotland  is their nearest neighbour and is only a short distance away, they have been  unable to access support for joint projects with, and visits to, their  counterparts there.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The agency has reviewed its financial assistance scheme,  which was approved by the North/South Ministerial Council on 9 July. That  allows the agency to consider the provision for travel arrangements for community  groups to travel outside the island   of Ireland. Obviously,  the particular focus will be on Scotland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In determining whether a particular application will be  approved, the agency will take a number of factors into account. Groups may  wish to travel to undertake research that will lead to a report or publication;  attend a conference or seminar to promote greater understanding of the  Ulster-Scots language and culture; or to facilitate community representatives  who need to travel to undertake joint projects with groups that are based in  Scotland and that will ultimately benefit the Ulster-Scots language, culture or  history.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. I thank the Minister for his statement. I was very  impressed with his comments about a shared future based on equality and human  rights; he did not actually say &ldquo;human rights&rdquo;, but I assume that he concurs  with the sentiment. He talked about the notion of building good relations based  on equality, which is something that he along with others could give leadership  on and is something that we would concur with.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister talked about the decentralisation of some  Foras na Gaeilge staff to Gweedore. Is there a time frame for that likely  decentralisation?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I note the Member&rsquo;s comments on a shared and  better future. It is not within my ministerial remit to comment on that, but I  did comment on it on a radio programme this morning and explained the reasons  for the delay in bringing forward the strategy for cohesion, sharing and  integration. That delay is not due to Members on this side of the House.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The delay in filling Foras na Gaeilge&rsquo;s posts is due to a  number of issues. Obviously, the Irish Government&rsquo;s decentralisation policy  applies to Foras na Gaeilge, but there have been protracted negotiations  between the unions and management regarding the posts that will be moved to  Gweedore.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Due to market forces, Foras na Gaeilge has had problems  with staff retention. Finally, the recruitment of specialist staff who speak  Irish and who wish to live in the Gaeltacht has been problematic. It is an  ongoing piece of work, but it is not something for which a particular date was  given. Therefore, I will have to look into it and make further enquiries. In  due course, I will provide a written answer. I am not sure how informative that  answer will be, but I will endeavour to do that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  I declare an interest as a member of the Randalstown Ulster-Scots Society,  which sits in the Randalstown Memorial Orange Hall.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister referred to financial assistance and travel  costs. What criteria will the agency apply when supporting travel claims?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I think that I covered travel costs a moment  ago: they have to be for something that is going to produce real benefit. For  example, travel might involve attending a conference in Scotland on an  appropriate theme or a joint research project that involves co-operation with a  Scottish group.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Quite a number of Ulster-Scots organisations in Northern Ireland are members of parent bodies in  Scotland.  There are already strong links, particularly between east Antrim coastal  groups, in places such as Ballycarry and Cairncastle, and groups in Scotland. To  ensure that we get value for money, there would have to be clearly demonstrable  results from any travel, and it must bring the maximum benefit to the wider  community.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: That concludes questions to the Minister on that statement. The  Speaker has received notice from the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure that  he wishes to make a statement regarding the North/South Ministerial Council.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:  I will take that point of order before we conclude this item of business.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  There is a facility in the House for Members to speak in English and Irish.  There is a clear onus upon those who decide to speak in Irish that they must  give a full interpretation, in English, of what they have said. Mr Deputy  Speaker, I would like you to look at what has been said in Irish today, because  when I heard the interpretation in English, it took around a quarter of the  time than when spoken in Irish. I would like the Speaker&rsquo;s Office to take a  look at the translation situation.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I will ask the Speaker&rsquo;s Office to come back to you on that, Lord  Morrow.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  On a point of order, a LeasCheann Comhairle. On a practical level, it would be  very helpful if all Members could avail themselves of the simultaneous  translation system that officials benefit from. The infrastructure is already  in place &mdash; c&oacute;ras aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in &mdash; and Members&rsquo; understanding of what is being  said in Irish would be aided and speeded up by access to that system.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I will ask the Speaker to deal with that and come back to it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. In relation to the enquiry that Lord  Morrow asked you to make to the Speaker&rsquo;s Office, nuair a bh&iacute; m&eacute; ag caint i  nGaeilge n&iacute; ba luaithe agus nuair a rinne m&eacute; iarraidh an m&eacute;id a d&uacute;irt m&eacute; i  nGaeilge a aistri&uacute; go B&eacute;arla gur chuir tusa faoi bhr&uacute; m&eacute; deireadh a chur le mo  chuid cainte.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When I made a contribution earlier in Irish, I proceeded to  attempt to translate it into English. However, Mr Deputy Speaker, you hurried  and harried me and asked me to bring my remarks to a conclusion. If a full and  frank translation was not provided by me, it was not out of any lack of intent  to do so, but because of the time constraints that you placed upon me.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: That will be part of the review. I will also review your challenge  to the ruling that I gave you to ask a question.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.45 am</p>
    <p class="H5StageHeading"><a name="3"></a>North/South Ministerial Council</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Inland Waterways Sectoral Format</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I have received notice from the Minister of Culture, Arts and  Leisure that he wishes to make a statement about the North/South Ministerial  Council (NSMC) meeting in inland waterways sectoral format.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure (Mr McCausland)</strong>: With your permission, I will  make a statement, in compliance with section 52 of the Northern Ireland Act  1998, about a meeting of the North/South Ministerial Council in inland  waterways sectoral format.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The meeting was held in Gweedore, County Donegal  on 9 July 2009. The Executive were represented by the Minister of Education,  Caitr&iacute;ona Ruane, and me. The Government of the Irish Republic  were represented by &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v TD, Minister for Community, Rural and  Gaeltacht Affairs. The statement has been agreed with Caitr&iacute;ona Ruane, and I  make it on behalf of us both.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr John Martin, chief executive officer of Waterways  Ireland, provided a report on progress that included several significant  achievements. The Council noted that Waterways Ireland received a  sustainability award for its headquarters from the Royal Institution of Chartered  Surveyors. Moreover, Boyle marina in County   Roscommon received the  award for best marina development at the local authority management awards.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council noted that 79 metres of additional moorings had  been provided, with 23 metres at the Round O in Enniskillen, 20 metres at Camus  on the Lower Bann and 36 metres at Portglenone on the Lower   Bann. The Council noted the further develop&shy;ment of the Lakelands  Initiative campaign for the Erne/Shannon system from Belleek to Limerick, which  will continue with the distribution of brochures under the overarching title &lsquo;Lakeland and Inland  Waterways&rsquo;. The 2009 sponsorship programme has been well received, and over 50  events have been approved.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council received a presentation on the restoration of  the Royal canal and noted its successful enhancement to further develop access  to the waterways and waterside activities and to complete its connection to the  Shannon. The Council received a progress  report on the restoration work for the Clones/Upper Lough Erne section of the Ulster canal,  including a survey of that section of the canal, which was to be completed by  mid July. The Council also noted the recent consultations with local  stakeholders and the programme for completion of the project. The Council noted  Waterways Ireland&rsquo;s annual report and accounts for 2008, which were presented prior  to being laid before the Assembly and the Oireachtas.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council agreed proposals for a number of property  disposals in the context of a range of development projects on the waterways  and noted progress on property-management issues, including the pilot  registration project. It also noted future plans for property registration on  the Royal canal and the Grand canal. The  Council agreed that its next meeting in inland waterways sectoral format will  take place in November or December 2009.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure (Mr McElduff)</strong>: Go raibh  maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. T&aacute; an tAire gn&oacute;thach sa Teach inniu; n&iacute;l  aon amhras faoi sin.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I note with pleasure the Minister&rsquo;s reference to Waterways  Ireland&rsquo;s achievement in obtaining a sustainability award for its headquarters  in Enniskillen. In May 2009, the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure held  its weekly meeting at the Waterways Ireland headquarters and toured the  building. It is a very impressive setting.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister referred to a programme for the completion of  the project to restore the Ulster  canal from Upper Lough Erne to Clones. The Committee has a keen interest in  that matter. Will the Minister indicate when the Ulster canal will reopen? He will  be aware of ongoing interest in the matter, led by the Blackwater Regional  Partnership, which is based in Caledon.  A recent public information event there was attended by his ministerial  colleagues, including Mr Poots and Michelle Gildernew. Will the Minister  provide some hope to the campaigners who are involved in the restoration of the  Ulster  canal?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: Waterways Ireland  is working on the section of the Ulster canal between Clones and  Upper Lough Erne. That project will cost &euro;35 million. The construction cost of  that section is being funded by the Irish   Republic. Waterways Ireland intends  to seek planning permission for that project by mid-2010, which will be  followed by tendering for a detailed design and build contract.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Browne</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement. I would be pleased to ascertain whether  he is considering the appointment of a board to Waterways Ireland, and, if so,  what the likely composition of such a board would be.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: Since taking office, I have been of the opinion  that there is much to commend the appointment of an oversight board. Arising  from the St Andrews Agreement, a review of the effectiveness and efficiency of  North/South implementation bodies is under way. If that review recommends a  board for Waterways Ireland, Ministers in the NSMC will have to consider that  issue along with our counterparts in the Irish Republic.  It would be premature to comment on the composition of such a board at this  stage. However, I am interested in that matter, and I know that it is being  considered.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement, which is much meatier than his previous  one. He mentioned the pilot registration project. It would be helpful to  Members if he could explain what that project entails.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I note also that the Minister&rsquo;s statement mentions the  obvious progress that has been made on inland waterways in the Republic of Ireland. That is to be welcomed: it will  give a great boost to the tourism and leisure industry down there. However, the  emphasis in the statement is on the link between the Shannon and Erne systems,  and the Ulster  canal link to those waterways. I remind the Minister that the Ulster canal  runs into Lough Neagh near Maghery, on the River Blackwater. That area could do  with some development. Given, in particular, the current favourable exchange  rates, will he consider ways in which that section of canal could be brought  forward for scrutiny, approval and, eventually, perhaps, a rebuild?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also welcome the work that has been done at Camus and  Portglenone on the Lower Bann system. I am  sure that my colleague from East Londonderry will comment on the potential of  the Lower Bann and the Lough Neagh basin,  which generally remains untapped. We have an opportunity to build the good  practice that we have seen south of the border into our own infrastructures for  the benefit of leisure and tourism in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: The pilot registration scheme is nothing to do  with registering pilots: it is about registering property. There were issues  about the ownership of land and how that land, previously owned by various  people, came together under the aegis of Waterways Ireland. The pilot scheme is  operating in the Republic; registration of ownership of land in Northern Ireland  is being dealt with separately.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are currently no plans to develop the next section of  the Ulster  canal. The outline business case that was submitted to the Department of  Culture, Arts and Leisure in December 2006 concluded that the preferred option  was to restore the south-west end of the canal. However, when the decision was  taken to proceed with the south-west section between Clones and Upper Lough  Erne, Ministers in the NSMC agreed to keep the remainder &mdash; from Clones to Lough  Neagh &mdash; under review. The matter is now under review, but there are no plans at  present.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will pick up on Ken Robinson&rsquo;s point about the economic  and other benefits of improvements to the Lower Bann  system. In 2008, Waterways Ireland completed 36 metres of additional moorings  on the Lower Bann at the Vow, near Coleraine.  Works on the Lower Bann include jetties and  moorings at Christie Park in Coleraine, which were completed in 2003-04;  jetties and moorings at Kilrea, which were completed in 2005-06; and  refurbishment of the lock house at the Cutts in Coleraine. Several works were  carried out at Mount   Sandel in 2006-07, which  cost approximately &pound;386,000. Work is ongoing to an extent, bit by bit, on the Lower Bann. I agree with the Member about the benefits of  such improvements. I am sure that, as lots more money becomes available in  future, those projects will be taken forward. There are financial constraints  on that; nevertheless, it is very much in mind.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>:  Ken Robinson has stolen my thunder to some degree.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the 20 metres of additional mooring that has been  provided near Coleraine, and acknowledge that Waterways Ireland, with  responsibility for the develop&shy;ment of the Lower Bann,  has been outstanding in its performance. Sadly, the other Government agencies  have not been.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When will an overall plan be announced for the development  of the River Bann, which would have the potential to create hundreds, if not  thousands, of new jobs in leisure and tourism? Could that be a topic for  discussion at the next meeting of the intergovernmental body? I do not care  whether that is held in Gweedore or Cullybackey; the important issue is that  the potential of the Lower Bann is not missed.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: Unless Gweedore moves into Northern Ireland,  the next meeting will not be held there. The next meeting will be held in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I share the Member&rsquo;s interest in the Lower   Bann. I will write to the Member with some thoughts on that. That  would be the most appropriate and effective way of dealing with that question.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I am disappointed by the response  that the Minister gave to an earlier question on the Ulster canal. The Minister said  that there were no plans to complete the restoration of the Ulster canal up  to Lough Neagh. I understood that the restoration was starting from Lough  Neagh. The report includes the words:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the programme for completion of the project.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">It is not a completion. If it were a completion, it  would go up to Lough Neagh. The Minister has said that there are no plans to do  so; will he elaborate on that?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The report also states:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Council agreed proposals for a number of property  disposals in the context of a range of development projects&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Will the Minister tell us whether there have been  any discussions with property owners in those consultations? Do they agree with  the plans for the Ulster  canal?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: The project that is under way is to restore the  canal from Clones to Upper Lough Erne. At present, there are no specific plans  beyond that. People will recognise a desire to have the network completed in  due course. However, that is the situation at present.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Waterways Ireland  disposed of six properties that required NSMC approval. They were all in the Irish Republic;  there were none in Northern    Ireland. None of the disposals was  financially significant.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his comments on the proposals. The Minister&rsquo;s report  refers to receiving a presentation on the restoration of the Royal canal. It is  good to see the Royal canal being highlighted. Will the Minister confirm what  contribution the Irish Government are making to the improvement work on the  Royal canal through the North/South bodies?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I share the Member&rsquo;s delight in the affection  for all things royal in the Irish   Republic.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The funding of capital works in the Republic is entirely a  matter for the Government of the Irish   Republic. They fund 100%  of capital works in the Republic; we do not contribute. We pay 15% of the  revenue costs for Waterways Ireland, and the Republic pays 85%, which is  proportionate to the amount of miles of navigable waterway in Northern Ireland  and in the Republic.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement, and thank him and his ministerial  colleagues for the work that was done at the meeting. The Minister kindly  indicated the budget for a section of work that is being carried out on the Ulster canal.  Will he tell us whether that programme and its budget have already been subject  to the kind of efficiency tests that the two Departments of Finance are  subjecting the North/South bodies to?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the budget be subject to such a test in the future?  Have the proposals been passed by &ldquo;An Bord Snip&rdquo; in the South, or will they be  under review?</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.00 noon</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: At the meeting, there was no mention of any  derogation from the Irish   Republic&rsquo;s commitment to  fund the project. That section of work, from Clones to Lough Erne, is entirely  funded by the Republic. There was no mention that the Republic would step back  or withdraw from that, and there the matter rests.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. An t-am seo ba mhaith liom a  fhiafra&iacute; den Aire an bhfuil aon phleananna ann chun sc&eacute;imeanna nua a thabhairt  isteach faoi obair na Comhairle. Are there plans to bring any new schemes into  the council&rsquo;s work?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I will make a further comment on the previous  question before I come to that one. At the meeting, it was mentioned that there  will be efficiency savings, North and South. However, there was no specific  mention of funding of the Ulster  canal.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have now forgotten Mr Bradley&rsquo;s question.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Are there plans for any new schemes?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I assume that the question refers to whether it  is intended to bring any other waterways into Waterways Ireland; there is no  intention to do that. I have a list of the other waterways in Northern Ireland,  but those are not in the domain of Waterways Ireland. There is no further  consideration as the situation stands.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>: I  also congratulate the Minister on his statement. There has been much talk about  two particular canals this morning. However, has the Minister any plans for the  Lagan canal, which I consider to be the most important canal in Northern Ireland?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: With regards to the Lagan canal and linking Belfast to Lough Neagh,  the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure owns residual property rights that  remain in Government ownership as a successor in title to the former Lagan  Navigation Company. Those are primarily the locks and towpath on the 12-mile  lower Lagan navigation, which links Stranmillis in Belfast with Sprucefield and Lisburn. Capital  projects of that nature, even if viable and feasible, are unlikely to be wholly  financed by central government.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department met local authorities and other bodies that  have an interest in the Lagan navigation with a view to developing a strategy  for possible reopening in the future. To that end, the Lagan Canal Restoration  Trust was established in 2008-09. It is funded by the four local authorities,  the Northern Ireland Environment Agency and my Department, and it aims to  explore the scope for funding and delivering the 27-mile project. By way of  support, my Department agreed to fund the trust in commissioning an economic  appraisal for the potential reopening of the lower Lagan canal. That report is  due for completion in September 2009.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am also delighted to confirm that works to restore the  Department&rsquo;s lock three at Newforge, with financial assistance from the  Heritage Lottery Fund, will be completed by the end of October 2009. That will complement  the restoration of the adjoining lock house, which was recently completed by  Castlereagh Borough Council.</p>
    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="4"></a>Executive Committee Business</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Forestry Bill</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Second Stage</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development (Ms Gildernew)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a  LeasCheann Comhairle. I beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That the Second Stage of the Forestry Bill [NIA 11/08] be  agreed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Our current forestry legislation dates back to 1953 and  reflects the priorities of an era when commercial timber production was the  main focus. The legislation has served its purpose for much of the period since  1953. However, it has been evident for some time that forestry is of  significant importance for reasons other than timber production, although  timber production continues to be important, particularly for the North&rsquo;s economy  and in supporting local industry and rural jobs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The impact of continued deforestation on climate change and  biodiversity has raised concerns globally. It is widely recognised that  increasing forest cover can enhance the many benefits that forests already  provide, be they environmental, economic or social. The North is significantly  under-forested, with only 6% of the land area covered, compared with 10% in the  South, 12% in Britain  and 33% on average throughout the EU.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The forestry strategy that my Department published in 2006  acknowledges the need for the sustainable management of existing forests and a  steady expansion of tree cover. It seeks to deliver a more competitive forestry  industry in the North, and it provides for a balanced approach between  producing commercial timber, protecting the forest environment and providing  increased opportunities for forest-based recreation. Legislation must be in  place to provide a statutory framework to deal with those issues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The new Bill will address my Department&rsquo;s contemporary and  evolving commercial, environmental and social objectives for forestry. It will  allow us to obtain better value from the forest estate through creating new  revenue-generating opportunities, and it will enable us to secure better use of  recreational facilities and buildings. It will help to protect all forest trees  from damage, reintroduce a restriction on the felling of trees in private  woodland and provide a public right of access to state forests. Those are the  key principles of the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Before I comment on the generalities of the Bill, I want to  thank all those who responded to the consultation exercise that was carried out  by my Department last year on the proposals for new legislation. I also thank  the Chairperson and members of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural  Development for facilitating presentations from my officials on two occasions,  and for their comments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill contains 39 clauses and two schedules. It provides  a statutory framework within which the Department can deliver its forest  expansion and sustainable forestry objectives. Members will be glad to hear  that I do not intend to comment on every clause, because many deal with related  aspects of the same key provisions. However, I would like to explain the  thinking behind the main provisions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 1 creates the foundation of the Bill and describes  the Department&rsquo;s duty to promote forestry. That has been expanded beyond the  duty to promote traditional forestry, as outlined in the Forestry Act 1953, to  include the wider economic, environmental and social context of modern  forestry. The Bill thus seeks to reflect the modern understanding of what is  meant by sustainable forestry.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clauses 2 and 3 provide the Department with the main powers  to engage in and support the afforestation of land and forest activity,  including the acquisition and disposal of land. It also enables the Department  to provide facilities on forestry land to improve its amenity.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That provision will enable the Department to deliver social  and recreational forestry. Through arrangements with partners, for example, it  will be able to facilitate the provision of nature trails, viewpoints, car  parks, toilets, and so forth. Recently, the Department published a strategy to  develop the recreational and social use of its forests. Those provisions will  provide the Department with the powers to support the implementation of that  strategy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 4 includes provisions to allow the Department to use  or develop its forestry land for a purpose other than forestry. The aim is to  allow the Department to develop or facilitate what might be regarded as  non-forestry opportunities. Those include tourism opportunities, such as the  provision of forest chalets or cabins in forests and the development of  renewable energy possibilities, such as wind farms. The provisions will enable  the Department better to realise the full potential of its forests and, at the  same time, obtain better value from the public forest estate. However, in  exercising those powers, the Department will be required to have due regard to  its general duty to promote forestry, as outlined in clause 1.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 5 creates a new power to enable the compulsory  acquisition of land for any of the functions under the Bill. The Department  seeks that power primarily to help it to deal with situations in which its  forests and associated timber assets are landlocked, and access, even after  reasonable negotiation, cannot be secured. In those situations, the public  value of mature timber, which is the result of many years of public investment,  could be lost. Other circumstances in which land may be required include the  facilitating of access to planned recreation, tourism initiatives and for  biodiversity purposes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The power is widely drafted because the Department cannot  foresee the full range of contingencies that may require such a power.  Nevertheless, I appreciate that such a power could give cause for concern.  Indeed, the Agriculture Committee has already commented on that provision. I  assure the Committee and other Members that the power will be used sparingly  and only with ministerial supervision. The vesting process is described in  schedule 1 to the Bill and is based around the procedures that are used under  the Local Government Act (NI) 1972, which is considered to be the cornerstone of  modern vesting law, with all the established rights, including representation,  recourse to an inquiry by the Planning Appeals Commission, and compensation,  etc.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 6 provides for the Department to carry on inquiries  and to collect and disseminate the results, including the preparation and  publication of statistics for the purposes of any of its functions under the  Act. That is largely a carry-over from the 1953 Forestry Act.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 7 is a new power that allows the Department to:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;do anything which appears to it to be conducive or  incidental to the discharge of its general duty under section 1(1).&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That clause also allows engagement in partnerships  or participation in a body corporate in support of the Department&rsquo;s general  functions, which could, for example, include future recreational or  renewable-energy initiatives. The Forestry Commission in England and Wales has such powers under the  Forestry Act 1967. That power is not intended to be additional to the general  duty, but to supplement it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clauses 8 and 9 are intended to protect forest trees from  damage by wild animals. Clause 8 will allow the owner or occupier, in the event  of damage by wild animals to growing trees on his land, to cull such animals at  any time, either in his woodland or in any adjoining land that he owns. That  clause will apply to owners of any woodland, private or public.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 9 provides the Department with a power to deal with  damage or likely damage to any woodland, public or private, by wild animals  that live in adjacent lands in other ownership. The Department may serve a  notice on the occupier of the adjacent land that will require him or her to  deal with the problem. Failing that, the Department may enter the land and  control the wild animals on that land.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That provision has been the subject of concerns from  stakeholders with a game-shooting interest. However, our long-term aim is to  double the area of forest in the North, and that is likely to increase the  habitat that is suitable for forest-dwelling animals, including deer, which  have the capacity to damage woodland and to hinder woodland regeneration. Those  powers are designed to enable the Department to limit possible damage and would  be exercised only where landowners are unable or unwilling to address the  problem.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Similar provisions are contained in the 1953 Forestry Act  and in legislation in Britain  and in the South, but the proposed provisions in clauses 8 and 9 of the Bill go  further in certain in respects. For example, deer are now included under the  definition of &ldquo;wild animal&rdquo;. On that point, we need to appreciate the  protections that have been put in place for the Irish hare. I would like the  Irish hare to be outside the definition of &ldquo;wild animal&rdquo;, given that it is a  distinct subspecies and given the work that is going on in my Department and  with the Department of the Environment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 10 is a carry-over from the 1953 Forestry Act and is  a standard provision in forestry legislation that is aimed at protecting  woodlands, both public and private, from the threat of fire damage. It permits  the Department to serve a notice on the occupier of adjacent uncultivated land  where vegetation poses a fire risk to an area of forest. If the owner does not  respond to the notice, the Department may enter the land and remove or destroy  any vegetation that poses a risk. Some stakeholders have expressed concern  about that provision, but I refer again to our long-term aim of doubling the  area of forest in the North and the need for the Department to have powers to  protect woodland, whether in private or public ownership.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 11 offers protection to woodland owners or the  Department&rsquo;s authorised officials who take action under clauses 8, 9 or 10 of  the Bill against prosecution under the Wildlife Order 1985 or the Game  Preservation Act of 1928. Clause 12 includes provisions to restrict the burning  of vegetation that is close to forests and is another carryover from the 1953  Forestry Act. Clause 13 amends the Plant Health Act 1967 to provide powers to  make subordinate legislation to control the tree disease that is posed by wood  packaging.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clauses 14 to 29 deal with the felling of trees, and the  key provision is the requirement for anyone who wishes to fell trees on land of  0&middot;2 hectares or more to have a felling licence granted by my Department. That  will help to underpin the strategic objective of sustainable forest management.  The aim is to ensure that private landowners manage their land with due regard  to sustainability, including restocking, where appropriate, sites that have been  felled.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To obtain a felling licence, the landowner will have to  prepare a felling management plan for my officials to consider. The aim will be  to keep the management plan as simple and straightforward as possible. Felling  licences are already required in England,  Scotland, Wales and the  South; introducing them in the North is consistent with the principles of good  forest management.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A number of exemptions to the requirement to have a felling  licence have been included in the Bill; for example, the felling of fruit  trees, the topping or lopping of trees and the felling of trees in gardens.  Again, that is a pragmatic approach that does not place undue restrictions on  people and that will, hopefully, enable us to move forward without undue  bureaucracy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To safeguard the interest of private landowners, the Bill  contains provision for compensation in the event that an application for a  felling licence is refused. There is also a right of appeal against a decision  not to grant a felling licence. A further important provision, which includes  an appeal mechanism, is the power to require restocking after unauthorised  felling. Procedures related to an application for a felling licence and the  requirements of a felling management plan will be prescribed in subordinate  legislation, which will be subject to separate consultation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 30 introduces a statutory right of pedestrian access  to the Department&rsquo;s forests for recreation purposes, subject to by-laws, and  that has been welcomed by a range of stakeholders. The remaining clauses 31 to  39 include powers of entry; regulation-making powers; provision for amendments  and repeals; and provisions that relate to commencement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I commend the Bill to the Assembly. It provides the necessary  legislative framework to enable the Department to meet Government objectives in  relation to forest expansion and the sustainable management of existing woods  and forests, through which the many diverse social, economic and environment  benefits can be realised. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development (Mr Paisley Jnr)</strong>: At  the outset, I must say that if I have to leave the House early, it will not be  out of discourtesy to the House, the debate or the Minister; it will be because  there is an Agriculture Committee meeting later on. I hope that it does not  clash with the debate, but it may.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Second Stage offers the House the opportunity to debate  the Bill&rsquo;s principles. The Minister has taken us through those principles and  outlined the Bill&rsquo;s exact intention. The Bill is wide in scope and will repeal  the Forestry Act (Northern    Ireland) 1953, replacing it with a largely  new set of provisions to regulate forest and commercial tree felling.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When it was created, the 1953 Act was relevant for the  times in which people lived. In 1953, Britain  still bore the scars of the Second World War, and evidence of a war-torn Europe was everywhere. Open bomb sites with their  crumbling buildings were set amid a new kind of architecture of half-built  blocks of flats.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Those were the first signs of a redevelopment and  regeneration that demanded source materials, of which wood took primacy. The  production of timber was the thrust of the 1953 Act. No account was taken of  developing leisure activities, which remained very much the preserve of the  upper classes. The Act was unashamedly about timber production, because that  was, rightly, the priority of the day.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">More than 25 years ago, the great social historian Sir John  Colville wrote in his book &lsquo;The new Elizabethans, 1952 &ndash; 1977&rsquo;:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Whatever their station in life, the way people now  conduct their affairs differs, voluntarily or involuntarily, in both  opportunity and amenity from what was customary twenty five years ago. They  feed and dress differently, they talk, live and spend their leisure  differently, and they do so partly by choice and partly by force of  circumstance.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Now that we have a further 25 years on the calendar, how  much truer and more accurate Sir John&rsquo;s statement is today; how much greater  the emphasis that is placed on leisure; how much more conversant we have become  about our environment and the amenities that are, and should be, available to  us and to the people; how much greater the opportunity, then, through this  Bill, to produce a forestry Act that will be central to the strategic  development not only of the Forest Service, but of the strategies across which  the Northern Ireland Executive act; how great is the opportunity to link our  forestry strategy with health, tourism, environmental, cultural, education and  energy strategies; how great is the opportunity to engineer the circumstances  that would see the use of our forests heralded as an example of best practice  across the world &mdash; what a great opportunity is available to us.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, due to the circumstances and missed  opportunities that have been outlined, the Bill falls some distance short. The  Bill&rsquo;s primary thrust remains timber production, with lip service being paid to  other potential opportunities, such as economic, social, environmental and  recreational ones. Those are the opportunities that the Bill should seize and  exploit to their fullest extent.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Of course, the Forest Service must be reorganised, but I  believe that its potential is not being realised fully. For example,  substantial sporting tourism revenue is being lost as a result of the service&rsquo;s  potential not being utilised properly and exploited. Independent research from  consultants that has been made available to us identifies the fact that</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;sporting shooting contributes more than &pound;45 million  annually to the NI economy, sustaining 2,100 full-time equivalent jobs.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In Northern    Ireland, we spend a further &pound;10 million a  year on conservation and on managing something like 990,000 hectares of forest  around the Province. Given that significant resource, it seems to me that the  consultation should read into and consider the needs of those people who could  play a greater role in developing even more opportunities on forestry land.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I hasten to add that those views are not necessarily mine  or, indeed, those of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development; they  are the views of stake&shy;holders and those who wish to see the strategic  development of and investment in our forests. Indeed, they are the views  expressed in the European Community, which recognises that through regulation,  forests can contribute both to the Lisbon  objectives concerning economic growth and competitiveness and to the G&ouml;teborg  objectives concerning the conservation of natural resources.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In order to maintain that contribution, the Bill must be  adapted to be more open to the global market and to the current strategic  frameworks that are being developed through the Executive Departments. It needs  to be open to increasing our communities&rsquo; diverse recreational demands, to  those visiting our country, to the enhancement of our unique biodiversity, to  the development of the Northern    Ireland economy, and to the competitiveness  that is necessary. The Bill must open up opportunities, and I believe that it  could, and should, do that. Indeed, we should see to it that it is amended to  that effect.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that the Bill strikes a balance between the  commercial, social, economic, recreational, environmental and strategic  interests in our community, and I know that the Committee is keen to play its  role in that difficult task. The Committee wishes to see how those strands can  be woven together and how the Bill can connect the various sectoral strands and  interests that have been recounted to us today. We will listen to the  representatives of the key stakeholders. When necessary, we will challenge the  Department and the Forest Service to open the Bill to the diverse interests  that people have in our forests, and we will test the Department and the service  to see whether they can come up with a Bill that addresses our priorities today  and those that will arise in the future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We do not need a Bill that deals only with some limited  aspects of the timber industry; we need something that addresses the wide role  that can be exploited through our Forest Service.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As it stands, this Bill is about timber production. It is  about giving regulatory powers to the Department and to the Forest Service. It  is about strengthening the hand of the Forest Service, where it needs to be strengthened,  and the Department, and about protecting departmental interests. The Committee  recognises that those are important aspects that cannot be overlooked. However,  the Bill should and could do so much more. The House should be determined to  make it do so in order that the entire community can benefit where it can and  should from the forests and forestation in our country.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department also needs to ensure that it protects our  communities through exercising the proposed powers bestowed upon it by the Bill  in a considered and balanced manner. The Committee will, therefore, scrutinise  the Bill to ensure that the principles are appropriate and that they do what  they are intended to do in an appropriate manner and do not go beyond that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development looks  forward to receiving the Bill in Committee Stage.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to meet immediately upon the  lunchtime suspension. I therefore propose, by leave of the Assembly, to suspend  the sitting until 2.00 pm. The sitting is, by leave, suspended.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The sitting was suspended at 12.26 pm.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic" style="page-break-before:always;">On resuming (Mr  Speaker in the Chair) &mdash;</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. This Bill is the first piece of forestry  legislation to be introduced in the North of Ireland in over 50 years. We have  to take a bit of time and get it right. It is long overdue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">During recess, I had discussions with a number of  stakeholders, including the Woodland Trust, members of the private sector, the  Countryside Access and Activities Network (CAAN), local community groups in my  constituency and council officers who have responsibility for access and  tourism. I will base my contribution around those discussions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Forest policy reviews in 1970  and from 2000-06 indicated the desire to double the amount of land under woodland  in the North of Ireland by 2050 from its current 6% to 12%. In the past five  planting seasons, new woodland creation in the North of Ireland has fallen by  almost 50% to its lowest level, and it is below the target of 550 hectares per  annum. The new Bill needs to address that major shortfall, and I think that it  will.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Everyone with whom I discussed the Bill thought that the  clause that deals with the felling licence was a useful tool in forest  management. The private sector was concerned about the cost of felling licences  and stated that there was no requirement for fees linked to felling licences in  England, Scotland, Wales or the South of Ireland.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify that issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There were also reservations about the need for farmers and  woodland developers to draw up a management plan for all woodland/forestry  plantations. It was felt that that was an unnecessary obligation, given that  all plantings are undertaken only when grant approval has been agreed. That  grant approval process takes care of the development of long-term objectives,  so people were asking why there was a need for duplication.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Premier Woodlands is concerned that the Bill does not make  clear who the Forest Service is answerable to in the context of carrying out  its activities. Premier Wood&shy;lands believes that, as currently constituted, the  Bill gives the Forest Service free rein to carry out its activities on an  unscrutinised basis. I am sure that the Agriculture Committee and the Minister  will deal with that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Recreation and tourism access, including community  well-being, needs to be on a level footing with timber production. Local  communities need to be able to feel ownership of forests, and there is  potential for community groups and new councils to investigate working with the  Forest Service in building high-quality play parks for tourists and locals. I  welcome the opportunity for Forest Service land to be used for other reason,  including renewable energy, through wind farms, as well as the development of  tourist facilities. I would like to acknowledge the Minister&rsquo;s clarification  that log-cabin holiday accommodation will be included in the proposals.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">During recess, along with other interested parties, I  visited Yorkshire to investigate the potential  for the Forest Service to diversify into sporting provision and eco-holiday  provision. The Forest Service has taken great steps in relation to the  recreational provisions in our forests, but it is time to complete the journey.  The Bill has the potential to do that. Proposals are being developed in  relation to activity tourism on such measures as a high ropes project in  Tollymore and a high-profile development of mountain biking &mdash; a recreational  industry that has the potential to become a multi-million-pound success story.  It is being planned for the south Down forests. Those projects will complement  the tourism projects that are in place in south Down, the rest of the North and  the island in general.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I find it difficult to envisage how a long-term strategy  for forestry and woodlands in the North of Ireland can advance without  consideration of the impact of climate change and sustainable development. We  need to take a strategic approach to our forests and maximise their use to  combat climate change, be that through the planting of floodplains, for  instance. That would provide a good opportunity to alleviate problems of  flooding. I am interested in the Minister&rsquo;s thoughts on that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have spoken to the RSPB and the Woodland Trust, and they  are calling for the new legislation to ensure the protection of ancient  woodland, a resource that is particularly scarce in the North of Ireland. Both  organisations are also keen to see the promotion of biodiversity through a  sustainability duty that will encompass all state, public and private woodland.  In addition, they feel that such a duty should encourage the expansion of the  native woodland cover in the North of Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Perhaps the Minister will tell the House how the general  duty on the Department will enable the creation of new native woodland for  community and recreational access. Evidence has shown that increasing native wood&shy;land  cover can help to deliver on a range of policy issues, including climate change  and public health. Not only is native woodland rightly considered to be a  beautiful and relaxing backdrop, but those woods and trees support an array of  wildlife and bio-diversity. Therefore, native woods will assume a great  importance in delivering on Executive priorities such as the Programme for  Government targets of creating 1,650 hectares of new woodland by 2011 and  halting the loss of indigenous species and habitats by 2016.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 10 of the Bill deals with the removal of vegetation  close to forests. I see the need for that given the risks from gorse fires, the  bills for which regularly run into hundreds of thousands of pounds, especially  in my constituency of South Down.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, forests must become multi-functional; they  must be relevant to all of our lives; and many more people must be able to use  them for recreation and to earn a living. Forests must be developed to provide  renewable energy opportunities, and although timber production is essential,  the Forest Service must have flexibility, particularly in relation to social  use and recreation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill is the first piece of forestry legislation for 50  years, and it could give the Executive, its Departments and agencies the  legislative authority to deliver fit-for-purpose forestry management in an  ever-changing world. Together with the Agriculture Committee, I look forward to  working with the Department, the Forest Service and the Minister in progressing  the Bill. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I declare an interest as a farmer and the owner of a modest area of forest.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In broad terms, the Ulster Unionist Party welcomes progress  on a new Forestry Bill. The last Forestry Act dates back to 1953 and is much  outdated. Therefore, we are pleased that there will be some progress on that at  least. However, that does not mean that we are absolutely delighted with the  new Bill: we are pleased with some aspects of it, but, to be blunt, we will  seek changes and amendments in others.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Like Mr Willie Clarke and other Members, my party  colleagues and I met various stakeholders in the industry and forestry  officials during the summer recess. We thank those stakeholders for those  meetings and for making their time available.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are a number of issues that I want to deal with  specifically, the first of which is ancient woodland. I am concerned that the  Bill does not afford enough protection to ancient woodland. I do not know where  it even defines ancient woodland. Perhaps the Minister and the Forest Service  could clarify that aspect as the Bill progresses through its various Stages.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In her opening remarks, the Minister alluded to meeting the  objectives of the forestry strategy, but I am concerned that the Forest Service  is not even meeting the Programme for Government targets of planting an  additional 550 hectares of forest and woodland per year, and I hope that the  Bill can help to redress that issue. Another area of concern is the Forest  Service&rsquo;s overall target of doubling forest cover in Northern Ireland by 2050, which is  a huge task and, given the amount of new planting taking place, it is a target  that will never be met.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, I have noticed that the Department&rsquo;s replies  to questions in recent months have included short-term coppice in the figures  for newly planted woodland and forest, and I am not sure that it should be  included in that category.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am hugely concerned about the overall control that the  Bill will give to the Forest Service and the Department, because the Forest  Service is involved in the commercial production of timber, and it should not  have an advantage over private industry. I believe that the Bill will give the  Forest Service a huge advantage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If you will permit me, Mr Speaker, I will look at a couple  of issues, many of which the Committee will deal with; however, I want to  highlight one or two for the Minister&rsquo;s pursuance.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The first issue is the disposal of forestry land, and I assume  that there will need to be some sort of acceptance of the public interest in  such disposal. I also assume that the Forest Service cannot dispose of forestry  land if and when it so desires; if that is to be allowed, there would need to  be good reason that is in the public interest. I would like clarification on  that point.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My second point relates to clause 4, which deals with the  use or development of forestry land. Clause 4(1) states:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Department may use or develop forestry land for a  purpose other than forestry.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Does that mean that the Department will take that  land out of forestry use and develop it for use as something else? Clause 4(1)  is not clear about that, and I would like it to be clarified.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The compulsory acquisition of land puts the Forest Service  at a huge advantage over private industry. It allows it to take land off any  farmer or landowner that it so desires for its own purposes. That is dealt with  under clause 5, and if the provisions of that clause are combined with those of  clause 4, the Forest Service could develop forestry land for a purpose other  than forestry. That would give the Forest Service wide-ranging powers, and,  unless there is a good reason for it to acquire land, such powers are not  acceptable. Clause 5 should be narrowed to mean the compulsory acquisition only  for reasons of access to land, and if that were the situation, that power  should also be available to private landowners.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have huge concerns about clause 7, which deals with  incidental powers, and I must say, I wish that I had those powers at home.  Clause 7(1) states:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Department may do anything which appears to it to  be conducive or incidental to the discharge of its general duty under section  1(1).&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That gives the Department the power to do almost  anything. I would love to go home and tell my wife that sometimes, but the  problem is that she would just not listen. I would like some clarification on  that issue from the Forest Service.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is huge concern that the Bill will allow for the  Forest Service to control not only forest land, but adjoining land. That also  means lands that adjoin any forest, not just those that are under the  management of the Forest Service for the control of animals. That will create  huge problems for sporting and shooting organisations in the Province.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 14 deals with the felling licence. Although there  are reasons for having a felling licence, it must be subject to some  flexibility, particularly where the management plans are concerned. I have not  heard anything from the Department and the Forest Service that specifies  clearly what those management plans will entail. I am concerned about the fact  that the Forest Service will be immune from the need for such a management plan  and licence. Again, that puts the Forest Service at a huge advantage over the  private sector. The private sector will need a management plan to get a felling  licence but the Forest Service will not. There is great unfairness in that, and  it needs to be resolved quickly. I suggest that the Forest Service should also  need a management plan and felling licence and that there should be an external  audit group that could be overseen by people from the Forest Service and  private industry. I do not want to create additional bureaucracy, but that must  be looked at.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There has been no consultation with sporting organisations  or with those who have the sporting rights over forestry about pedestrian  access to all forestry and woodland. There must be genuine and proper  consultation on that matter because there could be huge conflict in that area.  We heard earlier about how much that industry brings into the Province, and we  must take cognisance of that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I look forward to going through the Committee Stage of the  Bill in conjunction with the Department. Obviously, I do not believe that we  will agree on everything at this stage, but I look forward to progressing the  matter.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  must first apologise to the House for the absence today of David Ford, who was  hoping to speak on the Bill, but whose mother-in-law sadly passed away last night.  I am sure that all our thoughts are with David at this time.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On behalf of the Alliance Party, I warmly welcome the  legislation, as well as the fact that, on the second day of the new Assembly  session, we are getting around to discussing legislation, which is, after all,  our primary purpose as MLAs. I certainly hope that we can do the subject  justice and have a debate as long as, if not longer than, the debates on  private Member&rsquo;s motions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill presents an important opportunity for Northern Ireland,  one that does not come along very often. The Bill is the first piece of  legislation in this area for some 56 years, since the Forestry Act (Northern  Ireland) 1953, and already there has been considerable consultation &mdash; in some  cases going back quite some time &mdash; leading up to the introduction of the Bill.  That shows how rare an opportunity it is to progress that type of work.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party will certainly support the Second Stage  of the Bill, because we need to take the matter forward. Although we welcome  large aspects of the legislation, it is only right to say that there are a  number of deficiencies in the Bill as presented. We look forward to those  issues being addressed, either during Committee Stage or, if necessary, in the  Chamber through the amendment process.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am particularly grateful for the comments and input from  the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and the Woodland Trust. Both  organisations have been extremely active on behalf of the community in Northern Ireland  in protecting our natural environment, and we all owe them a great debt of  gratitude for their ongoing work.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The management of our woodland is clearly a critical issue.  Ian Paisley Jnr has already spoken of the balance between the economic, social  and environ&shy;mental aspects. It is also worth stressing the importance of the  contribution of forestry to tackling climate change. The Minister has already  alluded to the fact that Northern    Ireland is poorly wooded; some 6% of our  land mass is covered by trees. It is useful to compare that figure with the  figures internationally: in the rest of the UK,  the figure is around 12%; in the Republic  of Ireland, it is 10%; and in the rest  of Europe, it is, on average, around 44%. When  one considers ancient woodland in particular, those figures appear even worse. Northern Ireland is in an even more difficult  position, as only around 0&middot;6% of our land mass is covered by ancient woodland,  compared to around 2% in the rest of the United Kingdom.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The casual visitor can see the different levels of tree  cover when flying over the countryside of different parts of the world. Having  travelled through the north-east of the United States, for example, I was  struck by the fact that virtually every small town and village is obscured by a  canopy of trees. That adds to both the built and natural environment there, and  is something that we should aspire to here. The historical evolution of these  islands has been very different to that, and there tends to be a lot more open  countryside, but perhaps we can address that over time. In the past, as Members  have mentioned, the emphasis has been on the regulation of timber supply. It is  clear that the emphasis now needs to change to sustainability, which should be  front and centre in the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will now make some specific comments on the Bill. Clause  1 outlines the general duties on the Department. It is important that a clear  duty is included in the legislation to ensure sustainability in relation to  forestry policy and practice and the regulation of all woodland types. That  should apply not only to forests that are in public ownership but to private  land. It should also be cross-referenced with biodiversity. The issue is not  simply the trees that are being managed, but the wildlife that exists in our  forests, both flora and fauna. The Bill should make very clear references to  things like the UK  biodiversity plan.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with Tom Elliott&rsquo;s comments that some of the  terminology used in the legislation is somewhat vague. Perhaps that terminology  can be spelt out more clearly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Careful consideration needs to be given to the compulsory  acquisition powers that are set out in clause 5. No doubt something is required  in that area, but great sensitivity is necessary, and we also must respect  people&rsquo;s property rights.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the intention regarding inquiries and information  in clause 6. However, the tenor of that clause should be one of &ldquo;shall&rdquo; rather  than &ldquo;may&rdquo;. There should be a requirement for information gathering, rather  than simply a hope that it will happen. Indeed, any information that is  gathered should be made publicly available.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Arising from that point, I must stress the need for a  proper inventory to be taken of the woodland in Northern Ireland. We would like the  Bill to include a statutory duty on the Forest Service to survey and monitor  the extent and condition of all Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s woodland &mdash; that is an essential  requirement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We appreciate that a certain degree of information on the  extent and location of forests, woodland and trees in Northern Ireland  is already available, but, in some respects, data can be rather disparate and  out of date, and there are gaps in the coverage. The Forest Service probably  knows what is in its estate, but it is with what lies outside its estate where  much of the difficulty arises.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is worth pointing out that holding proper inventories is  the case in the rest of the UK, the Republic of Ireland and most of Europe, so  Northern Ireland&rsquo;s current approach is out of step in that wider context. It is  worth highlighting that the Forestry Commission of Great Britain has  recommended such an inventory for Northern Ireland and regards it as  being essential.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The fundamental point is that we cannot measure our  progress, particularly on the protection of ancient woodlands, if we do not  have baselines and do not know from where we are starting. Therefore, taking an  inventory to establish where we are starting from is critical if this  legislation is to have credibility. The Minister has acknowledged that those  limitations exist, but the challenge for her is to follow up on her words and  commit fully to taking a proper inventory.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 7, to which Mr Elliott also referred, covers  incidental powers. In any exercising of those powers, the Bill should contain a  very clear sustainability duty.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the clauses on the felling of trees, but, at this  stage, I want to stress three points. First, there should be a presumption  against granting a felling licence for ancient woodlands; the bar for granting  one should be set extremely high. Secondly, the Forest Service should not be  exempt from the need to request a felling licence. As things stand, who is  there to police the Forest Service? That is an important and necessary safeguard.  Thirdly, I am somewhat sceptical of the need for compensation should a felling  licence be refused. We need to shift our priorities from the traditional notion  of our economy more towards the protection of the environment. I must again  stress that the concept of sustainability means that, as far as I am concerned,  the protection of the environment and the economic development of Northern Ireland  go hand in hand.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We on these Benches would welcome some stake&shy;holder  advisory input on the way forward for the regulation of practice and policy.  Although we consider the Bill to be a good start, the opportunity with which we  are presented should be seen as a platform on which we can build. I look  forward to the Bill&rsquo;s being improved as it goes through its various Stages, and  we are happy to support the Bill&rsquo;s Second Stage.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr W McCrea</strong>:  I realise that the Bill is at Second Stage, so we are undertaking a general  review rather than going into all the detail.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although it is true that the Minister has outlined the  Department&rsquo;s emphasis in respect of most of the clauses, we need to ensure that  those matters that we identify as deficiencies will be gone into in depth  during the Bill&rsquo;s Committee Stage. That is, of course, what Committees are  engaged to do. The Committee will engage with the Department in seeking to  tease out some of those deficiencies, as well as those things that we believe  need to be put right.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The explanatory and financial memorandum to the proposed  Forestry Bill states that the general duty of the Department is:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;to promote forestry on a wider footing than the  traditional primary role of developing afforestation, the supply of timber, and  the maintenance of reserves of growing trees.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">In addition, the explanatory memorandum states that  the Bill:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;places equal importance on protection of the  environment and social and recreational use.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I appreciate that that is laid out as a general  principle. However, many are concerned that lip service is being paid more than  dealing with the issues, because the Bill seems to have more to do with the regulatory  powers that are being given to the Department, rather than tackling many of the  issues that the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development will, clearly,  identify.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It has been emphasised to me that the monetary, health,  educational and environmental benefits need to be clearly identified and taken  account of. We need not only identify the issues but how we move them forward  in a specific way. Many consultees welcome the broad basis of the Bill but are  concerned that the commercial production of timber is still, in the  Department&rsquo;s eyes, the primary benefit of forestry. I understand that the  Woodland Trust made a statement to the Committee emphasising that the primary  function should be the promotion of sustainable forest management, and that the  social and environmental value of forestry must be accorded equal importance to  commercial production. Therefore, the Bill must strike a balance between  commercial concerns and all the other issues that we have identified.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will not go into all the issues today, clause by clause,  and I am sure that everyone will be delighted about that. I, as a member of the  Committee, will have the opportunity to go through the Bill, clause by clause,  during its Committee Stage. However, we have to lay down certain parameters and  state clearly that the amount of woodland in Northern   Ireland compared with the rest of the United Kingdom or the rest of Europe  is unacceptable. It is vital that we ensure real protection for our ancient  woodlands, but we must also ensure that we have a process and a specific  programme to realise the desire for more tree-planting and more woodland in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That aspiration is one thing, but how do we take that  forward? The Department desires to double the woodland in Northern Ireland.  Yet, until now, all the Department&rsquo;s efforts in that respect have totally  failed. Therefore, we must ensure that something is done and a programme is  outlined that will take us to that vision. It is important that we protect  endangered ancient woodland, and that we not only aspire to have more woodland  but establish a programme by which we can achieve that, and measure our  progress along the way, because it will take time. If we are going somewhere,  we have to see how well we are progressing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 4 of the Bill is entitled &ldquo;Use or development of  forestry land&rdquo;. Paragraph 4 of the explanatory and financial memorandum states  that that clause will provide a power for the Department:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;to develop its land to obtain better value from the  public estate &mdash; for example to allow for the creation of wind farms or the  development of tourist facilities on forestry land.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development  received excellent information from the RSPB, the Woodland Trust, Farm  Woodlands Ltd and the district councils. We are thankful that those bodies are  actively engaged in considering the Bill, and we must keep them engaged. The  Committee was told that the Department&rsquo;s powers, as outlined in clause 4,  should be subject to planning laws. I want the Minister to consider that to see  how the Department will be subject to planning laws.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 5, which deals with the compulsory acquisition of  land, is widely drafted. I am always concerned about giving Departments wide,  sweeping powers, because, in the past, I have found that they use such powers  and push them to the limit. The Minister will know that the Committee for  Agriculture and Rural Development always seeks to ensure that the power of the  Executive and of Departments is restricted. It seems that any powers that are  granted are used very quickly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Ballymena Borough Council said that landowners should have  the right of appeal in regard to that power. When a Department is granted the  power of compulsory acquisition of land, people wonder whether they own  anything. With such powers, Departments can tell people what to do with their  own land, and people find that they do not really own anything and that the  Department has more interest in the land than the landowner.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The control of animals in forests is an important aspect of  the Bill, and it was drawn to the Committee&rsquo;s attention that the Forest Service  has to control the vermin in state forests. Will the Forest Service and the  Department be included in legislation to control wild animals and vermin that  might attack and undermine forest on their land so that it is not only farmers  who have to do so? The Department should lead by example in what it is  enforcing on ordinary farmers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Dr Farry mentioned the felling of trees. I agree that it is  important that the Bill should include a presumption against felling in ancient  woodlands. We must ensure that we protect the ancient woodlands. If we  acknowledge the fact that we have little enough woodland in Northern Ireland  and that ancient woodland is part of our heritage, we should do everything in  our power to protect it. Clause 14 concerns the requirement for a licence for  felling trees, and the Department should also come under that legislation.  Protection must be in place not only from unscrupulous persons who would fell  trees but to prevent the Department from felling trees for monetary gain.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Farm Woodlands Ltd raised concerns about the possible  length of time to process applications for a licence. It also disagreed with  the requirement for a management plan for private forestry. If it is right to  have a management plan for private forestry, should the Forest Service also be  required to have a management plan to fell trees? That is another issue that  was raised in response to the Committee&rsquo;s request for the community to make its  voice heard.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am concerned about the proposed unlimited power of entry.  I have major concerns about granting that power to the Department. I also have  concerns about infringement of adjoining land rights. It must be ensured that  the rights of farmers on adjoining land are acknowledged as much as those of  the Department.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It ought to be said that much of the Bill is welcome. It  takes forward the provisions of the previous Act, which is long out of date.  That is important. However, I make a simple appeal to the Department to ensure  that, during the passage of the Bill, it continues to engage with people who  have a keen interest and who have taken the time to return information to the  Committee, including those who represent bodies that I mentioned earlier, such  as the Woodland Trust, the RSPB, district councils and Farm Woodlands Ltd. The Committee  will do likewise. In the end, we must ensure that the final Bill will take  forestry to an advanced stage and, in years to come, will leave a heritage for  the next generation of which we can be proud.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Doherty</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I welcome the Second Stage of the  Forestry Bill. During the debate, it has been mentioned a few times that it is  56 years since the Forestry Act 1953 was passed. It is slightly younger than  me. At that time, forestry was simply a matter of growing trees, cutting and  selling them. The Bill is much more expansive than that. Of course, it includes  that basic facet of forestry; however, it also covers its potential for  tourism, recreation, wind farms and so on. The Bill has a strong environ&shy;mental  and social aspect, which is welcome. However, there will be areas of concern,  one of which I will mention. During the past year or so, the Committee, the  Minister and the Department have developed a good, solid working relationship  whereby we can raise deep concerns with the Department, it will respond, and we  end up dealing with those issues. I am sure that we will be able to do that as  we progress through Committee and the Bill&rsquo;s various stages.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to flag up a particular area of concern so that the  Department and the Minister can consider it. Often, forestry is carried out in  remote areas where the roads infrastructure is just about sufficient to service  local communities and their farming needs. Suddenly &mdash; not even every year, as  it occurs only now and again &mdash; trees are felled and massive, heavy lorries  converge on those small country roads. I want the Department to respond to that  and potentially to develop a protocol with Roads Service as to how those roads  are maintained during such phases and repaired when that work is finished. In  those areas, that can cause huge difficulties for local farming communities and  rural dwellers in general.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I would like the Minister to deal with that issue in her  response to the debate and throughout the Bill&rsquo;s various developments. I am  sure that all matters will be dealt with in the thorough manner to which the  Committee has recently become accustomed.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Irwin</strong>: I  welcome the opportunity to comment on the important Bill that is before the  House. The previous Member to speak mentioned that the Forestry Act (Northern Ireland)  1953 was passed 56 years ago. That was a long time ago, before my time.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s forests are a cherished part of  the landscape. They provide great amenity space for thousands of people each  year. The Province&rsquo;s tourism industry also relies heavily on its various  accessible and well-known forest parks. In presenting the Bill, I believe that  the Department wants to improve the overall conditions of those forests, which  will be to everyone&rsquo;s betterment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the Bill shows, the forestry industry is more than just  a reserve of timber. As the importance of leisure and amenity space grows, so  does the public&rsquo;s use of forest parks. Likewise, as environmental issues gain  prominence, the need to maintain forests and increase tree cover becomes more  important. Amenity space and facilities are dealt with in clause 3, and the  Depart&shy;ment could do much more to make greater use of forest parks to the  benefit of tourism.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In my district council area, a number of forest   park areas have been utilised, such as Gosford forest park in Markethill and Clare Glen, to  great effect for caravan owners. However, I ask that there is greater focus, on  a Province-wide basis, on improving amenity spaces by making them bigger and by  improving the facilities on offer.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am concerned about the compulsory acquisition of land  that is mentioned in clause 5. In my role as a public representative, I have  come across vesting issues in which constituents have come to me for advice.  One thing is always clear: the vesting of land is a very traumatic experience  for landowners who cherish the land that they have worked for many years.  Although I acknowledge that the full right of appeal will be available to the  landowner in any vesting procedure, I ask that caution be exercised in any  attempt to use such powers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill refers to the traditional function of the  development of afforestation. Forest cover in Northern Ireland stands at around  6%. How the Department moves forward to increase forest cover will be complex  as the area of suitable land available and the population density are factors  in how targets for increasing woodland cover are worked out.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The spread of rural dwellings and the  small-in-size-but-large-in-number nature of farm holdings reduce the  opportunity for large-scale forestation in Northern Ireland in comparison with  our European neighbours. As I have stated in a previous debate, Northern Ireland is a compact land mass in  comparison with Great    Britain and other EU countries.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Forest Service is on record as stating that it will be  trying to improve opportunities for grant-aided woodland expansion. It is  through grant-aided schemes that, I feel, the Forest Service will have the best  chance of encouraging landowners to consider tree-planting. However, I do not  believe for one moment that doubling the area of woodland is achievable. With  an ever-growing population across the world, food is becoming increasingly  important, and that may dictate the use of land in future. The situation is  changing, and a certain amount of flexibility must be built into the Bill to  account for changes in how land is utilised.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Bill. However, the Committee will have much  to discuss about how the Bill will affect and shape the future of forests in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>: I  broadly support the Bill, which represents the long overdue reform of the  Forestry Act (Northern    Ireland) 1953. That Act reflects a past  priority to establish a strategic reserve of timber and maintain a timber  supply in Northern Ireland.  For a long time, my party has been calling for elements that are contained in  the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">With that in mind, I strongly support those aspects of the  Bill that seek to protect the environment and encourage the enjoyment of land  by the public. However, I am concerned that, in the Bill, the duty on the  Forest Service to sustainably protect native woodland and the biodiversity that  it supports is not strong enough. There is a greater need for sustainability  criteria in the Bill, and that must be examined in Committee.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In bringing forward the legislation, the Department rightly  recognises that forestry is now a complex and multifaceted enterprise, with  increasing economic, social and environmental purposes and benefits. The  Department endorses the view that the Forest Service needs to move with the  times in order to maximise the benefits of the public estate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to further qualify my support for the Bill by making  some observations about items that caused my colleagues and me some concern.  From a commercial forestry standpoint, the overarching concern is that the Bill  gives too much power to the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development and  the Forest Service with no meaningful checks and balances.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Regulatory and compulsory purchasing powers are being  acquired, held and exercised by an agency that also owns and operates a  monopoly over publicly owned forests. In light of the percentage of forested  land that the Forest Service owns and the percentage of timber production that  it is involved in, there is a real danger of market implications for the  private forestry industry in Northern    Ireland.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">From an environmental point of view, the overarching  concern is that the Bill does not place a strict enough duty on the Forest  Service to protect native ancient woodland and biodiversity or to manage  forests in a sustainable manner. Concerns have also been raised about powers  that the Department may give to the Forest Service that will allow it to cull  any animal on forestry land or adjoining land that poses a threat to forestry.  That will exempt the Forest Service from wildlife protection, hunting  guidelines and other legislation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are many issues that we could talk about, but there  is nothing in the Bill to indicate how the Forest Service will double forest  cover by 2050. Forest Service policy suggests a development with the private  market. However, there are convincing arguments that suggest that current grant  schemes will not deliver the required development. That raises a certain level  of concern in the long term about the Forest Service&rsquo;s compulsory purchase  power. Those matters need considerable examination and resolution during the  Bill&rsquo;s various stages. The implementation of appropriate safeguards would have  a big impact on the future of the Forest Service.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the Bill. I also ask the Forest Service to think  seriously about the large amount of open space in high areas of our community,  which could play a big part in the production of forestry in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I, too, welcome the opportunity to speak in the debate on the Bill. I had the  privilege of being born and reared in Derrymore in the townland of the  Montiaghs. The Minister may know that Doire M&oacute;r translates as the &ldquo;big oak  tree&rdquo; and that seven Doires make a Montiagh. Woodland was very much a feature of the  landscape and provided many of the names for our local areas and roads, many of  which are still used.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, the Plantation of Ulster led to the ravage  of Ulster, and much of our  woodland was felled and shipped across to England  to fuel smelting in the iron furnaces that adorned Stratford-upon-Avon.  Therefore, it falls to the Minister to set out a vision and a strategy for the  next 50 years to replace some of what we have lost and to go beyond that. The  Forestry Bill is welcome, although there are some amendments that should be  looked at. In their contributions this afternoon, many Members referred to  those amendments.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>:  Does the Member agree that people have shown great affection for our trees,  even to the point of hugging them? Does she agree that the Forest Service  should not have sole responsibility for the targets and that other Departments,  particularly the Department of Education, have a major role to play in  encouraging our young people to show the same affection for our trees as some  of our leaders?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I agree with the bid that the Member made for the involvement of the Department  of Education. I am sure that the Minister will not take the approach of her  party president and run about hugging trees and telling people that all will be  well. I hope that she will demonstrate her intentions in the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill must also look at sustainable development and the  promotion of biodiversity in state, public and private woodland. It should also  encourage the expansion of Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s woodland cover in line with the  Forest Service&rsquo;s existing commitments. The Minister said that there is a  commitment to move from 6% cover to 12% cover. Perhaps she can define what that  means in acreage so that we can get an idea of what our base is.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In bringing forward the final legislation, it would also be  helpful if the Minister would consider setting up a stakeholder advisory  committee, similar to those that exist elsewhere. In that way, the  organisations and individuals with expert advice to give and a vision for the  future can help to develop sustainable forest management policy, regulation and  practice. I would be grateful if the Minister could give us her thoughts on  that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I concur with the Members who talked about the woodland  survey and monitoring requirement. That is something that we need to take  cognisance of. I come from the Craigavon area, where, to this day, vesting is a  very sore point among many whose lands were vested and taken from them, so any  vesting powers in the legislation will have to be very sensitively dealt with  through very clear guidelines. Land vesting cannot be done on a whim; it has to  demonstrate how we are going to improve, whether economically or socially. The  other side of the coin is the impact that any such vesting would have on  biodiversity and sustainable development.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the principle laid out in clause 6, under which  research will be carried out in respect of the wider social and economic  benefits of forestry. Information gathered should be freely available to all  stakeholders. Perhaps the Minister might give some thought to publishing that  research on the Department&rsquo;s website, particularly if we want to engage the  wider public in the debate on the protection of our woodlands.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is not good enough that other state agencies,  authorities and Departments might be exempt from the requirement to hold a fell  licence. That is another amendment that the Minister might wish to consider.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the fact that the Bill is before us. It is good  to see that at least some legislation is coming to the House at the start of  the session. I hope that the Minister sets challenging targets for sustainable  development because, as many know, we are here for only a very short time, and  we have to protect the environment.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  We are here for four years.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Perhaps less in some case, which might be a godsend for some members of the  public.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When it comes to sustainable development, we are very much  the custodians of the land. We have to take a carrot-and-stick approach. It is  all very well to have regulations and prohibition notices, but we must recognise  the hard work of farmers and the fact that, over the years, many farmers have  been the custodians of our land services. We have to help farmers and other  landholders to protect and enhance our environment.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I must interrupt proceedings. I ask the House to take its ease until we move  into Question Time at 3.00 pm.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The debate stood suspended.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Speaker in the Chair)</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenAnswersHeading"><a name="5"></a>Oral Answers to Questions</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName" style="margin-top:17.0pt;"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: I remind Members, if they need reminding, that they  must continually rise in their place &mdash; the word &ldquo;continually&rdquo; is important &mdash; if  they wish to ask a supplementary question.</p>
    <p class="H3SectionHeading">Social Development</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Housing Executive Grants</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Ms S  Ramsey </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development if she has intervened in  any cases where people have been turned down for housing renovation and  disability grants, and if so, how many were overturned due to her intervention  in the South Down constituency in 2008-09.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  31/10<a name="AQO3110"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development (Ms Ritchie)</strong>: The short answer is that I did not  intervene in any cases in which people were turned down for private grants in  South Down in 2008-09. I am disappointed by the implied suggestion in the  question that I might have used ministerial authority to ensure that my South  Down constituency was given preferential treatment over others.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members are aware of the shortfall in the housing budget,  which has affected the delivery of certain housing programmes. In particular,  the level of funding for home improvements in the private sector is insufficient,  and applications for discretionary renovation, replacement and home repairs  assistance grants are now unlikely to be approved, save in exceptional  circumstances.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The disabled facilities grant scheme is, of course,  unaffected. I have received many representations about that scheme, several of  which were made by colleagues here, on behalf of constituents. I have also  received numerous representations from members of the public about individual  applications. I have looked into and responded to each and every one of those  representations. I have not, however, intervened in any cases that resulted in  the overturning of decisions taken by the Housing Executive. Since it was not  necessary for the Housing Executive to refuse or cancel applications that were  made in 2008-09, it is a fact that no such enquiries were made to my office  during that period, although that was the case subsequently, because of  budgetary problems.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have done my utmost to protect the most vulnerable  households by ring-fencing budgets for new social housing to help those who are  in housing stress. In fact, the Member may be interested to know that in the  past two years, 236 new social housing units have been started in her  constituency, costing almost &pound;38 million.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, Mr Speaker. I thank the Minister for her honest answer,  but I do not know why she is disappointed. I am entitled to ask questions in  the House when people raise issues with me. The reason I asked the question was  to get to the bottom of some of those issues. I am glad that the Minister gave  that answer; maybe it will put a lot of rumours to bed. Can the Minister tell  me how many decisions were overturned last year and this year?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I do not have those figures to hand; I will write to  the Member with that information. However, bearing in mind the &pound;100 million  shortfall in the housing budget this year, it is important that all Members  join the campaign, along with the Ministers who represent their parties, to  ensure that, once and for all, housing is put on a sound financial footing and  that capital receipts are decoupled from the overall housing budget. The  Executive inherited that situation from the direct rule Administration, and it  must be rectified urgently.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  The Minister will be aware that people in the neighbouring constituency of  Strangford are having difficulties with the disabled facilities grant scheme.  Does she know that there is a three-year waiting list for those grants in my  constituency? I am sure that she is endeavouring to address that situation.  Will she confirm that the concerns of people who are on that list will be  addressed, and that there will be a greater emphasis, as she has said before,  on making those grants available, and specifically in the Strangford area?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: Disabled facilities grants can be divided into two  types: mandatory, which are not affected by the scheme, and concern internal  alterations to houses; and discretionary, which are affected because of the  &pound;100 million shortfall in the housing budget.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In deciding the housing budget for this year, I was given a  certain pot, with which I decided to protect the vulnerable. I am sure that no  one in the House would disagree with that. The vulnerable are those who are  homeless or in housing stress, hence the protection of money for newbuild;  those who are vulnerable because of fuel poverty, hence the protection of  funding for the warm homes scheme, and those who are in institutions or in the  community and who may not be well. It is important to protect people through  the Supporting People programme in order to ensure that they can remain in the  community, with the support of family and friends, instead of being admitted to  an institution.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member raised another fundamental issue, and I urge him  to have further discussions with the Minister of Finance and Personnel. I was  very grateful for the &pound;20 million capital allocation that was made in June, but  that simply deals with what is already in the pipeline. We still need financial  assistance to cover the shortfall in order to deal with the people in the  pipeline.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I instructed the Housing Executive to ensure that nobody  lost his or her place in the queue because of the lack of finance for  improvement grants. As soon as money becomes available, those grants will be  dealt with: money will flow to them. It is important that housing is put on a  sound financial footing so that those problems can be rectified.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Remember, there is not one person in the House or in the  community who is responsible for the economic downturn: it has beset us  globally. However, the one budget that has been deeply affected by the downturn  is the housing budget. That must be rectified as a matter of urgency. The  Member&rsquo;s good offices with his Minister for Finance and his ministerial  colleagues in the DUP would be greatly appreciated.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr PJ Bradley</strong>:  I was also curious about the question about South Down. Now that I have heard  Ms Ramsey&rsquo;s contribution, I am doubly confused as to why people with queries  about South Down are going to a representative in Belfast.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister advise the Assembly on how the Executive  can make good the overall shortfall in the housing budget without having to cut  expenditure on other services?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I advise the Member to read the SDLP document &lsquo;New  Priorities in Difficult Times&rsquo;. In that document, the party has set out where  more money should be spent in areas such as housing, renewable energy and  upskilling, as well as stating where the money should come from. It is a unique  document and an important contribution to the economic debate. I understand  that the Ulster Unionist Party has also published a document highlighting where  money should come from.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">For my part, I have suggested measures such as the  reprofiling of the Housing Executive&rsquo;s debt, the sale and leasing back of  assets, and other measures to free up additional funding without necessitating  cuts to services. However, such initiatives require the approval of the  Department of Finance and Personnel.</p>
    <p class="H5StageHeading">Social Housing</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr Lunn </strong>asked  the Minister for Social Development to outline the anticipated need for  newbuild social housing for (i) the remainder of the 2009-2010 financial year;  and (ii) the 2010-11 financial year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  32/10<a name="AQO3210"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: Housing need is a continuum. It would not be very  insightful if I were to reply in the context of a single year; the figures must  be taken across several years.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The most recent social housing needs assessment by the  Housing Executive shows that there is a regional requirement for 3,000 new  social housing units each year; that is year-on-year for the foreseeable  future. The Executive have been unable to provide that quantum of resources for  housing investment. With the budgets available to me, I plan to provide 1,750  new homes this financial year, and 2,000 in the financial year 2010-11.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There have, nonetheless, been significant increases compared  to recent years, when an average of only 1,250 houses were started. I have made  the increased supply of housing my priority. I will continue to lobby Executive  colleagues for additional funding in order to put housing on a firm financial  footing once and for all.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her answer. Indeed, she has anticipated my supplementary  question well. Can she advise whether the Housing Executive has funds to  purchase lands at Ballymacoss in Lisburn and complete a social housing project  for 160 new homes?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Is that in South Down? <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I am glad that Ballymacoss is not in South Down, but I  am aware of the case. Discussions are ongoing, and, when I return to the  Department, I will check on the situation between the Department, the Housing  Executive and Lisburn Borough Council. I have received representations on the  matter from Members of the House and from members of Lisburn Borough Council.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her answer. The Minister will recall that, on several  occasions, I have asked about social housing projects in Monkstown in my  constituency. Can the Minister assure me that those projects are on target  despite the budgetary constraints?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I hope that a fair proportion of houses will be built  in various locations throughout Northern    Ireland. I say again that I would be very  grateful for the support of all Members to ensure that housing is put on a  sound financial footing, as that would ensure that we can deliver the  best-quality housing to those who deserve it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. What discussion has the Minister had  with the credit union movement regarding the proposal that it brought to the  Executive and the Department for Social Development to work alongside her and  help to finance the social housing project?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank Ms McCann for her question. I met the credit union  movement several months ago and was given detail on its thinking on the matter.  The credit union movement subsequently met officials and was advised that it  should submit a proposal if it wished to continue with the plan. I understand  that no proposal has been forthcoming, although the credit union movement is  due to meet Department of Finance and Personnel officials shortly. I want to  encourage as much financial innovation in housing as possible. I was surprised  by the comments of certain Sinn F&eacute;in representatives, which were reported in  local newspapers, to the effect that I may have rejected a proposal from the  credit union movement. Suffice to say, I welcome all proposals. All proposals  will be duly assessed, but we need to receive them first.</p>
    <p class="H5StageHeading">Housing Executive Grants</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Mr  Buchanan </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development when she proposes to  allocate funding to the Housing Executive&rsquo;s grants department to allow  applications awaiting approval to be released.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  33/10<a name="AQO3310"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I welcomed the Executive&rsquo;s release of &pound;20 million in  June, which was made available for social housing in the last monitoring round.  Fifteen million pounds has been allocated to private-sector grants and &pound;5  million to disabled adaptations. That additional funding will cover only  existing commitments on private-sector grants and limited approvals for grants  in cases where exceptional circumstances have arisen in-year. Additional  funding is required to cover those grants, and a bid was submitted in the  September monitoring round to cover the shortfall. I personally ensured that  the Housing Executive held the details on file of people whose grants were  cancelled or refused and wrote to them to explain what will happen if  additional funding becomes available.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I would like to clear the pipeline of grant applications,  because I have great sympathy for all those who find themselves in such  difficulties; indeed, I would like to reopen the grant scheme to new  applications. However, a significant injection of additional funds is required  to do that. We will be debating the issue, presumably in less than an hour, and  I look forward to the Member&rsquo;s contribution.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  First, I must tell the Minister that, unfortunately, I will not be present for  the debate on home improvement grants, because I have another meeting to  attend.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the fact that disabled facilities grants have  been ring-fenced. I have heard the Minister say much about social housing. The  Housing Executive has identified houses that are eligible for grants for  replacement dwellings, but they are sitting in the system now and cannot be  progressed. Does she not agree that such houses form part of social housing? As  far as I am concerned, they do. She, however, is not investing the money to  allow the grants to be released and the replacement dwellings progressed.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: Mr Buchanan and I discussed that subject yesterday in  the corridor. He makes a fair point, and I have great sympathy for people who  find themselves in that predicament having applied for grants for improvement,  home-repairs assistance or renovation. However, my point is that the shortfall  of &pound;100 million in the housing budget means that my Department can deal only  with its existing commitments. I need the support of all Members, and I suggest  that Mr Buchanan have a word with his colleague the Minister of Finance and  Personnel and other DUP Ministers about putting housing on a sound financial  footing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Given that we are talking about that subject, I must  mention that I have seen documentation that was republished yesterday. It  suggested that I diverted funding from grants to the social housing development  programme. I put on record that that is totally untrue. All I did was protect  the vulnerable in Northern    Ireland. Would the House not expect me to do  so?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat. I thank the Minister for her answer. Perhaps she will  clarify something for me. I thought that, when answering question 1, the  Minister said that she had instructed her Department to ensure that no one  waiting for home improvements or adaptation should lose his or her place in the  queue. However, when responding to Tom Buchanan, she outlined a criterion of  exceptional circumstances. I raise the point specifically because I speak as an  elected representative who has been inundated with queries from constituents.  By vulnerable people, I mean elderly, and particularly disabled, residents  whose applications for vital home improvements and adaptations have been  refused or suspended.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Certain people, whose applications were originally  approved, subsequently spent a considerable amount of money on planning  applications and surveys, only to be told that the process had been suspended.  I am not sure whether those people now satisfy that criterion of exceptional  circumstances. Alternatively, are they still on the waiting list? If so, will  they keep their place on that list?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: Ms Anderson&rsquo;s question contains two separate issues.  First, exceptional circumstances relate to the level of a property&rsquo;s structural  disrepair. If the Member, as a public representative, tells the Housing  Executive that she believes that a level of structural disrepair in a  particular property has been previously disregarded by a Housing Executive  inspector, that house can be reassessed and a recommendation made to the  committee that deals with the criterion of exceptional circumstances.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The second part of the Member&rsquo;s question relates to all  those who have been sent letters stating that their applications cannot be  dealt with at present because of the lack of financial assistance. To be  honest, having realised that those letters were slightly harsh, I instructed  the Housing Executive to ensure that no one lost his or her place in the queue.  Why did I do that? I did it to ensure that, when the money becomes available,  those people will not lose their place in the queue and that the money will  flow to them as it should have done originally.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, we come back to the very kernel of the debate:  everybody in this House, particularly those who have Ministers who sit round  the Executive table with me, should ensure that they support me in my quest to  have housing put on a sound financial footing. I have no doubt that that would  enable all our constituents and all the people of Northern Ireland to be dealt with  in a fair and equitable manner, and for them to have access to a good standard  of housing.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her response. There have been a number of cases in  which people have been left out of pocket &mdash; I think that that is what Ms  Anderson referred to earlier &mdash; because they have had to commission a structural  engineer, in cases where there is a replacement dwelling, or an architect. What  measures are in place to compensate those people for that out-of-pocket  expenditure that they necessarily incurred as part of their application  process?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank Mr McGlone for his question. I am very clear  about this. I understand that quite a number of people have been left out of  pocket because of their grant applications. That means people who have had to  use architects, consulting engineers and various other types of consultants in  order get their application for grant aid processed. Coupled with that is the  application for planning permission for the replacement house.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to help those people. As a result, I have asked my officials  to look again at that particular issue because the current statutory provision  that enables the Housing Executive to recompense expenses that are incurred by  applicants is quite specific, in that such fees are only recoverable if the  grant is approved and the works are satisfactorily completed. I realised that  there was a little problem that we needed to address, so I asked my officials  to have a look at the issue. It may be possible to provide help for some  applicants who have reached the latter stages of the grant-approval process and  whose grant would have been approved had money been available in relation to  the costs that they have incurred directly as a result of advancing their  application, such as fees for architects, planning consultants or civil  engineers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, the proposition requires more work before the  scheme can be launched. I am working on it, because there are certain details  that I have yet to finalise with officials, but I will be happy to come back to  the Member when that is fully completed.</p>
    <p class="H5StageHeading">Warm Homes Scheme</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mr  Armstrong </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development for her assessment of  the effectiveness of the warm homes scheme in the current financial year.&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 34/10<a name="AQO3410"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: The warm homes scheme is my Department&rsquo;s main programme  in tackling fuel poverty, and I remain committed to alleviating fuel poverty in  Northern Ireland.  As the Member knows, the scheme has been extremely successful and hugely  popular. Since 2001, we have spent over &pound;118 million on the warm homes scheme,  making over 71,000 homes warmer. The scheme was subject to a Northern Ireland  Audit Office review and a subsequent Public Accounts Committee hearing.  Following a series of recommendations, which I welcomed, changes were made to  ensure that money was targeted at those people who were most in need of help to  improve the energy efficiency of their homes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Following a competitive tendering process, the new warm  homes scheme contract was awarded on 1 July; H &amp; A Mechanical Services  Limited and Bryson Charitable Group are the new scheme managers. I am pleased  to say that, for the first time, young families who are in receipt of working  tax credit can now benefit from improvements to the heating systems in their  homes. I encourage Members to advise them to contact the new scheme managers.  People who are over 60 can also benefit from the scheme. I encourage Members to  advise their older constituents to apply to the scheme.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Despite enormous budgetary pressures, I have increased this  year&rsquo;s warm homes scheme budget to &pound;20&middot;5 million, and I have set a public  service agreement target in this financial year of 10,000 homes to be assisted  by the scheme. I expect that target to be met.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Armstrong</strong>:  Is the Minister content with the progress that her Department&rsquo;s has made in  meeting the fuel poverty commitment that is in the Programme for Government?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: My Department, with the Housing Executive and the other  stakeholders that are involved, has done a sterling job. What would have been  the case if we had not implemented a warm homes scheme? What would have been  the case if we had not issued 167,000 households with a fuel poverty payment  earlier this year? What would have been the case if I had been unable to enable  last year&rsquo;s increase in the winter fuel payment from &pound;25 to &pound;100? Hopefully, I  will be able to do that this year. Therefore, we are addressing fuel poverty,  and I hope that I will be able to address energy efficiency in all the homes in  question as a result of the revised warm homes scheme.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle. Do applicants who applied and were knocked back  under the Eaga scheme have to reapply now? Will the new applications cover new  central heating systems in new projects?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I assure Mr Molloy that those who have applied already  to Eaga will not have to reapply, because the two scheme managers have been  told that they must address what is in the pipeline. They are contacting  everybody who is on the waiting list, and I have been told to expect that that  will be completed by the end of November. Naturally, I hope that it will be  done much earlier, and I will urge the managers to do so.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The second part of Mr Molloy&rsquo;s question goes back to the  fundamental issue, which is why the Department revised the scheme. Heating  replacements will not be dealt with under this scheme. We want to ensure that  all houses, particularly those without central heating, can access such  heating. If the Member has a specific issue to address, he may like to pass it  to me for investigation.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  I commend the Minister and her Department for locating one of the warm homes  scheme provider&rsquo;s offices in Enniskillen, a town in the constituency and the  county that has by far the greatest level of unfitness. However, as we all  know, when all these schemes are done, we will still have people who face fuel  poverty. Does the Minister foresee anything more that can be done about that  poverty?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: More can be done. Mr Gallagher&rsquo;s question follows on  from that of Mr Armstrong. The Department also funds a substantial investment  in heating replacement schemes in the public housing stock.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Housing Executive has invested heavily in the energy  efficiency of its stock, including a substantial programme of conversion to  natural gas. I would like to see all public housing stock converted to cleaner,  more efficient natural gas where it is available, and I support the extension  of the gas network to more parts of Northern Ireland. I am conscious  that there will be an Adjournment debate on that issue this afternoon.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Fuel poverty is not about energy costs alone; it is also  about low incomes. Alongside the warm homes scheme and heating replacement  programmes, one of the Department for Social Development&rsquo;s key priorities is to  maximise household incomes through the benefit uptake campaign, which aims to  help people to claim their benefit entitlement. The current annual campaign,  about which Members were notified, started on 17 August 2009.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I informed Mr Armstrong in my answer to his question, my  Department also administers the winter fuel payment that everybody aged 60 or  over is entitled to receive. That will help elderly people to meet energy costs  during the winter months.</p>

    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="6"></a>Executive Committee Business</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Forestry Bill</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Second Stage</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Debate resumed on motion:</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That the Second Stage of the Forestry Bill [NIA 11/08] be  agreed. &mdash; <span class="Italic">[The Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development  (Ms Gildernew).]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I support the motion, but I also wish to raise some issues. In particular,  although I welcome many provisions in the Forestry Bill, I want the Minister to  take on board the fact that other aspects of it give me serious cause for  concern.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Forest Service recognises that the demand for forest  use is changing, but it is silent on all matters relating to shooting and, particularly,  deer stalking, despite significant reference having been made to the service&rsquo;s  desire to acquire additional powers for itself in that regard in its strategy  for sustainability and growth.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Aa the minnit the Forest Service dales wi&rsquo; the shuitin  community es yin o&rsquo; hits uiser curns bae gien oot permits fer gaime shuitin an&rsquo;  control o&rsquo; vermin, sae the fect at thair isnae onie mention o&rsquo; shuitin ir deer  stalkin&rsquo; i this consultation bes raire.

Oan  account o&rsquo; thon A wud ax the Meenester fer wie she hasnae yet tuk thon intae  account.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Forest Service currently engages with the shooting  community, as one of its user groups, through the issuance of permits for game  shooting and vermin control, so the absence of any mention of shooting or deer  stalking in the consultation that took place on the Bill is surprising. The  service has clearly not recognised the full extent, importance and validity of  recreational sporting shooting, the parallel role for recreational deer  stalkers in forest management and the substantial sporting tourism revenue that  is being lost.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Independent research by consultants at PACEC identified  that sporting shooting contributes more than &pound;45 million annually to the Northern Ireland  economy, sustaining some 2,100 full-time equivalent jobs. The shooting  community in Northern    Ireland also spends &pound;10 million a year on  conservation work and has management influence on 990,000 hectares around the  Province. Therefore, I ask the Minister why she has not yet taken that into  account.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Among the main concerns that exist is a proposal for Forest  Service staff, possibly including those non-staff to whom they delegate powers,  which is a worrying point, to be authorised to go on to all land that is  adjacent to forestry &mdash; not just the Forest Service&rsquo;s land alone but all  privately owned woodland &mdash; to shoot deer. The Forest Service has confirmed its  intention to double woodland and forestry in the Province from the current  level of 6% to 12%, as well as confirming that the increase will largely be  delivered by private owners. I welcome that fact, because it is good news, and,  in a small way, I am playing my part, because we have planted 2,500 trees, so  we are doing our wee bit to try to make that target achievable. However, the  problem is that the Forest Service wants powers to allow its rangers to go on  to private land that is adjacent to private forestry to shoot deer. Staff are  to be able to shoot deer day or night, 365 days a year, and they are to be  exempt from the provisions of the proposed new wildlife Order and the game  Acts.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to look at things through the end of a scope &mdash; not  through the end of a barrel &mdash; at a Forest Service that is trying to control  shooting rights on its land. I suggest that, if one can be both, it is probably  poacher and gamekeeper at the same time, and that concerns me.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When speaking to my colleague Lord Morrow beforehand, I was  reminded of a saying in a magazine that he and I both read, &lsquo;Shooting Times&rsquo;,  which states that the wildlife of today is not ours to dispose of as we please;  rather, we hold it in care for those who come after. Therefore, Mr Speaker, it  is important that the Forestry Bill ensure that wildlife be protected, as should  be landowners with land close to Forestry Service land.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Forestry Commission wants to be able to cull deer that  might cause damage, not just those that are actively causing damage, and to  recover the cost of such deer culling on private land &mdash; supposedly for the  benefit of other private woodland owners &mdash; from the owners of the adjacent  land. That is outrageous. Indeed, the commission wants the adjacent landowners  to pay for it as well.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Access to sporting shooting and deer stalking should be  given equal status with other sports and forest uses, and there should be  formalised engagement with the representative bodies for deer stalking and  shooting sports. The Chairperson of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural  Development, Mr Ian Paisley Jnr, commented earlier on recreational shooting and  tourism. There is potential to be realised.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In recommending the partnership solution, the British  Association for Shooting and Conservation (BASC) proposed that the Forest  Service join with the voluntary sector and other relevant bodies in a deer  forum. I suggest to the Minister that that is, perhaps, a way of addressing the  issue so that that opportunity can be extended, the voluntary sector can play a  role in further deer management, and the Forest Service can reduce its  overheads and direct commitments. That seems sensible, and I ask the Minister  to take it into account in her response.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Roger Pollen of the BASC informed me that the association  welcomes the principle of equality and access. If the process is to be  equality-proofed, which according to the legislation it is, we must have  equality for everyone. At present, we do not have equality for deer shooters  and country sports enthusiasts. It has to be genuine and inclusive.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The omission of shooting and deer stalking from the terms  of reference of the consultation causes widespread concern about the commitment  to genuine access and equality. To date, access for deer stalking has been  restricted to members of the Forest Service to the exclusion of the public,  even though the equivalent services in the rest of the UK allow  extensive public access for deer stalking. Thus, the current approach in Northern Ireland  is suppressing public value on at least three levels.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is limiting tourism potential. There are places in the  Province to which people come from across the water &mdash; from Germany, Denmark,  France and Belgium &mdash; to  shoot deer. Why do we not use that potential to create tourism and put the  money back into the borough? The current approach is denying equality of access  to the shooting community; it is failing to reduce public-sector costs; and it  is failing to gain income from the public purse. The potential exists; let us  realise it. The consultation recognises increasing afforestation, with  associated challenges and opportunities, yet makes no reference to necessary  deer management or to sharing the forest with the shooting community.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To answer the question, I do not believe that charging is a  significant barrier to participation; in fact, charging for deer stalking could  produce significant revenues. Money could be put back into the economy, the  Forestry Commission and the system. Access to the forest for shooting is  already closely regulated. Therefore, extending access to deer stalking should  present no significant challenges but should be undertaken to ensure fair  opportunity.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are recreational and social benefits to be derived  from engaging with the shooting community. Those benefits, when applied to deer  stalking, must not be underestimated. Thus, in asking whether the main  opportunities have been identified &mdash; a question that the Minister and the  Forestry Commission asked through the Forestry Bill &mdash; it is clear that a huge  opportunity has not been identified: deer stalking. It has been entirely  overlooked as a local demand and a tourism resource. It is a sure money earner.  I am sure that the Minister will not pass on exploiting that potential.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Scotland,  for example, and other parts of the UK have embraced those  opportunities with the establish&shy;ment of publicly funded posts to promote  country sports tourism. The data revealed in the PACEC report show the current  value of shooting to the Northern    Ireland economy, but there is further  potential to be realised, and the Forest Service has a role to play in its  development. When considering that sporting shooting provides an excellent  off-season tourism opportunity, it is clear that there is scope for promoting  it as a separate marketing strand. Partnership with the main representative  bodies, noted in my introduction, could ensure effective marketing of that  opportunity. Do it right and take full value of what is there.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have, as have, perhaps, the Minister and other Members,  been contacted by landowners of adjacent properties who are concerned that  clause 30(4) gives a blanket public right to access on foot to all forestry  land for the purpose of recreation. As the definition of forestry land is land  that is owned by the Department, that does not mean land that is privately  owned. However, there is concern that there will be cases of &ldquo;right to roam&rdquo;,  as has happened in Scotland  and other parts of the UK.  If any forestry or Department land has shooting rights attached to it that  belong to someone else, there is a possibility that those rights will be  interfered with. It is important that we have protection for the landowners of  adjacent land and that we have a system that does not encroach upon that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is also concern that clause 31, which allows a power  of entry to any land and which seems to be in reference to the felling of  trees, will give rise to the need for private landowners to have a felling  licence for felling their trees. Such a licence will only be issued with a  management plan, and that puts the landowners under more unwarranted strain.  The decision to fell trees that are not protected is a decision for the owner,  not the forestry division. Moreover, clause 14 issues a blanket ban, which, I  believe, cannot and should not be enforced on private landowners and which  could be construed as the Department having control of private woodlands and,  subsequently, as a nationalisation proposal. Therefore there is a question mark  over where this is going. It is feared that this is the compulsory acquisition  of land, and that leaves the Department in complete control at a time when it  is underfunded and, in some cases, ill-equipped to be so, regardless of whether  it is fair to landowners. Where is the fairness for the landowners in that  process? They are the people for whom I am fighting the bit today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Those are the concerns that the Minister must address  directly in order to assure us that that is not the purpose of those clauses of  the Bill, as it would be grossly unfair if those concerns were found to be  justified. The Minister will respond to us on that. I ask the Minister to put  those concerns to rest and to qualify and quantify the issues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the concept of better access to the public  forest, as will many in the Chamber, but the Bill must also represent genuine  equality of opportunity. The shooting community should not and must not be  ignored and omitted from this process any longer, and neither can the private  landowners have their manage&shy;ment rights to their own land taken from them.  That has to be addressed as well.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill will come back to the Committee, and the Committee  members will have a chance to look at those issues, but I ask the Minister to  take my comments on board. They are serious, genuine and honest comments. I  represent a large number of people in the Province, as do many Members, who  will be affected disproportionately by the legislation if it goes the wrong  way.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  I congratulate the Minister and her Department for the work that has been done  on the Bill, and I thank the Department for meeting us in the summer. I also  thank the consultees who responded. A great deal of useful information was  provided, much of which Members will have heard before.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Since I am not a member of the Committee for Agriculture  and Rural Development, Members might be wondering why I am speaking in this  debate, but many people rang me this summer and asked me to get involved. As my  colleague Tom Elliott has done, I must declare an interest; I am the owner of  some five acres of woodland that are as old as I am &mdash; about 50 years young.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is an imbalance in the objectives of the Bill. There  is too much power placed in the Department&rsquo;s hands with not enough checks and  balances, and there are many areas that need clarification. We need the stakeholder  advisory committee, which many Members have mentioned. I am not going to go  into every matter, despite the ream of paper that I have in front of me. There  is an imbalance in the Bill&rsquo;s objectives. It promotes forestry and develops  forestation, primarily in line with its wish to supply trees and timber.  However, we need to improve the balance; it needs to protect the environment  and encourage the enjoyment of the forests. It should balance the supplying of  trees and timbers with economic, social, environmental and recreational uses.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Forestry is a long-term business. I agree with the need to  double the amount of land that we have in forestry from 6% to 12%, but we need  to be careful about how we do it. The Bill is definitely a step in the right  direction.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the long term, we do not know what is in store for us.  Global warming, whether our fault or not, a population explosion, and the loss  of good farmland worldwide mean that we may have to grow more, but we must also  educate more, and the use of woodland is essential in that. At the same time,  we must respect private landowners and their pastimes. We need an independent  forestry body that has teeth and that will be listened to rather than just be  consulted.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On the matter of too much power: reading the text shows  that the Department wants to acquire land by agreement; erect such buildings  and execute such other works on forestry land as it considers necessary;  provide facilities on the land that it considers desirable, and compulsorily  acquire any land it requires in order to perform any function under the Bill.  The Department also wants to act in its role as the occupier of the land and be  able to kill, cull or destroy any wild animals on that land, or on adjoining  land; impose reasonable fees or other charges as it may prescribe; make by-laws  for the preservation of trees or timber on forestry land and prohibit or  regulate any act that may injure or deform forestry land. If one adds powers of  entry to the land; the need for permission to fell trees, and the power to set  fees, one will realise that the Department is seeking extremely strong powers,  which I do not think it requires.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I know that the Bill is a wish list, or probably more of an  intend-to-have list. I also know that the Department would not use all of those  powers unless it had to do so. However, we must take great care. If one takes  all of the powers contained in the Bill together, the Depart&shy;ment could flatten  a forest or woodland and build a housing estate; it could buy anyone out, and  it could control the market and the value of the land. The Department could  also kill any animals and pests when it feels it needs to do so; and, as I have  said before, it could set fees and charges, whether farmers or others could  afford them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I know that the Department will only use the powers in the  Bill in exceptional cases. However, the Assembly must ensure that the proper  checks and balances are in the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Many points require more clarification and a bit more  thought, such as the Department being subject to planning law at all times.  Charges and fees must be discussed in detail and, like planning fees, must be  passed by the Assembly, if they are required at all. Moreover, the Department,  or Forest Service, owns 80% or more of the trees, so why make the small,  possible powerless, private sector pay? There will be little in return, and it  is not fair to ask that sector to pay if the Forest Service does not.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Who will decide whether animals are doing enough damage to  merit a cull, and who will ensure that breeding cycles, animal welfare and  every other factor is considered? Who will decide when the Department can go  onto someone else&rsquo;s land to cull or clear threatening crops?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Rights of appeal are set out in the Bill, but the time  frame for appeals also concerns me. We must have a really dynamic and fast  appeals system. The present system in the Department is incredibly slow, as are  other matters, and improvement will require much more resources. We are meant  to be considering cut backs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As regards some specific items in the Bill: the Department  wants felling licences to be applied for, which will give total control for  trees in woodlands over 0&middot;2 hectares, trees over 10 centimetres thick, and in areas  where there is five cubic metres of timber. That is good thinking, but it is  also very dangerous. Why does the provision not include all trees in all areas?  That would stop developers felling trees at weekends. Indeed, perhaps we should  examine a retrospective law on that point so that they do not start doing it  tomorrow.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want all trees between 100 and 150 years old to be  protected. On two or three occasions today, the term &ldquo;ancient woodland&rdquo; has  been mentioned, but I wonder how many Members know that that means trees that  are pre-1600, which accounts for very few of the trees in Northern Ireland. We  should increase that to 100 or 150 years old.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The proposed licensing is in line with mainland legislation  and seems sensible. However, it should be in the form of a licence that is  linked to a plan of over five years, in which the private forestry farmer is  free to fell within his licence whenever timber is needed by the market. The  Forest Service must also be required to get a licence. If trees are being planted  and managed according to the UK Woodlands Assurance Standard, which is  sustainable, they should be exempt; perhaps other areas should also be exempt.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to access, clause 30 states:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the public shall have right of access on foot to all  forestry land for the purposes of recreation.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">It has already been clarified that that means  forestry land only, and I am grateful for that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members of country sports clubs and other users also have major  concerns about the Bill. In Tardree forest, which is in my locality, we have  game shooting, horse riding, quad bikes, cross-country bicycling, ramblers and  one or two more unsavoury uses. We need the balance of a central body, probably  a voluntary body, to manage that. We need to respect the rights of all and  consult and work with all users. We need an independent advisory body.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is conflict among the people who use the Belfast hills, where  opening up the land means that farmers have problems with insurance. There has  been damage to fences, cattle have been let out &mdash; or let in &mdash; and many other  things.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill seeks the power to cull pests, and that seems  reasonable. However, who knows best? We need an advisory panel for checks and  balances.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When trees are being felled, it is a dangerous situation.  When the trees are young, there is the risk of fire; when the trees are being  felled, there is even more danger. Advice will be needed when the by-laws are  being drawn up.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  Does the Member agree that a forum could be used as one method for reaching  agreement? I suggested a deer forum, but there could be a forum that would  include all the other bodies.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  I agree entirely; whether it is one forum or a group of different bodies,  advice is always needed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to sporting bodies, shooting rights exist on  private and departmental land. The BASC states that the value of sports to our  economy is worth &pound;45 million, and some 2,100 full-time jobs rely on it; Members  have already heard those figures. That is evident at game fairs and country  shows throughout Northern    Ireland. Those rights should not be  compulsory on the Department, but they will need to be discussed with the  groups.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The power to cull all animals includes the wish to enter forestry  land and adjoining land to cull animals. That is against the present gun and  wildlife laws. That should be done only through an independent body, by  agreement and within the law.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To conclude &mdash; Members will be pleased as I have been going  on for too long &mdash; there is the possibility of too much power without enough  checks and balances. We need an advisory body that will include wildlife groups,  biodiversity groups, timber groups, countryside groups, sports groups and many  others. There are many points that I have not addressed, but I welcome the need  for an inventory. We do not want compulsory purchase, other than for access.  The Committee has much to do, and UUP Members look forward to being able to  help it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  Like other Members, I support the proposed legislation. However, it must be  strengthened in a number of ways.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The importance of woods and trees to our environ&shy;ment has  never been more apparent than it is today. They are essential for climate  regulation; for the flow and quality of water; for mitigation of air pollution;  for soil conservation; for storing carbon; and for our society to adapt to  climate change. They also encourage exercise, improve physical health and  reduce mental stress.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As other Members have pointed out, Northern Ireland has fewer trees and less  woodland than almost any other country in Europe.  Woodland accounts for a mere 6% of our land, compared with the European average  of 44%. Even the UK  and the Republic are better, with 12% and 10% woodland cover respectively.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is even worse if we consider ancient woodland. Of the 6%  woodland cover, only 0&middot;08% is ancient woodland. Indeed, since felling licences  were abolished in the 1960s, 273 of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s ancient woods  have been lost to felling. We have failed to protect our woodlands and are now  paying the price.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Those statistics give cause for alarm, because ancient  woods are our equivalent of the rainforest. They are rich in wildlife, and one  of the foundations upon which we can restore our natural environment. The Bill,  although belated, is welcome. However, as it stands, it does not give adequate  protection to ancient woods. The general duty of the Department should be  amended to ensure that both DARD and its agencies are able to deliver on all  the benefits accruing from native woodland and the biodiversity that it  supports. Protecting native and ancient woods should be part of the  Department&rsquo;s general duty.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The clause must include a clear definition of  sustainability, a term generally understood as referring to development that  meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future  generations to meet their own needs. By ensconcing sustainable forestry at the  heart of the Bill, the Minister can ensure that forestry practice encompasses  environmental and social issues as well as continuing to recognise the need for  commercial harvesting.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the Bill&rsquo;s current form, the definition of forestry land  is limited to:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;any land held by the Department for the purposes of  any of its functions under this Act&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is incompatible with the challenges on the  ground, because some of the most beautiful ancient and native woods are not  owned by the Forest Service. DARD and the Forest Service should therefore have  a responsibility to advise and assist landowners in the public, private and  charitable sectors on how best to manage their woods, should that help be  required. The Bill should be strengthened to take that into account.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In light of the loss of ancient and native woods, I welcome  the fact that the Bill proposes to reintroduce the requirement for felling  licences. In fact, I have raised the need for tree-felling licences in the  Assembly on a number of occasions. They are required in the UK, and throughout most of Europe, but were  abolished in Northern    Ireland in the late 1960s. I have no doubt  that the abolition of felling licences played a major part in the destruction  of our woodlands over the past 50 years.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is also disappointing that the new felling regime  outlined in part 3 of the Bill fails to explicitly mention ancient woods. A  number of other Members have referred to that. In practice, that means that  ancient woods will not be afforded any additional protection, and they are  still under threat from clear felling. I support Dr Farry and Dr McCrea in  asking the Minister to insert a new clause in the Bill that offers a  presumption against granting a felling licence in respect of all woods  identified on the ancient woodland inventory. That inventory was completed by  the Woodland Trust in 2006, and is based on sound research and field survey. It  identifies all recognised areas of ancient woodland in Northern Ireland,  and is used by the Planning Service as a material consideration in all planning  applications.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I previously mentioned, ancient woodland covers only  0&middot;08% of our landscape, and its protection would not place an onerous duty on  either Departments or landowners. Indeed, by including such a new clause in the  Bill, the Minister would be able to reassure the Assembly that ancient woods  will be appropriately protected, both now and for future generations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am also concerned about clause 16 of the Bill, which  authorises DARD to pay compensation to an applicant should they be refused a  felling licence. In my view, there is absolutely no justification for that  compensation, as public money should not be paid for simply obeying the law. If  public money is used in that way, it would have a detrimental effect on other  Executive commitments, such as the doubling of woodland cover and adapting to  climate change. In fact, if the clause were introduced, it might actually deter  DARD or the Forest Service from refusing a felling licence, even if there are  valid environmental grounds for doing so. I ask the Minister to remove that  clause from the Bill.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am also concerned that the land owned by Govern&shy;ment  Departments is exempt from felling licences. As that land accounts for 70% of  the total forest area, it is necessary to reconsider that provision.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the coming weeks, the Assembly will have an invaluable  opportunity to shape forestry legislation to ensure that it provides a  framework for meeting the challenges of the twenty-first century. With that in  mind, the Bill needs to be strengthened to offer greater protection to ancient  woods. That is achievable by amending both the general duty on the Department  and the proposed felling licence regime and by removing the clause providing  compensation to developers refused felling licences. I support the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development (Ms Gildernew)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a  Cheann Comhairle. Second Stage Forestry Bill: part three. I appreciate the  indulgence of the Speaker and Members; I know that this debate has been a wee  bit disjointed. I also appreciate the nature of the debate, in which all involved  have been very good humoured. There is cognisance of the fact that the  Assembly&rsquo;s primary purpose is to legislate, and it is a good sign that this  legislation has had its Second Stage on the second day of the new session. I  hope for similar indulgence from the Assembly on other legislation that I plan  to bring forward over the coming months.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As many Members have pointed out, the current forestry  legislation is 56 years old. From that point of view, although Members have  challenged my Department on the vagueness of parts of the Bill or have said  that there are not enough specifics in it, our hope is that this Bill is  written in such a way that it is fit for purpose and lasts into the future. I  hope that it will not be another half century before new forestry legislation  is passed, but certainly the legislation needs to be vague enough to cover  issues that we do not foresee today but that may be important in five, 10, or  15 years. Therefore, the detail on a lot of the issues involved will come in  subordinate legislation, and the Committee and stakeholders will have ample  opportunity to contribute to that subordinate legislation and to help us to get  it right.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will now go through Members&rsquo; contributions. I apologise  in advance if I do not cover everything, but I will refer to the Hansard report  and follow up on any questions that have been put to me and that I have been  unable to answer.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The first contribution was from the Chairperson of the  Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development, Ian Paisley Jnr. He challenged  us on the recreation aspects of the Bill and argued that what we do needs to  become more widely encompassing. I agree with him fully; I have made recreation  and getting people into forests a ministerial priority, and my Department has  recently published a strategy to bring that about. Through this Bill, I am  determined to have a more balanced arrangement between timber production and  the use of our forests for recreation and leisure. In establishing that, I have  responded to the views of stakeholders and reflected my own view that we must  increase our recreational provision. However, I am very happy to work with the  Committee to ensure that we get it right and that there is a proper regional  balance in leisure provision.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some of the recreation and leisure facilities that we  already provide include woodland walks, cycling and recreational shooting.  Earlier this year, I announced that the Forest Service had appointed an  operator to deliver high-trees adventure facilities in Tollymore Forest Park,  and hopefully that will open next Easter. A lot is being done, but I agree: we  need to do an awful lot more, and we will want to do that in the time ahead.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Willie Clarke alluded strongly to the tourism aspect and to  getting the balance right. He talked about log cabins and the recreational use  of forests and made a local plug for south Down. We see a lot of potential in  south Down, but in areas such as the Sperrins there is also potential to  develop recreational pursuits in Forest Service areas. Willie also talked about  native woodland, which was certainly a theme throughout this after&shy;noon&rsquo;s  debate. A lot of people were concerned about the need to protect our native and  ancient woodlands.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Tom Elliott described a modest area of forestry; I would  love to know what he means by &ldquo;modest&rdquo;. He asked for a clarification of what  constitutes ancient woodland. &ldquo;Ancient&rdquo;, as I believe Brian pointed out, means  that a woodland dates from the 1600s onwards, and &ldquo;long-established&rdquo; means that  it dates from the 1830s onwards. Members are right: we absolutely do not have  enough of our ancient and long-established woodlands protected. They are a  valuable resource, and I do not mean from the point of view of cutting them  down. The uniqueness of the flora and fauna in those long-established and  native woodlands is something that we are all very proud of.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Tom also asked whether short-rotation coppice could be  categorised as trees. Short-rotation coppice refers primarily to willow, but  there are other woodland short-rotation systems. A native tree that might be  used in short rotation is ash, and eucalyptus can also be used. Therefore,  short rotation applies to not just willow. Willow is from the same family as sally and,  obviously, is a tree. There is now a use for willow, as Mr Elliott will know,  because companies such as Balcas are turning it into woodchip and pellets and  providing alternative and renewable energy sources.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have to be pragmatic and ensure that we are increasing  our forestry cover, and we will not do that with just broadleaf or native  species. There must be a mix to ensure that we get the coverage that we are  aspiring to. Members said that that is not achievable, and it might not be.  However, I will give it my best shot and do everything that I can to double the  rate of our forestry cover because, as many Members pointed out, 6% coverage is  not good enough. It will be a difficult target to achieve, but I will do  everything that is in my power to do that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Tom Elliott also spoke about the disposal of forestry land.  I can see why that question came up, but, under the 1953 Act, the Department  has the power to sell any land that has been acquired for forestry, and it does  so from time to time when the land is not required. However, any disposal of  land will be considered carefully and in the context of our strategic aim to  double forest cover. Therefore, there might be times when we want to dispose of  some land in order to buy more to give us, for example, more scope, but there  are reasons for that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Again, like many other Members, Mr Elliott, the Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development, talked  about the wide range of powers that the Department is seeking to introduce  through the Bill. Compulsory purchase powers will be used sparingly under  existing, well-established government compulsory purchase arrangements. They  are intended, principally, to enable access to land-locked timber resources  that have been created at public expense. There might be other circumstances in  which land might be required; for example, to enable access for recreation or  tourism initiatives. That is why that provision has been widely drafted.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the current economic climate, which I do not foresee  changing radically over the next period, we do not have the money to buy land  to put into forestry. I would love it if we had, but we do not. Therefore, I  see compulsory purchase powers being used very little. In fact, the Bill will  be going before the Committee for scrutiny. It is more a case of, perhaps,  buying a corner of a field or something in order to get access to timber that  is mature and that has a value to the public purse. Believe me, however, this  is not about buying up swathes of land and putting it into forestry production;  the resources for that are simply not there.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Elliott also spoke about clause 7, which deals with  incidental powers. That issue came up in the debate time and time again, and Dr  McCrea also made significant mention of it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That clause allows engagement in partnerships or  participation in a body corporate for the general functions that are carried  out by the Forest Service, which could relate to future recreational or  renewable energy initiatives. The Forestry Commission in England and Wales has such powers under the  Forestry Act 1967. The power is intended not to be additional to the general  duty but to supplement it. I am loath to give swingeing powers to anyone  without checks and balances. We want those powers to be used responsibly, and  that will be dealt with in Committee. We want the Committee to have its role in  scrutinising the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Elliott also raised the need for the Department to have  felling licences. I assure Members that the Department is bound by fairly  stringent standards such as the UK Woodland Assurance Standard and the Forest  Stewardship Council. The Forest Service is audited annually on the standards  that we have to comply with. We are more than happy to be part of that and for  robust standards to be in place. We have a duty to enhance tree cover; it is  not in the Department&rsquo;s interest to chop down trees. Where there is a  commercial aspect, we will reinvigorate it, and where trees are harvested, they  will be replanted.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Fairly stringent standards already apply to the Department,  and if it were to be regulated through felling licences, as some Members have  suggested, it would lead to duplication and unnecessary bureaucracy. The  Department would have to apply to the Department, and we all require  Departments to make best use of their resources and not carry out unnecessary  work. That work certainly would be unnecessary, given the standards that  already apply to the Forest Service in its duty of care. If necessary, Mr  Elliott can come back to me on any of those issues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Stephen Farry had much to say on the need for increased  cover. I fully acknowledge that our cover is not good enough, and I am  committed to forest expansion. That is one of the Forest Service&rsquo;s key policy  objectives, but, as a policy issue, it does not require a statutory position.  Mr Farry also talked about climate change contribution, and he acknowledged the  importance of the role that forestry can play. I fully concur with that. Our  contribution to that will be within the context of the forestry standard and  associated climate guidance. I noted Mr Farry&rsquo;s comments on clauses 4, 6 and 7  and on other points. I am happy to reflect on those and take his views forward  on the matter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Dr McCrea talked about the use of forest land for tourism  purposes and about planning permission and integration into planning  strategies. That will certainly be done, and the Department would be subject to  the same planning permission considerations and scrutiny as any other body or  agency. We will need planning permission if we are to create tourism projects,  and those would also be subject to environmental impact assessments. Checks and  balances will be in place.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Dr McCrea also talked about the need for the Department to  have felling licences and about its proposed powers of entry, which is always a  controversial power. The Department will want to take the time to discuss those  issues carefully with the Committee to give it a role in helping us to make the  Bill a piece of legislation of which we can be proud. He also pointed out issues  about recreation, and I emphasise that other Departments have a role in that,  whether it is the DOE, which has a role with environmental aspects, or DCAL,  which has a role with recreational aspects. However, we will also look to other  partners, such as local councils. We have already heard good examples of how we  work together to improve the recreation product of forestry land.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Dr McCrea also talked about controlling wildlife in state  forests. We have established that that needs to be done. He also talked about  the time that it takes to process licences. I agree that we want to do that  with as little bureaucracy as possible. We want it to be a simple procedure  that does not take long, because it is to no one&rsquo;s benefit if it does. We also  want to work with landowners to ensure that those licences result in woodland  sustainability. We want them to be straightforward. The detail will come  through in subordinate legislation. I want to emphasise the Committee&rsquo;s role in  that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Pat Doherty mentioned that the Forestry Act 1953 is 56  years old and that, therefore, it is younger than him. I am not sure about  that; Pat is looking youthful these days. He talked about rural roads.  Certainly, in my constituency, we share those concerns about the ability to put  roads back to their original condition. I agree with him wholeheartedly: it is  a huge difficulty for local communities. We will want to address that during  the coming weeks and months.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Tourism was a theme of William Irwin&rsquo;s remarks. He said  that more could be done. He covered clause 5 and was one of the people who said  that he did not believe that large-scale forestation is achievable.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although I do not want to rush through my comments, I do  not want to repeat what Members have already said and to go through clauses  that have already been talked about. Mr Savage said that the Department is  looking for too much power and that there are no meaningful checks and  balances. Again, he is on the Committee, so I will be able to sit down with him  and others to work through those issues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Dolores Kelly described the Bill as a vision for the next  50 years. No pressure then, Dolores. John Dallat made an intervention about  tree-hugging. I am not sure whether he was talking about him or me. The words  &ldquo;mighty oaks&rdquo; and &ldquo;little acorns&rdquo; sprang to mind. Dolores went on to talk about  addressing the ill effects of the Plantation.  Certainly, we would all love to be in a position to do something about that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Dolores raised a point about the stakeholder advisory  committee, which was a theme throughout the debate. She also mentioned the  woodland survey and inventory. We do very much take stock of what is already  recorded on the inventory because we accept the importance of native woodlands  and want to ensure that it takes cognisance of what we have in order for it to  be protected.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I think that Dolores also mentioned the amount of tree  cover. Six per cent tree cover equates to 80,000 hectares. The Department&rsquo;s  plan is to double it, which is an extremely ambitious target.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Jim Shannon talked about shooting deer &mdash; he has never seen  &lsquo;Bambi&rsquo;, then &mdash; and about giving the voluntary sector a role in controlling  deer and the equality element of that. Obviously, the Department has looked at  the issue. It would be remiss of me to bring forward a Bill that did not  encompass everyone&rsquo;s equality. I take his point about country sports and  tourism.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The &ldquo;right to roam&rdquo; applies only to Forest Service land. I  know that that issue gave people some cause for concern. It is about giving all  of us pedestrian access to Forest Service land and forests so that we can  better enjoy and appreciate what we have.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I believe that it was Danny Kinahan&rsquo;s first involvement in  a debate with me. He mentioned his five acres of land. We all get precious  about the few trees that we have. Would it not be lovely if we all had more?  Fair play to him. He talked about a better balance between timber production  and social, environmental and recreational needs. He also talked about climate  change and the powers that the Department has introduced in the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I was taken aback by Mr Kinahan&rsquo;s comment that the  Department could flatten a forest to build a housing estate. We could not and  would not do that; that is not what we are here to do. As set out in clause 1  of the Bill, our primary focus is to protect forestry and ensure that we  continue to roll out forestry cover. The suggestion that the Department would  do otherwise flies in the face of clause 1. That is not what we are here to do.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Kinahan also said that we need a dynamic appeals system.  That is certainly something that I am trying to get through all aspects of the  Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. He spoke about the need to  have trees in all areas and about developers felling trees at weekends. We all  know of such issues in our constituencies. However, tree preservation orders  are still the remit of the Department of the Environment. I want to be careful  not to overstep the mark and tread on the work of other Departments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Brian Wilson spoke about the benefits of trees, forests and  our ancient woodlands. He, too, pointed out that the abolishment of felling  licences in the 1960s had a detrimental impact. It is, therefore, important  that the requirement for a felling licence be included in the Bill to ensure  that we protect our native woodlands. Mr Wilson also raised environmental and  social issues and said that we should look at the issue of a presumption  against a felling licence, which was a point that was raised earlier.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are at only the Second Stage of the Bill, and we have a  long way to go. We will appreciate the co-operation of the Agriculture and  Rural Development Committee in working to create legislation of which we can  all be proud and which, hopefully, will last well into the future &mdash; although  not another half-century.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We must ensure that we double our forestry cover and that  we protect wildlife, both flora and fauna, and the environment in forests. We  must also ensure that we have more habitats for animals and flowers in forests  and that there is more scope for them to flourish. We have a big job to do. It  is great that so many Members contributed to the debate today and that so much  goodwill has been shown towards the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>

    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="7"></a>Private Members&rsquo; Business</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Home Improvement Grants</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30 minutes for  the debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes to propose and 10  minutes to make a winding-up speech. All other Members who wish to speak will  have five minutes. One amendment has been selected and published on the  Marshalled List. The proposer of the amendment will have 10 minutes to propose  and five minutes for the winding-up speech.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That this Assembly urges the Minister for Social  Development to explain why the Housing Executive has suspended the payment of  home improvement grants, despite the Department for Social Development being  awarded an extra &pound;20m in the June monitoring round for housing; and further  calls on the Minister to remove the suspension of these grants, which are vital  to meeting the Decent Homes Standards to enable essential maintenance and home  improvements work to be carried out.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I am sure that  there will be widespread support in the Chamber for this motion as the issue  under discussion affects people in all constituencies. How many Members have  had people call to their offices and homes about home improvement grants? How  many times have we received phone calls from people, young and old, who are in  despair after learning that the Housing Executive has turned down their  application for help towards home improvements?</p>
    <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Dallat] in the Chair)</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As if that were not bad enough, how many of those people  were encouraged to make an application only to be told by the Housing Executive  at the last hurdle &mdash; after having gone through the entire process &mdash; that,  because of budgetary problems, their grants would be frozen and that they would  have to continue to live in the terrible conditions that they were trying to  improve by applying for grant assistance?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister said that she would rather put a roof over  people&rsquo;s heads than worry about kitchen replace&shy;ments. What about the people  who are sitting in homes with leaking roofs? What about the people whose  electricity supply is substandard and in a dangerous condition? What about the  people whose homes are riddled with damp and crumbling because of that?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">What about people who live in a rural setting, have to  endure intolerable living conditions and are waiting for help, only to be told  that the Minister has redirected the money? She would rather put a roof on a  new house than tackle the atrocious conditions that exist in many of the houses  that have been refused assistance.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Perhaps the Minister can tell us how many of the houses  that had a grant application refused were checked to ensure that they met  health and safety standards. Are there ramifications for the health of the  families who live in those houses? Two such families attended one of her  infamous roadshows in Newry to ask that question, but they were shouted down  and heckled by SDLP members. Where is the concern for those families?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister needs to explain why she does not spread her  budget more evenly to ensure that houses that are in a bad state of repair can  be assisted along with the newbuilds. She needs to explain why rotten kitchens  and heating systems that affect people&rsquo;s health will not be replaced. Does she  not realise that she is storing up a financial nightmare for the future? Does  she not realise that rotten and decaying kitchens and doors affect the fabric  of a house and cost more to put right further down the road? Does she not also  realise that a heating system that is not repaired or replaced affects the  fabric of a house?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Will the Member put on record his recognition that the housing budget has a  shortfall of more than &pound;100 million?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  I have no difficulty agreeing that there is a shortfall in the housing budget.  However, the problem with the budget has been that the Minister has redirected  all the finances towards newbuilds, which created the mess that we are in  today. Over the past number of monitoring rounds, considerable amounts of money  have been given to the Minister to deal with some of the problems that I  mentioned, but she has chosen not to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">What costs can be matched against the damage to a person&rsquo;s  health? Those are questions that the Minister needs to answer. She should not  blame other people, which she usually does. She should not evade the hard  questions or play with words, which she has become famous for. Too much depends  on this. Thousands of people are waiting for answers to those questions;  hundreds of people who are employed in the sector, including Egan contractors,  depend on the work to put bread on the table for their families.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that all Members have received letters from small  contractors who are involved in the renovation sector saying that they are  among the 900 small contractors who rely totally on the business from the home  improvement grants to survive. That sector will go to the wall because of  decisions taken by the Minister.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister should admit that her interference led us to  this crisis; she should admit that she made a mistake. How much of the money  that should have been used to fund an improvement programme or those working on  the Egan contracts has been used to purchase properties from private  developers?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister know how much money people have spent on  preparing documents to supply the Housing Executive with plans for the work  that they intended to carry out? How can that money be recouped? It is my  understanding that some 14,700 people applied for grants, and the Housing  Executive had a statutory responsibility to complete the work in 4,000 of those  cases. In 9,700 instances, applications for a grant were refused or suspended.  How do those people recoup the money that they spent in preparation for the  receipt of a grant? They include elderly people who cannot afford to lose that  money and families who had to borrow money to fulfil the requirements that were  laid out by the Housing Executive. Will the Minister tell the House if she will  guarantee that those people will receive refunds? Many people only took part in  the scheme on the back of advice that they received from the Housing Executive,  only to be told at the last minute that their grant had been frozen: where is  the fairness in that? There are many questions for the Minister to answer and,  as elected representatives, we require those answers to ensure that our  constituents are given the correct information. We await the Minister&rsquo;s  explanation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Even this morning, Members from across the House approached  me to tell me horror stories from people in Derry, Strabane, Newry, Armagh,  Fermanagh and across the board. Many people in rural areas live in atrocious  conditions. The Minister said earlier that any case put forward would be  investigated, but we continually put cases forward, and they are continually  knocked back. That is the problem, and the Minister needs to deal with it right  away.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burns</strong>: I  beg to move the following amendment: Leave out &lsquo;remove&rsquo; and insert: &ldquo;review&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am delighted to make my first speech of the new Assembly  term on such an important topic. Last year, the House saw many Sinn F&eacute;in  motions that were directed at the Minister for Social Development. The SDLP did  not support those motions, and it will not support this one without the  acceptance of the amendment that I have proposed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We all recognise the importance of the private-sector  housing grants scheme, as detailed in the motion. I am a strong supporter of  that scheme, which is an important tool for tackling bad conditions in  private-sector housing. Those grants help people on low incomes who own their  own homes to get their houses up to the decent homes standard. There is a real  need for those grants, of that there is no doubt, and we can all agree on that  aspect of the motion. People who need grants come into my constituency office,  and they are desperately disappointed that those grants have been deferred or  suspended. People need those grants to help to bring their houses up to a  better standard.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At the same time, however, we all know that the Minister is  caught in a catch-22 situation. She did indeed receive &pound;20 million in the June  monitoring round, but that money had conditions attached: DSD had the money  spent before it was received. The Minister will no doubt explain in detail that  that money needed to be spent on Egan contractors, kitchen replacements and  bathroom replacements. Even with that extra &pound;20 million, the budget for the  Department for Social Development is still far short of what is required.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  I think that most Members have been lobbied by people who work under Egan  contracts. They say that the work that they are in the process of carrying out  will shortly dry up and that they will be back to square one. As far as Egan  contractors are concerned, &pound;5 million of that &pound;20 million was set aside to deal  with their contracts. What happened to the rest of that money?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burns</strong>: As  you very well know, the Egan contractors who lobbied everyone had been given a  commitment about all the work that needed to be completed for public-sector  housing. Everyone knows that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Originally, DSD needed an extra &pound;100 million; that figure  is now a mere &pound;80 million. The reasons for the budget shortfall are well known,  so I will not repeat them; the SDLP has been repeating those reasons for a long  time. However, I remind Members of the reduction in income caused by the global  economic downturn. I am happy that the Finance Minister is listening; Mr Wilson  clearly understands the SDLP&rsquo;s arguments. We will continue to press him for  more money, and perhaps the social-housing budget will once again be put on a  firm footing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is because of the lack of money that grants have been  suspended. No doubt, all parties in the Assembly care about the people who need  those grants. However, we cannot spend money that we do not have. That is why  our proposed amendment calls for the Minister to keep the suspension under  review. To open up a grants free-for-all when we do not have the money would  not be wise.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members must understand that within the funding shortfall,  DSD has to consider carefully how every penny is spent, and providing new homes  is the main priority. All Members will have people who are on housing waiting  lists coming to their constituency offices.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Thousands of new homes are required as a matter of urgency,  and current market conditions are well suited to building new houses. For that  reason, the SDLP is committed to new building targets. The money for that is  protected, and we will meet those targets.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The budget for the warm homes scheme is also protected to  help householders who live in fuel poverty, as is the money for the Supporting  People programme. The Minister has said many times that she will protect the  most vulnerable in our society, and she deserves credit for that. Beyond that,  given the budget shortfall, savings will have to be made somewhere. The  Minister of Finance and Personnel knows that the money cannot be raised through  the sale of land or houses, and, therefore, he must come up with additional  funding. If he does that, the Minister for Social Development will be able to  review the suspension, as proposed in our amendment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Let me make it perfectly clear that there is no lack of  will to provide the grants; the problem is a lack of money. I am hopeful that  the suspension will be temporary, and I urge the Minister of Finance and  Personnel to double his efforts to find the money to balance the DSD budget  once and for all.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Social Development (Mr Hamilton)</strong>: I will speak  initially in my role as Chairman of the Committee for Social Development. The  Committee considered the Depart&shy;ment&rsquo;s June monitoring round submission prior  to the summer recess and endorsed the Department&rsquo;s bids. However, members felt  that, given the budgetary challenges facing the Executive at that time &mdash; indeed  at all times &mdash; all bids, which amounted to &pound;130 million, were unlikely to be  met in the June monitoring round.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Deputy Chairperson, Mr Hilditch, spoke in the House in  July and warmly welcomed the outcome of the monitoring round, which included,  as has been mentioned, an additional &pound;20 million for renovation grants and for  disabled adaptations. Most Members will be aware of some people&rsquo;s frustration  about renovation grants. Those householders want to improve their homes. They  have made grant applications and, perhaps, incurred costs in doing so. They  lodged those applications with the Housing Executive and had hoped that the  extra money announced in June would lead to payment of their grants. It is now  my under&shy;standing, as has been mentioned, that the backlog of applications was  such that the additional money announced in June would only cover the cost of  statutorily and contractually committed renovation work that was already in the  system.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee recognises the budgetary pressures and the  difficult choices facing the Minister. However, the Committee expects important  statutory housing obligations &mdash; for example, in relation to the special  purchase of evacuated dwellings scheme (SPED) or certain disabled adaptations &mdash;  to be met at all times. The majority of Committee members also expect a good  and appropriate balance to be maintained in the delivery of the housing  programme&rsquo;s other objectives.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One other objective is the achievement of the decent homes  standard in social housing, which is mentioned in the original motion. As the  House will be aware, the Savills report, which is on the Minister&rsquo;s desk,  reportedly shows significant improvements in Housing Executive stock in that  regard. The Committee intends to review progress on the decent homes standard  when the Department makes the Savills report available to it. I encourage the  Minister to share with the House and the Committee the difficulties and  challenges that she faces and the successes that she has achieved with regard  to housing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will use the remaining time to make some comments in a  personal, party capacity. As I said in a Committee capacity, I fully  understand, appreciate and empathise with the budgetary difficulties that the  Minister faces, and I entirely understand the difficult situation that she was  put in and the choice that she had to make to move money around in her budget.  However, it is worth pointing out that doing that is not without consequence.  There are many consequences of moving money around in that way. The pressure is  biting really hard because we previously had a &pound;40 million tap of money that  flowed into renovations at a fairly steady rate each year.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That flow has not been reduced to a trickle: the tap has  been turned off completely. That is where the consequences and some of the pain  are coming from. That pain is being felt not only by those who are applying for  funds but by those who carry out the work; not big building firms but owners of  small businesses, some of whom would have been depending on two, three or four  small grants jobs each year for their livelihood.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  The Member, as Chairperson of the Committee for Social Development, seems to be  implying that the Minister should rearrange the budget internally. The Minister  has indicated that newbuild is a top priority, as are the warm homes scheme and  the Supporting People programme. The Member is suggesting that some of those  priorities should, in fact, be altered or their budgets reduced. Which of those  does Mr Hamilton, either as Chairperson of the Social Development Committee or  as an ordinary Member, suggest should be affected adversely?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Social Development</strong>: The Member knows that it is unfair  to ask that question of me as Chairperson of the Social Development Committee.  I have already made comments that the Member, I am sure, subscribes to  personally.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The point that I am getting at is that when the constant  flow of money stops dead, there are ramifications. Small businesses are  downsizing or are going out of business quietly as a result of this. They are  local family firms that employ local people and use local building supplies to  do their work. We cannot procure preferentially in any way, but we all know  that grants work benefits local firms first and foremost.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We need not turn the tap back on to &pound;40 million a year: it  is not possible to do that. However, some small infusion of cash back into the  renovations area would greatly assist those businesses and the people who  benefit from those schemes. Perhaps not &pound;40 million or even &pound;4 million:  &pound;400,000 would be better than what is going through the system at the moment.  It would let 20 small grants jobs go ahead, which is better than nothing, which  is the case at present.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Problems are being stored up for the future. I take the  Member&rsquo;s point about the other priorities. Nevertheless, there is an onus on  the Minister to ensure that, if in making those difficult choices at the end of  the financial year there is money left over in any of those schemes, and I have  particular concerns about the warm homes scheme and the slow start being made  by the new scheme &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member must bring his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Social Development</strong>: I know of one energy firm that has  made 82 referrals, of which only three have gone through so far. There are  issues developing, and it is absolutely necessary that the Minister ensures  that having made the difficult choices, all the available money is spent on  those other priorities. I welcome the debate.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Armstrong</strong>:  It is no secret that there is a major problem with the Executive&rsquo;s finances.  The Minister for Social Development has repeatedly highlighted difficulties in  her Department&rsquo;s budget, and in particular, the problems that have been caused  by the huge drop in revenue from house and land sales as property values have  plummeted and income from sales has dropped from &pound;100 million to &pound;8 million in  one year.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is all very well for some Members and their parties to  seek to attack the Minister as part of a political grandstanding exercise, but  she cannot create money out of thin air as if by magic. The Executive Budget,  never mind the DSD budget, is finite, and hard choices must be made, although  we would not think so when we listen to some Members. I am not here to attack  the Minister or her Department. I know that she wants to increase funding for  public housing stock, public- and private-sector home improvement schemes and  to combat fuel poverty. However, the problem is that we do not live in an ideal  world: we live in the real world.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion appears to be slightly confused in that it  refers to home improvement grants, which are for private homes, but goes on to  mention the decent homes standards, which apply to public-sector housing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On the first point, it is clear that there is a growing  crisis with regard to home improvements. The motion identifies an additional  &pound;20 million that was allocated to Housing Executive funds in the June  monitoring round. That may seem to be a large sum of money, but it would only  partly cover those grants in which formal letters of approval have been issued.  In other words, that money has already been spent, and the result is that no  new money is available for further grant aid.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Over 13,000 private homes have applied for grant aid, some  of which are in the final stages and are nearing approval. Over 9,000 of those  homes have received letters from the Northern Ireland Housing Executive  informing them that grant aid can no longer be provided. Furthermore, over 900  small and medium-sized family-based contracting firms, which have been actively  engaged in contracts involving the Housing Executive grant, face the prospect  of work drying up in early January 2010. With no approvals being issued, those  firms are facing closure. That will throw even more people onto the dole queue.  Even if contractors were redeployed to work on social housing projects, many of  them are only at the early stages of planning and will not be ready for  commencement until 2011.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I appeal to the Minister to do all she can to secure  funding to support grant aid in the private sector, and to alleviate the  genuine fears of those firms whose main business is drawn from the  private-sector grant schemes. As I said, I will not attack the Minister or her  Department, as I understand the financial situation in which she has to operate  and the difficult choices that have to be made. I urge her to look within her  budget to see what can be done to support home improvement grants in the  private sector and to meet the decent homes standards in the public sector.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The answer, as always, is more funding. If the Minister  cannot find that in her budget, Members from other parties must pressurise  their party colleagues in the Executive to allocate funds to the Social  Development Minister. There is no other way.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: One  of my constituents recently contacted my office seeking help. He had made a  statutory application for a Housing Executive improvement and repair grant. The  gentleman had already incurred associated costs of &pound;987 when he was informed by  the NIHE that his application would not be honoured, due to budget constraints.  This 60-year-old gentleman has endured living in a property in the Village area  without central heating or an indoor toilet for over 15 years. He was recently  made redundant from his long-term employment without any redundancy package,  and is suffering serious health problems, having had several heart attacks in  the past year.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Housing Executive reconsidered only after pressure from  other elected representatives and me, and was forced to introduce a set of  guidelines to deal with exceptional circumstances such as those of that  gentleman. People should not be left in limbo waiting for grants to improve  their unfit homes. That can have a very negative impact on their health and  well-being. Delays in repairing some properties can also make those homes  uninhabitable in the long run, thereby reducing the housing stock.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I call on the parties in the Executive to work together to  give DSD the housing budget necessary to carry out the many aspects of its  work. The Housing Executive is facing serious funding shortages of &pound;100 million  each year following the collapse of the housing market. The home improvement  grant has been curtailed, like so many other programmes, due to a shortage of  funds.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I recently attended a DSD public meeting when the Minister  was present. It was embarrassing to watch her appeal to members of the  audience, on several occasions, to lobby their elected representatives and  respective parties to put the Department on a sound financial footing. That is  indicative of what little support the Minister is getting from the Executive.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It took &lsquo;The Stephen Nolan Show&rsquo; to resolve the  difficulties of the SPED scheme. The situation is a disgrace, and when I spoke  to the police officer in question, I realised the stress that it has put on him  and his family. Last year, the Housing Executive spent more than &pound;9 million on  the SPED programme. This year&rsquo;s budget was only &pound;1&middot;5 million, to be increased  by scraps in monitoring rounds. That is no way to run any Department.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  Does the Member agree that the problem was experienced not only by one  ex-police officer but by a number of police officers? Indeed, other members of  the public found themselves in exactly the same position. Extra resources are  needed to meet those people&rsquo;s demands.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: I  absolutely agree.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Does the Member agree that the two main parties&rsquo; failure to give leadership in  tackling sectarianism is partly at the core of the problem?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: I  absolutely agree.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">People do not really care what Department is responsible  for what. I think that the layperson on the street does not know what  Department does what. All people want is for the Government to deliver public  services to meet the needs of their citizens. Marginalising one or two  Ministers from the smaller parties merely shows up the lack of cohesion in the  Executive, who are so often playing party politics rather than working together  for the common good.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The housing downturn was not the Minister&rsquo;s fault. We must  ensure that, in future, funding for important and much-needed schemes, such as  the SPED scheme and the home improvement grants, are secure and not subject to  fluctuating incomes from the receipt of house and land sales.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hilditch</strong>:  I support the motion, and I welcomed the Minister&rsquo;s announcement back in July.  More than 20,000 people are deemed to be in housing stress, and 9,000 are  registered as homeless. On top of that, 17% of our housing stock is below the  decent homes standard. Investment is required to replace properties&rsquo; obsolete  and inefficient systems and functions. I understood that the &pound;20 million that  was awarded in the June monitoring round was to allow for the necessary maintenance  work to proceed while providing important support for the construction sector  in these difficult times.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McCann took us on a geographical tour of the west of the  Province, but we could all give examples from our own constituencies, including  those in the east. On my doorstep, an area of social deprivation in Castlemara  has been hit particularly hard and has had a number of maintenance schemes and  cycle maintenance cancelled. The suspension of home improvement grants comes on  top of that. Indeed, constituents have been told not only that there is no  funding but that they will have to reapply when money becomes available again.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Many of those people are in vulnerable positions: they are  unable to move away from Housing Executive property or to purchase properties  elsewhere. Now they are being told that they cannot have the grants that are  necessary to complete priority maintenance work. Like many constituents &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McQuillan</strong>:  Does the Member agree that people who were approved for a home improvement grant  are worse off now than they were previously? Those people have gone to the  expense of getting plans drawn up and had planning applications ready to  submit. Some of those people will be out of pocket and will be up to &pound;1,000  worse off than they were before they started.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hilditch</strong>:  That is accurate, and I intended to refer to that matter later.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  The Member said that applicants would have to reapply for grants. I understand  from the Department that applicants will not have to reapply. Rather, their  applications are effectively frozen.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hilditch</strong>:  In researching today&rsquo;s speech, I obtained some information from the grants  office in Ballyclare. If it is not correct, I am sorry.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">All Members know about individual cases. Last night, I had  an opportunity to visit an elderly woman who has spent two winters with rain  coming in through the front windows of her house. Now that her application has  been turned down again, she is not looking forward to a third such winter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In my East Antrim  constituency alone, 244 grants have been cancelled and 67 applications for home  repair refused. I was horrified to learn that 94 renovation grants for  properties that have been deemed unfit have also been refused. That means that  94 homes throughout the constituency are occupied despite their being unsafe.  People&rsquo;s lives are at risk because those dwellings are dangerous and in need of  urgent repairs, such as rewiring, roof work, extensions, plastering, and so  forth. To make matters worse, some of those households, as my colleague said,  have been further penalised through having already paid for plans for  extensions to be drawn up. The Housing Executive has offered no reimbursement  for that expense.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am thankful that the disabled facilities grant scheme  will continue. However, more than 13,000 private homeowners have applied for  grant aid, and some of their applications were at the final stages or nearing  approval. Despite that, 9,000 of those applicants received letters from the  Housing Executive to inform them that grant aid is no longer being provided.  That is unacceptable. This year, the Housing Executive will approve only 2,000  grants approximately. Given that it approved some 7,000 last year, that is a  shocking reduction.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Everyone has the right to live in a safe home, and it is  unreasonable and unjust to concentrate solely on the provision of newbuilds. If  the Northern Ireland Housing Executive is to remain committed to bringing all  homes up to the decent homes standard by 2010, it is imperative that the  Minister concentrates on both issues. The Housing Executive must be dedicated  to providing quality housing services, and it must work with others to create  safe and confident communities. It must take into account the importance of  improvements and repairs, as well as address the needs of the homeless.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I ask the Minister to revoke the suspension of the grants  and move towards supporting the construction industry. The crisis cannot be  ignored, and the Depart&shy;ment must start to approve grants again. Otherwise, the  future of Housing Executive offices and their staff will be at risk, private  housing is likely to deteriorate further and the companies of the contractors  involved will face closure. I support the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. If Members compare Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s  motion with the SDLP amendment, only one word differs. The amendment replaces  &ldquo;remove&rdquo; with &ldquo;review&rdquo;. What does review mean? It could apply to a review  lasting three weeks, three years, or for ever. Although that one word is the  only difference between the motion and the amendment, it is unclear and  jeopardises the entire motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  The SDLP is not in the habit of using the same definition of the word as Sinn  F&eacute;in, when it referred to the reviews of the programme of cohesion, sharing and  integration, of the anti-poverty strategy or of the Civic Forum. In contrast to  Sinn F&eacute;in, the SDLP has time frames.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. I thank the Member for that point of information. Although  Dolores may think otherwise, the matter that is being debated is important, and  we should not be getting it mixed up with any other issues. It never fails to  amaze me how Dolores manages to introduce sectarian issues, as happened earlier  when she raised a point of order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  When?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  The subject matter was slightly different, but she talked about how the two  main parties on the Executive and in the Chamber are not dealing with  sectarianism effectively.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Sinn F&eacute;in motion refers to &ldquo;essential maintenance and  home improvements&rdquo;. The key word is &ldquo;essential&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some of that was mentioned. I think that Simon Hamilton  touched on the figure, but the fact is that it was cut down, seemingly as a  matter of urgency. It did not seem that any real thought went into closing the  door. Perhaps the Minister has not given the right direction to her staff in  the grants offices because people have received letters that state that the  grant scheme is closed and that they will have to reapply.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">During a telephone conversation, I was told by a member of  staff that the scheme will probably never even be opened up again. Perhaps the  Minister could give better direction to her Department&rsquo;s staff.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  In connection with what the Member said, and in response to Mr Maginness&rsquo;s  point, I have a letter from the Housing Executive that very clearly states that  people will have to make a further application if grant aid becomes available  in the future.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  It seems that all of the points from the rest of the Members and parties in  this Chamber back that view. That is the message that quite clearly is coming  from the Minister&rsquo;s Department. The Minister refuses to recognise that point,  but a number of her party colleagues have questioned whether that is the case.  Perhaps better direction needs to come from the Minister on that issue.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  I have one question about exceptional circumstances that I want the Minister to  address. The Housing Executive&rsquo;s website states that it expects that  applications for discretionary grants may be approved only in exceptional  circumstances. We are talking about the current state of play.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a lady who lives in Carrickmore, County Tyrone,  who has twice been a victim of the conflict. She recently had an intruder in  her home, and her repair grant application is to secure her back door. There is  an 80-year-old lady from Mountfield, County   Tyrone, whose guttering  is rotting away. She is fearful of infestation of mice and rats, and she is  cold in the winter months. I want the Minister to give an assurance that she  will review cases such as those here and now so that they will qualify as  exceptional circumstances because, all too often, MLAs are being told that  exceptional circumstances do not apply.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  I thank the Member for that intervention. On no fewer than six occasions during  Question Time today, the Minister stated that the housing budget needs to be  placed on a sound financial footing. That is exactly right, and every single  Department in the Executive has to ensure that all of its moneys are on a sound  financial footing. If they fail to do that and fail to work the system in a  proper way, they are accountable to the elected Members of this Chamber and to  the entire community outside.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have heard more money being asked for in this Chamber  before. Does it come out of the health budget, or does it come out of the  education or roads budgets? What budget should it come out of? That is the  question that the Minister has to answer because it must be remembered that all  of us have to answer to all of our constituents. In recent times, I have had a  number of people in my office because of the door being slammed in their faces  when it comes to the grants that they had applied for.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member should draw his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  Those constituents had been brought to the wire and they had been promised  those grants, yet they were refused.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  I support my party&rsquo;s amendment to the motion. We have before us an impossible  situation that has been caused by a &pound;100 million shortfall in the housing  budget. That shortfall was brought about by the economic downturn, and  everybody should remember that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am well aware that there are huge pressures on the  Finance Minister&rsquo;s bank balance. However, the simple fact is staring us all in  the face. Although Sinn F&eacute;in would have us believe otherwise, the housing  budget is inefficient, ineffective and is unfairly portrayed. I applaud the  Finance Minister for giving &pound;20 million in the June monitoring round to the  Department for Social Development. However, that merely fed the historical  black hole that already existed due to the Department for Social Development  starting the financial year from behind because of deficits that were caused by  the collapse in land and house sales, as assets could not be sold at a good  price. The case today is the same as it was last year, and the Minister will  make that case again today. Hopefully, her plight will be listened to this  time.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, for those who need it spelled out, the bottom line  is that the housing budget is totally unfit for purpose, even though the  Minister has suggested ways forward that might help.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A motion such as this serves as a pathetic point-scoring  exercise. Yesterday, we heard the Education Minister ask the Assembly to work  with her to move forward. The SDLP is asking for the same sentiment to be  afforded to the Social Development Minister. The Executive exist to create a  better quality &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  No, I will not give way. The Executive exist to create a better quality of life  for the people of Northern    Ireland. Surely, one of the most basic  rights is to have a decent roof over your head. I ask Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP, as  the majority &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I did not say anything when Mr McCann was speaking. Please  have manners.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am asking Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP, as the majority vote  holders in the Executive to put their money, literally, where their mouths are  and give the Minister what she needs to make that provision a reality for those  people who need the help of home improvement grants.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Does the Member agree, and I am sure that her ministerial colleague does, that  we have heard Assembly debates ad nauseam about housing grants and affordable  housing &mdash; so many that you could paper the Chamber with Hansard reports of them  &mdash; with commitments left, right and centre? Maybe, left and right, depending on  how the political axis is viewed at the minute.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, to re-emphasise the point, if Sinn F&eacute;in and the  DUP are interested in putting their money where their mouths are, could they  put it into the most practical form of affordable housing to help people by way  of a home repairs grant, a renovation grant or a replacement grant at minimal  cost to the public purse? Will the Member accept that point and reflect it in  the debate?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  I certainly will, I agree with that point. My office is inundated, as are many  others, with constituents who have suffered due to the grant process being  restricted. I can see only one way out. If we are to help those who voted for  us, they and the parties must know that the DSD cupboard is bare because of  external factors.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister is not a magician. She can work only with what  she has. It is obvious to me that we should all support her efforts to seek  further funding, rather than score points at the behest of our constituents. We  should deal with constituents&rsquo; problems by supporting the housing budget. To  use Paul Maskey&rsquo;s word, it is &ldquo;essential&rdquo; that everybody in the Chamber  supports the Minister and her housing budget.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Last year, we heard Mr Fra McCann tell the Minister to stop whingeing and take  the money, but the Minister fought on and got additional money for her budget.  Thankfully, she did not listen to Sinn F&eacute;in that time round, and I am quite  sure that she will not listen to Sinn F&eacute;in this time round.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is clear from the debate that Sinn F&eacute;in intends to carry  on this term the same way that it left off in June: attack the sole SDLP  Minister without once directing any of its anger or concerns at the Minister of  Finance and Personnel, who has refused the Minister for Social Development any  additional funding to relieve the housing budget. As far back as December, Sinn  F&eacute;in would not allow the Minister to reallocate her own &pound;38 million within her  Department to meet housing need.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  I have a question that I would love to have answered, if possible. Did any of  the &pound;20 million given to the Minister for Social development in the June  monitoring round go to Housing Executive grants offices in Omagh and Derry, for  example, where I have constituents who are anxiously trying to get redress?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I am sure that the Minister herself will answer that question. However, on that  point, I have a copy of a letter dated 30 June 2009 from Sinn F&eacute;in Minister  Michelle Gildernew to the Finance Minister. In it, the Sinn F&eacute;in Minister  wrote:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;I am perplexed by the proposal to increase the  capital overcommittment by &pound;20m in respect of housing improvements for DSD.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">No support came from Sinn F&eacute;in in the Executive on  that occasion. The letter continues:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Whilst I am sure that this bid has substantial  merits, the paper does not spell out why this particular bid should be met at  the expense of any other capital bid, and there is no compelling rationale as  to why we should make an exception&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Shame, shame, shame on Sinn F&eacute;in and Michelle  Gildernew for not supporting the SDLP in the Executive when Margaret Ritchie  was looking for money. Everyone in the House ought to know, because the  Minister has told them often enough &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  In a moment. There are substantial restraints on where that &pound;20 million can be  spent. Of course I will give way to Mr Maskey.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  I have not heard or seen that information, so I am wondering where it came  from. Maybe she is just making it up, or is it confidential stuff from the  Executive that should not be given out?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I assure the House that I am not a tout. I do not inform on sources. As far as  I am aware, there are no touts in our party, unlike some parties, which have  major concerns about informers in their midst. Indeed, the document is not  marked confidential, but it is a matter of record, and I hope that it will be  read into the record. Perhaps Mr Maskey would do better to ask Michelle  Gildernew why she would not support the SDLP Minister for Social Development in  meeting the real and pressing needs of people in housing stress.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. The Member keeps quoting information  that nobody else is aware of. To put the record straight, at every Executive  meeting when monitoring rounds have come up, Sinn F&eacute;in has fully supported  additional money going to the housing budget to deal with the DSD&rsquo;s problems.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Kelly</strong>:  Mr Deputy Speaker, I do not think that that was a point of order. That is the  same Member who, only a matter of months ago &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am aware that, on previous occasions,  Speakers have ruled with respect to documents that Members have referred to  during debates and that the reference document must be verified. All that we  are asking is whether the document is an Executive paper and whether the Member  is prepared to lodge it in the Assembly Library.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Perhaps we can allow the Member to answer your question.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  With respect, Mr Deputy Speaker, I raised the point of order with you. On  previous occasions, rulings have been made on that subject.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Yes, but it is necessary for the Member to say whether she is  willing to lodge the document in the Library.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I am more than happy to lodge the document in the Library, and to allow all and  sundry to read it and see Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s real purpose in the Executive, which is  to attack the SDLP in the hope that it will fail in its Ministry. While  Margaret Ritchie remains as the SDLP Minister, there is no chance of that  happening, and I have every confidence in her being the shining star in the  Executive that she is today, and will be tomorrow. I seem to have hit a sore  point with Sinn F&eacute;in Members, so they really should take the matter up with  Michelle Gildernew.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are ways to spend money more efficiently and  effectively, and that is exactly what Margaret Ritchie has done in respect of  the Housing Executive. For example, she told Housing Executive officials to use  brownfield sites and existing housing land to ensure that there is less cost to  the public purse. Margaret Ritchie is driving efficiencies and effectiveness  through the Housing Executive to the best of her ability, and often, as Mr  Deputy Speaker knows, her efforts are being held up and not supported by the  so-called main nationalist republican party in the House, which tries to say  that it speaks for the most vulnerable people in society. The SDLP started out  speaking on housing matters and for the most vulnerable and marginalised people  in society, and, next year, we will go into our fortieth anniversary on the  same platform: ensuring that the most marginalised people in our society are  protected.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  I am sure that most of us are deeply concerned about the needs of our  constituents; I hope that that is the case. I also hope that Sinn F&eacute;in will  reconsider the strategy that it is employing. Many people are being held up and  cannot get grant aid. Many people are looking to have houses built. If we had a  bit more co-operation in this place, yesterday and today, we would have been  faced with an Executive showcasing to the world what they are doing for the  people of the North, rather than having silly and juvenile debates.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Let us have a bit of co-operation at Executive level. Let  us see delivery for those who really count: the people, including those who  have applications in the grants system.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Mrs Kelly, your time has run out.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Oh dear.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: I  share a lot of the concerns that Sinn F&eacute;in has raised in relation to the  suspension of the housing grants scheme. Most Members share those concerns. I  am willing, or I was willing, to consider the notion of a review, but I am  slightly worried by what I have just heard, because it sounds increasingly as  though the issue is no longer about a review but about people digging in and  taking entrenched positions. I am not sure that that is helpful. I am waiting  for the Minister&rsquo;s reassurance that if we say that something should be reviewed  there is a commitment to review it. As Dolores Kelly rightly pointed out, the  word &ldquo;review&rdquo; is often a euphemism in the Assembly for doing nothing. The  public do not want that: they want a proper review in the light of all the  information.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The other thing that impresses me about the debate, and  others like it, is Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s almost relentless pursuit of the DSD Minister on  every issue. If that energy were put into working with the other parties in the  Executive to create better collectivity, we would be able to move forward a lot  faster, and the public might be more impressed by the Executive that are  representing them.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  thank the Member for giving way. All of us in the Chamber are hard-nosed  politicians, including the Minister for Social Development. If any Minister is  not a hard-nosed politician, he or she should not be a Minister. I know that  the media have portrayed the Minister as &ldquo;Saint Margaret of DSD&rdquo;, but, at the  end of the day, Margaret Ritchie is a Minister who has to be held to account by  the Executive. As regards funding for DSD, if anyone wishes to read Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s  submission on the Budget, it states clearly that Sinn F&eacute;in would support extra  funding for social housing &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: I  thank Mr O&rsquo;Dowd for what he said. I come from a particular tradition that is  not really into sainthood, but we are not into relentlessly demonising people  either. This is about looking at the issues on their merits. Nobody who  objectively analyses the number of issues brought to the Chamber by Sinn F&eacute;in  that are directly related to DSD could miss the point that it has been  relentless in its pursuit and criticism.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is also not fair to say, despite my reservations about  the suspension of the grants programme, that the DSD Minister has been the  worst performing Minister in the Executive. That is telling, because if people  were pursuing other Ministers with the same relentless passion when they are  not performing, we might get more out the other end of the Executive.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>:  No, I will not give way, because I want to finish what I have to say.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to focus on the issue, which is the impact that this  has had. I hope that the Minister will consider a review. The debate was  slightly pre-empted by Question Time. However, I listened to the Minister, and  she said that she had focused on protecting the vulnerable. That is very  worthy, and I can understand that in difficult budgetary constraints it is what  she must do. However, some of the people we are dealing with in this discussion  about the grants are vulnerable people who also need to be protected. There has  to be some balance between building new houses and maintaining the housing  stock that we already have. The pendulum has, perhaps, swung too far.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">For those who clamour about where the money would come  from, we need to look, realistically, at freeing up what are relatively small  amounts of money for the grants scheme from the newbuild scheme, if necessary,  in order to provide an opportunity to maintain the housing stock. We can expand  the housing stock, and we can be more cost effective in how we do that, if we  can maintain, adapt and renovate existing properties or those properties that  are falling out of use and bring them back online more quickly. There is also  the danger that if it is not done, the cost of doing it down the line, when the  scheme reopens, will be a lot greater because the properties will be in a worse  state of repair. There are also knock-on effects for neighbouring properties in  many cases, particularly mid-terrace properties. For example, when roofs start  to leak when a terraced house becomes abandoned, and there are all sorts of  other issues, that has an implication for the rest of the houses in that  terrace. There are also issues about how quickly uninhabited houses can be  restored to full use.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The suspension of the payment of home improvement grants  can impact on the waiting list, because if people cannot adapt their homes to  their needs, they will join the waiting list and seek a home that suits their  needs. Those two issues are not separate. They are linked in that the people  who will join the waiting list will be people whose homes could be adapted if  the money and support were available. Therefore, there needs to be a balance on  this issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The impact that living conditions have on the health and  well-being of individuals is crucial, which Anna Lo and other Members  mentioned. I am concerned about that. There are also financial implications,  and a number of Members have spoken about the professional fees that people  have incurred when making their applications. There are also people who bought  properties, which required modernisation to make them habitable, on the  understanding that they would be able to rent out those properties and return  them to the market. Those people are also incurring costs from properties that  cannot be let. They still have to pay their fees, and they will suffer from not  being able to get insurance if they cannot return them to a habitable state.  There are all sorts of other wider financial implications. Such issues need to  be addressed.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member should bring her remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>:  The impact on industry has been touched on, but, as a result of this debate, I  would like the Minister to indicate that she is willing to review the  suspension of the grants and other Members to indicate that they are willing to  co-operate.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I call on the saintly Minister for Social Development, Ms Margaret  Ritchie.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development (Ms Ritchie)</strong>: I thank the Members who contributed to the  debate, and I welcome the opportunity to respond to those contributions, not  least because it gives me the opportunity to clarify and correct some of the  issues that were raised. I will try to address all the questions and points  that Members raised, and I assure the House that I will study the Hansard  report and write to any Member who has raised an issue that is not covered in  my response.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion asks me to explain why the Housing Executive has  suspended the payment of home improvement grants, despite being awarded an  extra &pound;20 million in the June monitoring round. I am happy to provide that  explanation. The SDLP amendment has asked me to review the position on that  suspension of grants, and I am happy to do that as well.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the opportunity to talk to Members again about  the difficulties that I face, because they are all aware that, due to the  downturn in house and land sales, the housing budget started this year with a  &pound;100 million shortfall, which has impacted on all spending programmes. I remind  the House that I started last year with a shortfall of &pound;80 million. Difficult  decisions have had to be made, and the Housing Executive has had no choice but  to prioritise its expenditure in all budget areas. The outcome of that is that  it has ultimately affected the delivery of certain housing programmes. In those  circumstances &mdash; and I emphasise this &mdash; I have listened to the political  grandstanding this afternoon, and I question whether certain Members are really  interested in the vulnerable and in wee Maggie down the lane who is waiting for  an improvement grant. I sympathise with that sort of person, because I live in  the countryside, and I know what it is like to have to wait for an improvement  grant.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: No. I will not, because Members have given way already.  I want to continue and explain the problem. That is what is wrong; people do  not want to listen to the problem. They want to politically grandstand and  attack rather than help.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have done my utmost to protect the most vulnerable  households by ring-fencing budgets for newbuild social housing to help those in  housing stress; for the warm homes scheme to help those in fuel poverty; and in  support of people living independently in the community rather than in  institutions. I have heard Members from around the House say that that is what  they want as well.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have also decided on the provision of newbuild social  housing within the social housing development programme. It is a priority,  because the current market conditions are more suited than ever before to  increase investment in social housing, to stimulate the economy, to protect  jobs in the overall construction industry and to help the most vulnerable and  needy in society by providing them with a home.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a falsehood out there that I have somehow diverted  money from the provision of grants, and I heard Fra McCann saying that today.  It is a pity that he does not listen better at the meetings of the Social  Development Committee; perhaps then he might have some answers. There is a  falsehood out there that I have somehow diverted money away from grants, and  from other parts of my Department&rsquo;s budget, to concentrate solely on the  provision of newbuild social housing. I can categorically state that that is  not true.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Let me say it again: I have protected only three areas from  the full impact of the &pound;100 million shortfall, and the Housing Executive has  had to absorb pressures right across the housing budget. However, there has  been no diversion to social newbuilds. What was given to Members yesterday in  documents sent by a certain gentleman, representing a certain organisation, was  a misrepresentation of the facts.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, as I have said, difficult decisions have had to be  made. As the level of funding available for home improvements in the private  sector is insufficient, applications for discretionary grants, including  renovation grants, replacement grants and home repairs assistance, may now be  approved only in exceptional circumstances. However, I have ensured that other  grants such as disabled facilities grants, which provide adaptations to enable  disabled people to remain in their own homes, and repair grants approved on  foot of statutory notices given by district councils will continue to operate  normally.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In such difficult circumstances, I welcomed the Executive&rsquo;s  decision to make &pound;20 million available for social housing in the June  monitoring round. I have ensured &mdash; to answer some queries made, I believe, by  Barry McElduff &mdash; that &pound;15 million has been allocated to private-sector grants  and &pound;5 million has been allocated to disabled adaptations. However, as Members  will know, that &pound;20 million addresses only part of what is a &pound;100 million  shortfall in the housing budget, and I must continue to bid in future  monitoring rounds to protect the housing agenda.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members may not be aware that the additional funding is  conditional on the release of &pound;20 million from the existing resources to Egan  contractors, who carry out maintenance works such as kitchen replacements on  Housing Executive properties. The Executive are perfectly within their rights  to attach conditions to the release of &pound;20 million to housing, but in this  instance, and for someone trying to manage the budget proactively, those  conditions were not helpful. In order for the Housing Executive to release the  &pound;20 million for Egan contracts, it had to cut back other planned maintenance  and related works. Effectively, I was given &pound;20 million and asked to fund &pound;40  million &mdash; &pound;20 million for Egan contracts, and &pound;20 million for grants and  disability adaptations &mdash; from the June monitoring round allocation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Historically, there has been a time lag between grants  being approved and the eventual application for payment, which has resulted in  a significant commit&shy;ment being built up in the grants system. As a result of  the economic downturn, the availability of builders has meant that previously  approved grants are now resulting in payment requests being received sooner.  Therefore, the additional funding allocated in the June monitoring round will  only allow the Housing Executive to meet commitments for private-sector grant  applications which have already received formal approval, and to fund the  statutory grant approvals this year. However, I have ensured that any cancelled  or refused grant applications will be held on file in the place they were in  the queue against the event that additional funding becomes available at some  future date. I have also ensured that the Housing Executive writes to all  applicants who have had their applications cancelled or refused, to explain the  approach to be taken.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">David Hilditch raised an issue that he had taken on board  from the Ballyclare grants office, and Francie Molloy raised a similar issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If Members know of cases where people have not received  those letters, please let me know. My instructions were that nobody was to lose  their place in the queue and nobody had to reapply. I want to make that  absolutely clear.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I know that many people have been disappointed by the  non-approval of their grant, but they will not have wasted their efforts in  bringing their applications to an advanced stage. Many people are out of pocket  on various consultancy, architect and civil engineering fees advancing their  grant applications, and many of those people are on low incomes. As I advised  my colleague Patsy McGlone earlier during Question Time, I am looking at what  can be done to help those people ahead of their grants receiving final  approval. I hope that I get the support for that scheme when it comes forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I sincerely hope that the Housing Executive&rsquo;s restriction  on grants will be temporary. I hope that I will be able to help everybody whose  applications are in the pipeline. I bid for additional funds in the September  monitoring round, which will allow the Housing Executive to approve the grants  received this year, and which it has not been able to process due to a lack of  funding.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Many issues were raised during the debate. At one stage, I  thought that Mr McCann was in a state of confusion, because he mixed up  improvement grants with Egan contractors and planned maintenance.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Not in the least.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: He sounded confused to me, because they are distinct  issues. However, it might be better if Mr McCann were to encourage his  colleagues to support me round the Executive table to put housing on a sound  financial footing. His words would be put to more profitable use if he were to  deploy them to that end.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank Mr Burns for his helpful comments. Simon Hamilton  recognised the frustration that many people have about improvement grants,  which I also recognise. I note, sadly, that as Chairperson of the Committee, he  is not in his usual place. I agree with him that many of those issues are not  without their consequences. He raised the issue of the warm homes scheme, and I  addressed that during Question Time when I said that everybody in the pipeline  will be dealt with by scheme managers and everybody should be contacted by  November. I would like to think that that will happen earlier, and I will be  urging them to do so.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that the Chairperson and the Deputy Chairperson of the  Committee will provide strong support and urge their ministerial colleagues in  the DUP to put housing on that illusive sound financial footing. Why do we want  that? For too long the funding of housing has been predicated on capital  receipts. However, capital receipts have now dissipated, as has the level of  house sales. In this new financial situation, which was pointed out by my  colleagues in our document &lsquo;New Priorities in Difficult Times&rsquo;, we need to look  at housing to ensure that it is put on a sound financial footing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the support of Billy Armstrong and Anna Lo, and I  sympathise with her constituent. Many of us have constituents who have found  themselves in such difficulties, and I echo her clarion call to put housing on  a sound financial footing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have already answered David Hilditch&rsquo;s question about the  Ballyclare grants office. Anna Lo also raised the issue of people who have  spent money on architects&rsquo; fees. We are dealing with that issue and I hope that  I will be able to come forward with a clearly worked-up scheme.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that Mr McCann will urge his Sinn F&eacute;in ministerial  colleagues in the Executive to support me in putting housing on a sound  financial footing rather than carping and trying to make a political football  out of people&rsquo;s misery and suffering. Dolores Kelly is absolutely right: I  remember in October 2007 Mr McCann saying me that I should accept my lot and  stop whinging. He then changes his tune to suit the political moment, save for  the fact that he does not always have his facts correct.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Paul Maskey raised an issue and, again, there seems to have  been some misinformation, which I have already corrected.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Barry McElduff raised the issue of exceptional circumstances.  The criteria used to determine exceptional circumstances are clearly laid out.  An exceptional circumstance is one in which an imminent and significant health  and safety risk exists; a serious risk under structural stability exists, or  any other circumstance that is considered to be exceptional exists. There is a  simultaneous application for disabled facilities and renovations, and where  works are required, the adaption is allowed to proceed. If Mr McElduff knows of  applications that fulfil those criteria and have not been properly addressed, I  suggest that he refers them to me and I will ensure that they are assessed  again. Such matters should be addressed in a totally professional, adult and  mature manner.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Patsy McGlone and Mary Bradley raised the issue of  affordable housing and the need for funding. I could not agree more that there  must be an investment of resources, that housing should be put on a sound  financial footing, and that the needs and suffering of people should be  recognised. Dolores Kelly put in a sterling performance and referred to the  fact that I am stretching my budget like an elastic band, that we are  witnessing a miracle akin to that of the loaves and fishes, and that I have  been doing things with the budget to prove that it can be stretched.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">First, we can increase the level of resources by securing  further financial commitments from the Executive. We can also be innovative  through the transfer of sites, leasing and other measures. I would appreciate  the support of the House in securing additional funding for housing. The  problem is an overall lack of finance, not a lack of desire to provide all  private-sector grants and enable essential maintenance and home-improvement  works.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Minister&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: The answer is not to rob the vulnerable to pay another  group, which some people want me to do.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Minister&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: We must secure more resources in total for housing. Let  me be absolutely clear: there is not enough money for housing, and I look  forward to the full support of the House to achieve that goal.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I have a feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu in relation to the debate, because we have seen  many previous attacks on the Minister for Social Development. The motion is no  more than a thinly veiled attack on the Minister. Naomi Long and other Members  have indicated that, in fact &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I will, very quickly.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  You and Naomi Long have made that point. What you are both actually saying is  that if I, as the housing spokesperson for Sinn F&eacute;in, have any major complaints  about the way the Minister runs her Department, I should not bring them up  because they might annoy you, her, or your party.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I will repeat the point: if Margaret Ritchie of the SDLP were not the Minister  for Social Development, the motion is unlikely to have reached the Floor of the  House. That is the situation.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>:  Does the Member agree that if Mr McCann, as housing spokesperson for Sinn F&eacute;in,  were genuinely concerned about housing issues, we would all accept his right to  raise them with the Minister, and, indeed, with his party colleagues who are  Ministers in the same Executive, and with other Ministers, who would be able to  give the Minister support so that she could get the money?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  Naomi Long has made it very plain. Not the SDLP, but the Alliance Party, and  indeed Billy Armstrong, have made it very plain that the motion and debate are  part of the relentless pursuit of the Minister for Social Development. That is  the situation. The Minister has made it very clear that she is under severe  budgetary pressures. She has effectively lost &pound;100 million of funding. I ask  Sinn F&eacute;in: in similar circumstances, could a Minister from its party perform as  well as the current Minister has performed, and would its Minister &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. It has got to the stage where I am having difficulty  hearing. Members should make their remarks through the Chair.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I will speak more loudly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Any other Minister, faced with a loss of &pound;100 million in  funding, would be presented with the same difficulties. The Minister has said  that there are three priorities: the warm homes scheme, the Supporting People  programme, and newbuild housing. From which of those priorities is the Minister  to take in order to provide grants? In this situation, additional funding for  the Department for Social Development is required so that the legitimate  concerns of all our constituents can be met. We should all support the Minister  in demanding that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Have we heard one word of criticism from Sinn F&eacute;in of the  Department of Finance or the Finance Minister? No; not one. That is because the  motion is part of a political vendetta against the SDLP Minister. Innumerable  motions have been brought by Mr McCann and his colleagues against the Minister,  for which the only reason is political. It is not to defend the vulnerable &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  It is not to improve things for people &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  It is to attack the Minister and the SDLP because the Minister is performing  well &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  And because the Minister has had an outstanding record.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. When it is obvious that a Member is not willing to give  way, another Member should not persist in asking.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I have given way; we do not get time added when making a winding-up speech.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank Anno Lo, Naomi Long, Billy Armstrong and my  colleagues for supporting the Minister on this issue. What is now required is  for the House to support the SDLP amendment, which asks for a thorough review  so that we can get to grips with and resolve this problem in the same way as  the special purchase of evicted dwellings problem was solved last week. That  was done by two Ministers &mdash; the Minister of Finance and Personnel, Sammy  Wilson, and the Minister for Social Development &mdash; coming together and working  out that issue. However, that needs the support of all Members and all parties  in the Assembly. I hope that people would not be perverse in pursuing a  party-political attack on, or vendetta against, a Minister, to the detriment of  the interests of their constituents. We want to resolve the issue for  vulnerable people, not make the situation worse.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Member to bring his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  All I ask is that colleagues are supportive and not critical of the Minister  for Social Development in these circumstances and that they support the  Minister so that she can get the extra funding that everyone wants her to.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I call Mr Mickey Brady to make a winding-up speech. I ask all  Members please to give him the Floor.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. From the content of the debate so  far, it is clear that the issue of grants being stopped is a serious one. Private-sector  grants deal directly with unfitness and include replacement grants and  potential unfitness with home-assistance repair grants. All those grants are  means-tested and applicants have to prove their financial hardship. The grants  are targeted at those homeowners who have no disposable income and they are  primarily designed to ensure that owners and residents of substandard private  accommodation can acquire a decent standard of fit accommodation and remain in  their homes. That will reduce the increasing burden on public-sector housing.  Surely that is reason alone to ensure that the grants are prioritised.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The number of fit newbuild properties is decreasing  dramatically, and as a consequence of the decision to stop grants, unfitness in  the private sector will increase. The withdrawal of grant funding will cause  unemployment, as such funding generated approximately 700-plus jobs in the  construction industry, across all the trades and among component suppliers to  that industry.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">People who live in poor housing experience poor health and  poor standards of living generally, and that affects their daily lives. Housing  fitness needs to be made a priority and needs to be actively pursued.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister, in responding to the debate, talked about  vulnerable people and how sympathetic she is. However, at a recent public  meeting in Newry that was hosted by the Minister for Social Development, I was  appalled by the cavalier attitude of the Minister and her party colleagues.  Some people who had come to the meeting to explain the dreadful condition of  their homes &mdash; the dampness and disrepair &mdash; were heckled and ridiculed by an  SDLP MLA and a number of SDLP councillors.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>:  No, I will not give way; I was at the meeting and the Member was not.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP representatives were not prepared to listen to, or  sympathise with, people whose living conditions are dire and unacceptable.  Given the tenor of Mrs Kelly&rsquo;s contribution today, it still seems to be a  source of amusement to her that those people continue to live in those dire  conditions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in has always supported bids for more money for  social housing, and it has supported the Minister, a fact of which she is well  aware.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Of  course I will.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Does the Member agree that there is an onus on all Ministers to be proactive in  looking for moneys that are not there? In the Minister&rsquo;s answer to my earlier  question about her discussions with the credit union organisation, which has  indicated that it could provide a substantial sum of money for the social  housing programme, she stated that she met that organisation several months  ago, which is not acceptable. Does the Member agree that the Minister needs to  be more proactive in chasing that funding?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>:  During the debate, several Members mentioned the substandard conditions in  which people are living, and the types of repairs that are required, such as  fixing leaking roofs and windows. Mr McCann referred to that issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Thomas Burns talked about the global economic downturn,  which we all know about. He also said that Sammy Wilson, apparently, clearly  understands the SDLP arguments. I am glad that someone does.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>:  No, I will not. Simon Hamilton, speaking as Chairperson of the Committee for  Social Development &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. During Mr Brady&rsquo;s contribution, he  referred to me. I was the only SDLP MLA present at the DSD meeting in Newry. He  made an unfounded and spurious attack on me. I think that I deserve the right  to answer.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: That is not a point of order, but it can be referred to the  Speaker.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Simon Hamilton, as Chairperson of the  Committee for Social Development, talked about the problems that the Committee  and, indeed, the Department are facing because of the lack of funding. He made  an appropriate point that there has to be a balance in the delivery of housing  standards, and that budgeting difficulties &mdash; in the sense of moving money  around &mdash; are not without consequences.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Billy Armstrong was something of a cheerleader for the  Minister, so I will simply pass on his points. Anna Lo mentioned specific cases  in her constituency, to which we can all relate. David Hilditch spoke about  there being 20,000 people in housing stress and 17% of housing stock being  below decent homes standards; that is an appalling statistic. Where is the &pound;20  million that was allocated from the monitoring round for construction and the  alleviation of social deprivation?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister was asked about the issue of reapplying.  People come into my constituency office with letters from the Housing Executive  that state that they have to reapply. Perhaps the Minister should, and could,  clarify that issue with her officials.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Paul Maskey talked about the difference between the words  &ldquo;remove&rdquo; and &ldquo;review&rdquo;. There is a vast difference. In her intervention, Dolores  Kelly went into the semantics of defining the word &ldquo;review&rdquo;. To be perfectly  honest, I am not quite sure what she was on about, but if she did not know  herself, that probably explains it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mary Bradley said that the housing budget was not fit for  purpose. We all sympathise with the fact that not enough money is there, but it  has to be recognised that money is not available.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Dolores Kelly talked about Mr McCann whingeing and about  his attack on the SDLP Minister. That is par for the course at the moment. I  ask the same question that Fra McCann put to Naomi Long: if the Minister is not  performing well, should we accept it?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: I  am happy to answer that and to clarify my position. It is right that the  Assembly should hold all Ministers to account. The problem is that one Minister  is being singled out by one party for party-political reasons. If the Member  wishes to look closer to home, there are a few underperforming Ministers to  deal with. The Alliance Party has said that we support the Minister&rsquo;s request  for additional funding, and we support a review of her decision; we do not  support the current position.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>:  That is magnanimous, coming from a Member from a party that does not have a  Minister. Mrs Long said that she does not come from a tradition that goes in  for sainthood. Perhaps she recognises martyrdom, because it seems that,  according to her party colleagues, the Minister is being sacrificed on the  altar of the Department for Social Development.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister talked a lot about the difficulties that she  faces &mdash; the downturn in housing sales. We have heard her mantra of &ldquo;give me the  money and I will build the houses&rdquo;, but many vulnerable people are not getting  the service that they need and deserve. The Minister seems to be somewhat  fixated with Mr McCann. I was trying to think whether they had a D H Lawrence  kind of relationship. Is it &ldquo;love-hate&rdquo; or &ldquo;hate-hate&rdquo;? The SDLP appears to be  paranoid about Mr McCann, and I am sure that he lies awake worrying about that.  Alban Maginness also appears to be paranoid about the issue, but I shall rest  our case there.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion, and I do not support the amendment. I  ask the House to support the motion. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.</p>

    <p class="Q3Motion">That the Assembly do now adjourn. &mdash;<span class="Italic"> [Mr  Deputy Speaker.]</span></p>
    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="8"></a>Adjournment</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Natural Gas: Strangford</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind Members that the proposer of the topic for the  Adjournment debate will have 15 minutes in which to speak. All other Members  who wish to speak will have approximately seven minutes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  It is a pleasure to speak in this debate. Indeed, it is a pleasure to  participate in what should be a positive debate on energy. All too often, we  have been used to energy debates that were framed by unfortunate price rises in  oil, gas or electricity. This evening, we have an opportunity to debate  something positive about energy, bringing energy choice and real economic and  environmental benefits to more people in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Members will be aware, the Strangford constituency  already has natural gas. Towns in the old Strangford constituency, such as  Carryduff and Dundonald, which will move out of the constituency, already enjoy  the benefits of natural gas. Newtownards already has natural gas, and Phoenix  Natural Gas recently had its licence extended to include Comber, which is now  also enjoying the benefits of natural gas.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I and, I am sure, my colleagues in the constituency want to  see further expansion. We consider ourselves fortunate that there is a natural  gas supplier that wants to invest in the infrastructure in our area, namely  Phoenix Natural Gas, which recently applied for a further extension of its  licence area to include Saintfield in mid-Down. Many Members will know where  Saintfield is and how it is growing. I consider Saintfield to be a strategic  staging post and a very important area in the further development of natural  gas, not just in Strangford but further afield.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In many ways, the application to extend natural gas to  Saintfield is a no-brainer for three broad reasons: the energy choice that it  will provide; the economic benefits that it will bring; and the resultant  environmental benefits. With regard to energy choice, Saintfield is typical of  many of the small rural towns in Northern Ireland in that there is  little or no real energy choice. Householders and businesses have to choose  between coal and oil for their heating, which some might say is a difficult and  unacceptable choice in this day and age. We all know about the volatility of  the price of oil and coal, and many of us will struggle to remember a time when  the price of oil went down significantly; it always seems to be on the rise.  Likewise, the price of coal has been going up. Moreover, all Members will be  mindful of the carbon-heavy nature of oil and coal and the damage that they do  to the environment. Therefore, bringing natural gas to Saintfield and elsewhere  in the Strangford constituency and beyond has created an energy choice.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are obvious economic benefits to expansion, which I  want to touch on. First and foremost, householders and businesses will benefit.  In recent days, we have seen the 19% price cut by Phoenix Natural Gas, and  Firmus Energy today announced a price cut of nearly 18%. In the case of Phoenix  Natural Gas, the decrease is on the back of a similar price decrease earlier  this year. Natural gas prices are as low as they have been for many a year,  which provides an economic benefit for householders who use it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is not just the people who live in the Saintfield area  and elsewhere in Strangford who would benefit; clearly, businesses would  benefit. I am very mindful of the economic disadvantage that a lack of energy  choice brings to our competitiveness and of the negative impact that it has on  that competitiveness. For example, for businesses in the Saintfield area that  could perhaps avail themselves of natural gas, particularly those that use a  heavy load of gas, the benefits resulting from extending the network could be  massive. Natural gas could reduce their overheads and bills significantly, and  in the current climate for some businesses that might make the difference  between keeping people in jobs and letting others go. Indeed, the savings that  could be made might allow some small businesses to expand, such would be the  impact on their bottom line if they had a wider energy choice.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The expansion of the natural gas network presents an  opportunity for the public sector. Indeed, the public sector could lead by  example in this matter. In some respects, the public sector has been leading by  example already in the area of energy. For the past number of years, natural  gas has been the fuel of choice for housing associations for newbuilds and  conversions. In areas where natural gas is accessible and money has been  available for conversions, homes have been switched to natural gas. In the  Saintfield area and further afield, if we are lucky enough at a future date,  Housing Executive stock and housing association newbuilds could be converted or  built to use natural gas. Natural gas creates obvious savings for the  householders who use it, and it is a much more efficient fuel, given that the  efficiency standard in boilers is around 95% compared with that for very  inefficient oil, Economy 7 or coal.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Natural gas is not just for housing. In the public sector,  schools could convert to natural gas, and in some areas many have done so  already. Leisure centres, community centres and clinics could convert to  natural gas and make some savings. The previous debate centred on a lack of  resources in a particular area, and that resource challenge will only increase  as the years go on. Anything that can save the public sector money is worth  examining, and extending the natural gas network would provide that opportunity  in the Strangford constituency.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Economically, there is great benefit to be had from the  infrastructural investment that would come purely from putting the pipes into  the ground. Roads have to be dug up and pipes have to be laid, and men and  women have to be employed to prepare for the digging and laying of the pipes.  It is my understanding that, if natural gas were brought to the Saintfield  area, some &pound;2&middot;6 million of infrastructural investment in the natural gas  network would be made. That is a huge amount of money, and it is certainly not  to be sniffed at in these very difficult times. I wonder how many people that  will keep in employment and how many others it will give jobs to. Money going  to local contractors to lay those pipes and to put that infrastructure in place  will obviously create a spin-off for the wider economy as workers spend their  money in shops and services in the local area.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to remember that that is &pound;2&middot;6 million of  private investment; it does not represent a begging-bowl approach, and we are  not looking for a handout from the public sector. The initial investment will  come largely from the private sector, and that is an opportunity that is not to  be sniffed at. When the pipes are laid and the infrastructure is in place,  people will want to convert to natural gas. That, in turn, will bring economic  benefit for small, local installers who make a living from converting homes,  businesses and the public sector estate to natural gas. There are a lot of  people out there who, through small jobs in converting, will do well out of any  network extension.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">From the beginning to the end of any such project,  consumers, businesses, the public sector, investors and installers will feel a  massive economic benefit as a result of that &pound;2&middot;6 million investment in the  infrastructure. Economically, an extension has great potential for this part of  the Strangford constituency.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are also well-recognised environmental benefits to  natural gas, as opposed to other carbon-heavy fossil fuels. It is a  lower-carbon fuel, and gas can certainly help Northern Ireland to make a  contribution to lowering harmful greenhouse gas emissions. It is widely  recognised that a gas-condensing boiler emits up to 50% less carbon than, for  example, an oil boiler. That is a huge difference, and, given that we are all  increasingly conscious of the damage that carbon-heavy fuels do to the  environment, we must not miss this opportunity to encourage more people, more  businesses, and more of our public sector estate to contribute to lowering  carbon emissions in Northern    Ireland.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">6.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As we look to the future of energy in Northern Ireland, we should not accept natural  gas being confined to a small area around greater Belfast  and to 10 towns along the North/South pipeline from Newry to Londonderry.  We should not take a narrow view that gas can only be viable in those places  and that everybody else should make do with the old, inefficient, carbon-heavy  fuels or some hotchpotch of micro&shy;generation renewables. We need to consider  expanding our natural gas network as far and wide as possible.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That has already happened in microcosm, in Comber, where  the licence area was extended. It can happen again in Saintfield, which, as I  said before, is a critical staging post for the expansion of the natural gas  network. From there, we can, in the future, move further north to expanding  towns, such as Ballygowan, or further south through Crossgar into big towns,  such as Downpatrick, where benefits could be immense for business, consumers  and the public sector estate. We should expand the network; this is an  important first step towards expansion into the south-east.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am heartened by the inclusion in the draft strategic  energy framework of a reference to expanding the natural gas network, not only  in the south-east of Northern    Ireland but into the west. I commend the  Minister for her efforts towards achieving that aim. She obviously has a  constituency interest in the expansion of the natural gas network in that  direction, and she is right to fight for that. There are particular benefits in  moving west, especially for business. Many big businesses in the west of Northern Ireland  would benefit immensely from the availability of natural gas.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate that technical issues need to be considered  and that the Utility Regulator needs to complete an economic appraisal of the  proposal. Every &ldquo;i&rdquo; must be dotted and every &ldquo;t&rdquo; crossed, and I expect nothing  less. Although we are debating the matter today, and the Minister is present to  reply, I appreciate that she cannot deal with the issue herself; it is a matter  for the Utility Regulator. I am happy to leave him to do his job, but I urge  and plead with him to listen to the people of Strangford when making his  assessment. He should listen to the businesses there and, most importantly, to  the views of the elected representatives of that constituency, which have been  expressed here today. He should ensure that the natural gas network extends to  Saintfield and, hopefully, with further investment in the future, beyond, so  that the energy choice and economic and environmental benefits of natural gas  reach as many people as possible in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I support this evening&rsquo;s proposal. During the first period of devolution, my  colleague Sean Neeson led the campaign to extend natural gas to the north-west  and elsewhere in Northern    Ireland. Sean and the Alliance Party  continue to support that notion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In its strategic energy framework, the Department of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment committed to encouraging a shift away from  domestic dependence on oil for home heating to natural gas. We certainly agree  with that sentiment, and I am glad that the Minister is present in the Chamber.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The natural gas industry arrived in the 1990s, and there  are now 125,000 gas customers in the greater Belfast, Larne and Lisburn licensed areas. In  greater Belfast,  the vast majority of Housing Executive homes have been connected to natural  gas. Almost all newbuild properties, nearly every large business and, I am  informed, over 60% of smaller businesses have gas as their means of energy. In  the 10 years up to and including 2008, approximately 200 new customers were  connected to the natural gas network every week right across Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Mr Hamilton said, natural gas will deliver real  enterprise and economic value to the proposed new areas. In addition to their  private shareholder natural gas investment, the wider natural gas industry is  investing in the local economy. Over &pound;500 million has been invested by all  involved in the gas industry over the past 10 years, most of which has employed  local labour to convert homes and businesses to natural gas.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Phoenix Gas estimates that rolling out the natural gas  network to new areas could add approximately 1,000 new jobs to the local  construction and service industries, which is surely good news for everyone in Northern Ireland,  particularly in these trying times. Natural gas makes Northern Ireland  more marketable to inward investors who wish to locate their businesses here.  Diversification of energy supply reduces prices for consumers: Minister Ritchie  mentioned that earlier, and we all welcome those efforts.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Along with Simon Hamilton, the Alliance Party welcomes the  Phoenix Gas planning application to extend its network throughout the  Strangford constituency and into the Saintfield area. Natural gas should be  made more available to increase energy competition, leading to a further  reduction in prices for consumers. Reducing fuel prices is a key weapon in the  fight against fuel poverty, and extending the natural gas network will have a  range of other benefits, including a reduction in greenhouse gases and the creation  of jobs in installing the required infrastructures.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We welcome the recent 19% reduction in gas prices. It is  not so long ago that we were on the opposite side of the fence, when there were  huge increases in gas prices that would have been a deterrent to conversion.  Hopefully, we are entering a new dispensation; many will say that the 19%  reduction is not before time. Let us hope that that trend continues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party looks forward to natural gas being made  more widely available to consumers in rural areas. I must mention my  constituency now: I have a particular interest in the Ards Pensinsula and  mentioned it a number of times to the gas providers. They said at the time  that, if there was sufficient demand in that area, they would consider it, but  why should the residents of the Ards Peninsula or, indeed, any other area in  the Strangford constituency be denied the choice of cheaper energy for their  homes and businesses? In the meantime, we welcome the proposals that are afoot  and support the Adjournment topic.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I support the Adjournment topic and congratulate Simon Hamilton on giving us  the opportunity to comment on it. As a representative of the Strangford  constituency, I am keen for natural gas to be installed and available for all  the people there.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not wish to sound like an advertiser for Phoenix Gas  or any other natural gas provider, nor do I want to repeat what everyone else  has said. However, having read the Phoenix Gas information booklet, I want to  take a slightly different angle and look at the benefits of natural gas for  householders.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I read an information booklet from Phoenix Gas today, and I  could not help but see the real benefits that come from using natural gas,  whether at home or in business. The sales pitch states that natural gas offers  choice and flexibility. It can be used to power central heating or single  appliances. It is not unlike electricity in that appliances can be used for  cooking, and, although I have never used a tumble dryer, those can still be  used too.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Natural gas offers choice in how to run the home. It offers  control, and that is an option that a lot of people in Strangford do not have.  Natural gas central heating is ideal for all lifestyles: for someone like me,  who comes home in the early hours of the morning, or my wife, who is at home  all day with the boys. At the touch of a button, enjoy cosy warmth and plenty  of hot water &mdash; I sound like an advert on the television &mdash; without the need for  an expensive immersion heater. There are cost savings, which we should be  encouraging.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I like an open fire, but living-flame fires look and feel  like genuine coal fires without the soot, ash, dirt and cleaning. There are  advantages for an almost single man: I am married, of course, but I am almost  like a single man in relation to my home.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A natural gas cooker can transform the way in which one  cooks, giving total control and an instant precise response from a gas hob. For  someone who used to live on Chinese takeaways before becoming diabetic, that is  of great advantage. I sound as if I am making a sales pitch, but the choice of  cookers, hobs and ranges has never been more exciting. As Members can hear, I  am enthralled by natural gas appliances.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will come to a serious point: natural gas costs less than  electricity. That is why we want to have it in Strangford. A newspaper headline  today pointed out that NIE has dropped its prices by 5%. &ldquo;Bully for NIE&rdquo; is all  I can say. The prices were dropped by 10% a while ago. Every one of us receives  an electricity bill. People regularly come to my office to tell me of their  concerns about debt and the fact that their electricity bill is two or three  times higher than it used to be. For NIE to drop prices by 5% or 10% is not  sufficient. That can be balanced against the natural gas tariffs. Phoenix Gas  has dropped its tariff by 19%. That matters. It was dropped by a significant  figure a short time ago.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Gas-powered tumble dryers do not just cut back on charges  compared with NIE, they also reduce electricity usage. That is the type of  effect that we want to see. Here is an interesting fact for those who aspire to  look after their own home &mdash; I am not sure whether I am one of those people:  running costs of a natural gas tumble dryer are half that of an electric one.  The typical annual running cost of a gas-powered tumble dryer is &pound;25&middot;20,  compared with that of an electric tumble dryer, which costs &pound;65&middot;91. There is a  clear difference.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is all about choice. My colleagues Simon Hamilton and  Kieran McCarthy have said that the people of Strangford deserve and should have  a choice. I cannot sign up for this miracle of modern life, this gas, at my  home address, because it is not available there. Nor can I do so at my work  address. I cannot get natural gas at work or at the office. That is not just  Jim Shannon talking; it is all the people in the Strangford area who live in  Newtownards and who cannot get natural gas. I cannot get the wonderful  money-saving aid in a time of economic depression to help my constituents in  the Strangford area or anywhere down the Ards Peninsula.  Some areas of Newtownards have access to natural gas, but there are a great  many other areas that do not. On the whole, it is not readily available. We  hope that gas will be available in Comber and Saintfield soon.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">6.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is long past time that our rural constituents have  access to the gas network, especially given the well-publicised downturn in gas  prices. For that reason, I join my colleague Simon Hamilton in asking the gas  company to take note of the needs of the Strangford people and take action. It  is very important that natural gas be made available to the new houses that  have been built in Strangford over the last while and that people there can  take advantage of the price reductions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Northern Ireland  has the best broadband coverage in the UK. If that can be achieved in  rural areas, then surely natural gas can be made available to everyone who  wishes to purchase it. It is long past time that our rural constituents are  afforded the same opportunities as those in the rest of the Province. It is long  past time that natural gas output was extended throughout Strangford: to the Ards Peninsula;  all of Newtonards; Comber; Saintfield; and to Crossgar and Ballynahinch, which  will soon become part of the Strangford territory. I support the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I have no doubt that Phoenix Gas will be rushing to the Ards Peninsula  in the morning to get Mr Shannon to sign a marketing contract. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  I thank Mr Hamilton for introducing the Adjournment debate on the extension of  the natural gas network in the part of County Down  that he represents. I fully support the views outlined by him and his  constituency colleagues; I will call them the Strangford three from now on.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My support is twofold. First, I always support proposals  that I consider to be of benefit to the people of County Down.  Secondly, if the desired pipeline eventually makes its way further into the  Strangford constituency, it will be just one step removed from South Down,  which is the part of the county that I represent.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If the gas pipeline is extended within the Strangford  constituency, and I sincerely hope that that it is, it would be relatively easy  to make a similar case for the residents and businesspeople of Saintfield,  Ballynahinch, Crossgar, Downpatrick, Castlewellan and Newcastle. The western part of South Down  will be serviced by a different pipeline, thus my comments relate to the area  bordering the Strangford constituency. However, I have fears regarding Kilkeel,  which, geographically, is so far removed from both pipelines that it may have  to wait for another day.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Extending the natural gas pipeline within the Strangford  constituency will enable many new customers to be served. Towns, communities  and individuals stand to benefit economically. Mr Hamilton referred to the  potential benefits that an extension of the natural gas pipeline will bring,  and I agree with him. New investment will provide valuable jobs in the gas  installation industry. Heating engineers will have a role to play, and the  private house-building sector will experience additional benefits in its field  of expertise. From a social perspective, the introduction of a mains gas supply  to family homes should improve the standard of living and leave occupants with  more disposable income.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In its document &lsquo;New Priorities in Difficult Times&rsquo;, the  SDLP proposes the establishment of a &pound;12 million investment fund in 2009-2010  to kick-start the facilitation of the maximum penetration of natural gas in  Northern Ireland. It is not enough to run spurs from the main transmissions  into adjacent towns. Distribution networks need to be rolled out to as many  towns as possible, thereby offering choice to all customers. Phoenix Gas and  Firmus Energy will require an element of public subsidy and/or sympathetic  regulations to accelerate the development of the two networks into new areas.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the request that Mr Hamilton made on behalf of  his Strangford constituents who are still without a gas supply. I have no doubt  that the Members for Strangford will support me when the time comes for the  pipeline to be extended to South Down.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment (Mrs Foster)</strong>: I am sure that we were all enthralled by Jim&rsquo;s  description of domestic chores.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  He is a domestic goddess.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: He is a domestic god rather than a domestic goddess. He spoke  about how he will do the cooking and the tumble-drying. I cannot wait, and Mrs  Shannon must be very excited by the whole prospect. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On a serious note, I congratulate Mr Hamilton for securing  the Adjournment debate. I very much welcome the opportunity to discuss this  important issue in the House today. The debate is timely because, as was  mentioned, the new strategic energy framework for Northern Ireland is out for  consultation. One of our chief goals is to improve the security and diversity  of supply. The extension of Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s gas network is a key element of  our planning in that respect.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to set out a bit of the background to the gas  industry in Northern Ireland.  Natural gas is a relatively new phenomenon here. It arrived in 1996 via the Scotland to Northern Ireland pipeline, known as  SNIP, which is the undersea gas pipeline. Initially, it was principally  intended to help to fuel electricity generation by way of a new combined cycle  gas turbine at Ballylumford.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Since then, the industry has expanded steadily. In addition  to being Northern Ireland&rsquo;s primary source of power generation, gas now brings  the cleanest burning fossil fuel to many homes and businesses throughout  greater Belfast, including, as Mr Hamilton mentioned, areas in the Strangford  constituency, as well as to other parts of the Province.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the past decade, Phoenix Natural Gas has constructed  significant networks, and it has grown its customer base in the licence areas  of greater Belfast  and Larne to approximately 125,000. That has helped to establish natural gas as  a major competitive source of fuel for the commercial and domestic energy  sectors. I do, however, accept that the company operates in a specific area of Northern Ireland,  and I will touch on that subject later.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Further development of the gas infrastructure has taken  place over the past five years, with the construction of a major gas  transmission pipeline to the north-west of Northern Ireland in 2004. That not  only supplies fuel to the electricity power station at Coolkeeragh but brings  gas to businesses and householders in the urban areas of Londonderry,  Limavady, Coleraine, Ballymoney and Ballymena.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The construction of a gas transmission link with the Republic of Ireland  through the South/North pipeline was completed in 2006 and provides security of  supply in the event of the pipeline from Scotland becoming unavailable. It  is important for Northern    Ireland not to be reliant on only one  source. That link has also led to natural gas being provided to the towns and  cities of Newry, Banbridge, Craigavon and Antrim.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Firmus Energy has approximately 5,000 customers in the  areas adjacent to the north-west and South/North pipelines. It continues to  roll out the gas infrastructure in the area for which it is licensed. That sets  the current network of gas in Northern    Ireland in context.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To turn now to Strangford, natural gas has been available  in the northern part of the constituency for some time. Phoenix Natural Gas, as  part of its original development plans for greater Belfast, has been supplying customers in  Newtownards, Dundonald and Carryduff for several years. In 2007, Phoenix applied for, and was granted from the regulator,  permission to expand its gas network in the Strangford constituency to include  Comber and a quarry on the edge of the constituency at Temple.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Members know, and as was mentioned in the debate, other  parts of the Ards   Peninsula are less  densely populated and, therefore, an economically viable gas network may not be  possible. That is the position from an economic perspective, but bear with me  and I speak more about that later.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are undertaking work to consider the potential for the  roll-out of natural gas elsewhere. That may have some direct relevance to rural  areas in the rest of the Strangford constituency and in the South Down  constituency.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am aware that the gas industry has been considering how  the roll-out of gas can be further increased. Within the past six weeks, Phoenix has applied to  extend its licence area to bring natural gas to Saintfield. The application is  with the Utility Regulator who has the main responsibility for issuing gas  conveyance and supply licences. I spoke to him only yesterday, when he told me  that he was working through the application. Work is, therefore, ongoing.  Indeed, Phoenix  has been giving thought to how the gas network might be extended to east Down  and further, to Downpatrick.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department is conscious of the need to encourage the  continued development of the gas network to those rural areas that may not be  covered. We are undertaking a number of initiatives to realise that. Along with  the Utility Regulator, we recently commissioned consultants to undertake a  study to consider the technical issues and the costs and benefits that are  associated with extending the gas network. That will involve a feasibility  study to look at the potential pipeline routes and gas loads in the towns to  the west and north-west of Northern    Ireland. That study&rsquo;s conclusions will  provide me with some information that will not only be useful to the areas that  are directly assessed but is likely to have direct relevance to other areas of  Northern Ireland for which proposals are being considered by the wider gas  industry.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have heard from the Members present that there are clear  benefits to be obtained from extending the natural gas network in Northern Ireland,  such as the diversity of fuel supply and a reduction in carbon emissions. To  that extent, we must consider the future development of the natural gas network  to help us to encourage a shift in domestic use away from oil to more efficient  use of gas. Therefore, in conjunction with the Utility Regulator and major gas  stakeholders, it is proposed to establish a gas strategic development group,  which will consider how the Northern    Ireland gas market can be further developed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, it must be stressed that, at present, the  expansion of the gas network to towns in the west, the north-west, the  Strangford constituency or anywhere else in Northern Ireland can take place  only where it is economically viable to do so. An important part of our gas  extension study, and any consideration for extending the gas network, must be  an assessment of the realisable gas loads in the respective areas. Indeed,  there are locations in the existing gas licence areas in which the take-up of  natural gas has been disappointing in some sectors. We are very keen for  businesses and domestic users to consider gas and, perhaps, dual fuel as an  option.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I thank the Minister for giving way. On the last point that she made, does she  agree that the enormous hike in the price of gas in the past year or so &mdash; I  think that there were two huge increases &mdash; is enough to put off anyone  converting to gas? Will she also ensure that the price of gas will be regulated  when the number of customers is substantial? There should be some mechanism in  place so that companies &mdash; whatever company it may be &mdash; do not have a monopoly  and are unable to charge whatever price they like to the customers who use  their supply.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: Indeed. That is why we have the Utility Regulator to deal with  those very issues. Although Members may think that I should not have to, it is  important to state that the Utility Regulator is completely independent of the  Government. He does not fall under my remit or the remit of anybody else: he is  completely independent.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Last week, I had the opportunity to meet the head of all  the European regulators. We made the point that all the regulators in Europe should be completely independent from Governments  and should also be on a level playing field. We have concerns about some  countries in that regard, but the Utility Regulator is completely independent  in Northern Ireland.  He will take into account the issues that the Member raised.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">With natural gas now established as a major fuel source for  industrial and domestic consumers in many parts of Northern Ireland, I very much  welcome Phoenix Supply&rsquo;s recent announcement that it is to reduce its gas  tariffs by 19%. Firmus Energy has brought down its price for domestic customers  by nearly 18% in its licensed area. Those announcements are extremely welcome  for their customers in what are, as many Members have said, very difficult  economic times.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, the debate is timely, given that we are  developing a new strategic energy framework. It has given me another  opportunity to underline the importance of people making known their views on  that strategic framework, and to say that I regard our energy infrastructure,  including extending our gas network, as a key element in that framework moving  forward.</p>
