    <p class="H4StageHeading">Committee for Finance and Personnel: Chairperson</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I inform Members that Ms Jennifer McCann resigned as Chairperson of the  Committee for Finance and Personnel with effect from Wednesday 19 January. The  nominating officer for Sinn F&eacute;in, Mr Pat Doherty, nominated Mr Daith&iacute; McKay as  Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and Personnel. Mr McKay accepted the  appointment. I am satisfied that the requirements of Standing Orders have been  met and, therefore, confirm Mr McKay as Chairperson of the Committee for  Finance and Personnel with effect from Wednesday 19 January.</p>
    <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="b"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">EU Fisheries Council: 13-14 December 2010</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have received notice from the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development  that she wishes to make a statement to the House.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development (Ms Gildernew)</strong>: Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat,  a Cheann Comhairle. With your permission, Mr Speaker, I wish to make a  statement about the outcome of the autumn negotiations on various fisheries  matters and, in particular, the Fisheries Council held in Brussels on 13 and 14  December 2010, which determined fishing opportunities for 2011.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Prior to the December Council, fellow Ministers and I met  and consulted our respective industries to determine the main negotiating  priorities ahead of Council. I also met Sean Connick TD, Minister for Fisheries  in the Southern Government and, at the end of November, Commissioner Damanaki,  when I was able to put directly to her my concerns about the initial Commission  proposals.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I had agreed three main priorities with our stakeholders:  to resist the proposals for separate quotas for the nephrops functional units  in area VII; to secure Commission commitment to a fundamental review of the cod  recovery plan; and to secure an increase in the herring quota. The top priority,  as it now seems to be every year, was to resist the Commission&rsquo;s proposal to  introduce spatial management arrangements for area VII nephrops and to minimise  any cut to the total allowable catch (TAC) for that species. There was strong  opposition from other member states to the Commission&rsquo;s management proposals  for nephrops. My Southern counterpart, Sean Connick TD, and I articulated that  to the Commission and presidency during the negotiations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As a consequence, the Commission withdrew those proposals  but then, disappointingly, proposed a 17% decrease in the TAC for area VII. I  told the Commission that that was grossly unfair to our fleet operating in the Irish Sea, which fully fishes its quota on stocks that  are being fished sustainably. Furthermore, a cut of that magnitude would have a  devastating impact on our processors and coastal communities, which have little  alternative economic activity and, therefore, depend on that key stock.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The unfairness of the Commission&rsquo;s proposal stems from the  way in which average landings figures for other nephrops grounds in area VII  are used to arrive at the total allowable catch. That skews the overall  assessment and unfairly penalises the member states that fully fish their  quota. For example, landings by the French fleet, mainly from grounds in the Celtic Sea,  represent less than half the French annual quota. In those circumstances, even  a cut of 17% would make no difference to the fishing patterns of the French  fleet.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The next compromise document from the presidency proposed a  cut of 12%. That was rejected, and I continued to press for a lesser cut in the  subsequent negotiations. Initially, 5% was offered. However, the Commission and  the presidency were persuaded to move further, and the final proposal voted through  was for a 3% cut. The British and North of Ireland quota now stands at 7,137  tons, most of which will be taken from the Irish Sea.  After banking surplus stock from 2010, it is expected that fishing  opportunities will be similar in 2011.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Commission will again push for further reductions next  year to bring the overall area VII total allowable catch down to maximum  sustainable yield level. I again fear that our fishing opportunities will be  affected by the prevailing circumstances in nephrops grounds outside the Irish Sea.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Commission has accepted the need to carry out a  fundamental review of cod recovery plans, and we have made it clear to the  Commission that a fresh approach needs to be taken that reflects the  circumstances of each zone rather than a simple one-size-fits-all approach.  However, as we prepare for that review, it will not be sufficient to say that  the current approach is unacceptable; we must ensure that we have viable,  alternative proposals to building depleted stocks.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will now move on to Irish Sea  herring and other pelagic stocks. In spite of very good scientific indicators  of a healthy and expanding stock, the Commission initially offered only a  rollover for Irish Sea herring. I argued that  the evidence that had been provided from the work undertaken in partnership  between the industry and scientists justified an increase, and, eventually, a  10% increase was agreed. It is normal practice for our producer organisations  to make in-year quota swaps, and, as a consequence, practically all the  available Irish Sea herring quota is fished by  local vessels landing into the County Down-based processing sector. Just before  Christmas, Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute (AFBI) scientists convened an  experts&rsquo; meeting in Belfast  to develop a draft long-term management plan for that stock. That will be  brought to the Commission in 2011, and I hope that the plan will be used to  determine the total allowable catch in future. Having a plan in place will also  mean that the industry-led Irish Pelagic Sustainability Group will be able to  make progress in getting a Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) accreditation for  the fishery, which is becoming the benchmark for a sustainable fishery and a  prerequisite for entry into many markets.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Clyde herring quota has  still to be decided. However, the Commission has introduced new arrangements  that allow member states to determine the quota if an entire stock lies within  that member state&rsquo;s waters. The western mackerel total allowable catch, which  is determined by external negotiations between the EU and other coastal states,  was reduced by 12%, with the British and North of Ireland quota dropping to  150,870 tons in 2011. The big issue on mackerel remains the unjustified quota  declarations by Iceland and  the Faroe Islands. All Ministers with an  interest in that stock had lobbied the commissioner strongly, and I welcome the  commitment that she gave at Council to taking strong action to defend the  interests on mackerel fleets in these islands.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The science indicates that Irish Sea  cod, sole, and whiting stocks remain in a poor state and received significant  cuts. The original proposed cut of 50% for cod was reduced to 25%. Some cod  quota may be obtained from Ireland  to offset that which was lost through invocation of the Hague preference  mechanism. Whiting suffered another 25% reduction, and sole was reduced by 3%.  However, the quotas for those stocks are small, and neither is overly important  to the local fleet.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The scientific advice for haddock was not as good as in  previous years. A 15% reduction was proposed, but a reduction of 8% was  negotiated. The TACs for anglerfish and plaice were rolled over for 2011.  Although the plaice stock is still very healthy, the Commission had concerns  about discards in that fishery and therefore decided not to offer an increase.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The cod recovery plan also triggered a further 25%  reduction in fishing effort measured in kilowatt days for 2011. That will have  most impact on the residual white fish sector, which will also see a further  25% cut in area VIIa cod as well as an 8% cut in VIIa haddock.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">For the nephrops fleet, it is likely that many vessels will  continue to comply with the rules on less than 5% cod catch for each trip and  will be able to catch their nephrops quota. The industry has been working with  DARD and AFBI to reduce discards, and we have demonstrated that in figures that  were put to the Commission. We will want to ensure that those positive steps  are taken account of in the review of the cod recovery plan. That review is to  take place next year, and we hope that it will have a fundamental effect on all  Irish Sea fisheries.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate the opportunity to bring Members up to date on  the outcome of the autumn fisheries negotiations so far as they affect our  fleet. I am grateful to my colleagues Richard Benyon in DEFRA, Richard Lochhead  in the Scottish Government and Sean Connick in the South of Ireland for their  strong support throughout the negotiations. I am also grateful for the support  given by the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development, Members of the  House and our local MEPs.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development (Mr Moutray)</strong>: I  thank the Minister for providing the House with an update on the outcome of the  December Fisheries Council meeting.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I must admit that I am somewhat confused as to the reasons  for yet another cut to the prawn quotas. Historically, we have been told that  it was because the scientific evidence does not tally, but we are now told that  it has to do with the way that the French are fishing in their grounds.  Irrespective of with whom or where the blame rests, this is another cut to an  industry that is already under severe pressure.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Agriculture Committee is due to meet representatives of  the industry this week. I am sure that they will not look on the Minister&rsquo;s  negotiations to reduce a 17% cut to one of 3% in the same positive light.  Rather, I am sure that they will look at it in harsh reality, which is that  this industry is being forced on to its knees by a combination of cuts, reduced  effort and the inability of the Department to provide much-needed aid through  the EFF. Does the Minister accept that, if DARD had been consistent in opposing  the European Commission&rsquo;s proposals on financial unit quotas from the outset,  the result for prawn quotas might have been even better? Furthermore, what  consultation will DARD have with the industry to prepare for the debate ahead  with the European Commission during 2011 to ensure that the overall area VII  quota is not subdivided come 2012?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister will be aware that agreement was reached for a  fundamental review of the present EU cod recovery regulation. There is industry  concern that budgetary staff cutbacks in DARD and AFBI will significantly  reduce the input that Northern Ireland  can make to that review to ensure a satisfactory and just outcome for Northern  Irish fishermen and the Irish Sea. Will the  Minister agree to maintain the current level of fisheries scientific staff in  AFBI and commit to the maintenance of the present level of DARD senior  management during what is an extremely important year for fisheries  negotiations at EU level as well as at national and devolved level?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, although the increase of 10% in the Irish Sea herring quota is welcome, it is less than what  was hoped for. We would like to know why. Will the Minister assure us that the  existing AFBI fisheries science personnel will be maintained so that, among  other issues, the long-term management plan for Irish Sea  herring can be agreed?</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a Cheann  Comhairle. First, one of the things that the Chairperson mentioned was what I think  he called &ldquo;financial management&rdquo;. However, I think that he means functional  management quotas.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The industry was opposed to functional management; however,  earlier in the year, functional management suggested a 6% cut for our industry.  Having spoken with and listened to the industry, we decided not to go down that  route because of the opposition to that suggestion. The issue of functional  unit management is complicated. The sum of the science for all functional units  in area VII in the first Commission proposal totalled 18,684 tons, which  represented a 17% decrease on the 2010 TAC. As I said, the allocation key that  was suggested by the Commission meant that the nephrops tonnage available to  our vessels would be reduced by 6% rather than 17%. Although that appeared to  offer the best prospect of maximising the quota available to us, there was  widespread opposition among member states and our industry. Therefore, I  decided to approach the negotiations with the Commission on the basis of not  supporting functional unit quotas. A number of aspects of the Commission&rsquo;s  proposals were unacceptable. For example, the reference period used to  determine the allocation keys was wrong, and there were problems with the data.  A more recent, shorter period would have produced more representative keys that  were based on more reliable data, which would have increased our share on the  TAC.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Our discussions with the Commission and officials are  ongoing. We do not leave all of that work until the end of the year; we do it  throughout the year. In fact, I recently refreshed my invitation to  Commissioner Damanaki to come and see our industry and what I was talking  about. It looks unlikely that she will be here before May, but I have asked her  to consider that invitation nonetheless, given the importance of fisheries to  our economy and the social and cultural importance of fisheries to the south  Down community.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I was disappointed to hear the Chairman rubbish the  negotiation this year. I accept that there was a cut of 3%; there is no question  about that. Nonetheless, that is a much more acceptable cut to our local fleet  than 17%. Indeed, people in the Chairman&rsquo;s party have privately congratulated  me on a very good negotiation and on reducing that percentage considerably. We  never dress up a cut as an achievement, but reducing it from 17% to 3% was a  significant difference for our fleet. It will ensure decent fishing  opportunities for the south Down fleet in 2011, so I am disappointed by the  Chairman&rsquo;s presentation this morning. I assure him and the House that the  scientists in AFBI and DARD will continue to prioritise and work towards the  future of fishing opportunities in the Irish Sea  and to maximise the opportunities available to our fishermen in all regards. It  was a wee bit disappointing to hear what the Chairman said today. I hope that  other people will recognise the not insignificant achievement in reducing that  cut from 17% to 3%.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister and her officials  for their efforts in Brussels.  As an MLA from South Down, I know that the industry and the people in the  fishing communities greatly appreciate those efforts.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In view of the recent television show about discards, will  the Minister outline what she is doing in that regard? Will she make  representations to Brussels?  People do not want to see healthy fish being dumped at sea.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat. The matter has  come up in previous fisheries debates and questions from Members. It has also  been raised with my officials by the Agriculture Committee. The recent &lsquo;Big  Fish Fight&rsquo; campaign threw some light on what is a very complex issue. There is  no doubt that the discarding of fish is an incredible waste of valuable resources  and cannot be justified. It is a concern to me, to Fisheries Ministers in other  Administrations and to the industry. There are many different reasons for  discards, but it happens mainly because of market conditions and the management  systems that are in place.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One of the areas on which the TV campaign focused was the North Sea. My Scottish colleague, Richard Lochhead, is  acutely aware of the problem and has lobbied the Commission successfully to  introduce a new quota system in the North Sea  that is based on what boats catch and not on what they land. Locally, we  continue to test new fishing gears that minimise the catch of non-target fish.  We are seeking an amendment to the technical conservation regulations to  include a specification for a net that was trialled successfully by AFBI and  the local industry. The adoption of such gear would more than halve the  discards of juvenile haddock and whiting in nephrops trawls.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Where there are successful solutions to the problem of  discarding, whether through different management arrangements or new fishing  gears, I want to see them introduced with the minimum of fuss and bureaucracy.  That is what I and others want to see: a reformed common fisheries policy that  results in a more decentralised approach to fisheries management and would  better exploit the knowledge of local fisheries managers and the local fishing  sector.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  The Minister indicated that Northern Ireland  and the UK  faced a 12% reduction in the western mackerel catch. Will she indicate what actions  are being taken by her and the EU in relation to the Faroe Islands and Iceland, which  have unilaterally increased the amount of mackerel that they intend to catch?  It is unfair that local fishermen should have to bear that burden while others  increase their quota.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I agree with the Member. Those  negotiations and discussions are taking place. Indeed, it was something that  the Commission was very focused on throughout the autumn, when a number of  high-level meetings took place, for example, between the EU and political  representatives from the Faroe Islands and Iceland. It is totally  unjustifiable that the Faroese and Icelandic communities just decided on a  figure for their mackerel catch this year, thereby reducing significantly the  amount of effort available in the North Sea.  Although many of our local fleet do not travel as far as the North   Sea, those actions will impact on the overall amount of mackerel  available for the industry on these islands to catch, so it is of great concern  to us all. Those discussions are ongoing. However, I accept fully what the  Member said: it was absolutely unjustified and unfair to the local sector.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her statement. Given the crucial importance of fishing  to the economies of Ardglass and Kilkeel in south Down, will the Minister  provide details of discussions that have taken place on alternative proposals  to the cod recovery plan? Furthermore, given that the Minister recognises the  need for a more decentralised approach to the common fisheries policy, will she  give us details of any negotiations that have taken place and of when that  regionalisation will actually take place, so that we will have control over our  own fishing industry?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: That day is not with us yet. The common  fisheries policy is under review, and, at this point, we do not have a more  decentralised approach. That is what I am working towards, but it is not here  yet, and people need to be realistic about that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Commission initially proposed a 50% cut in the cod  quota, which would have resulted in a by-catch allowance for prawn vessels of a  little over 1% of the prawn catch. Although our nephrops vessels land very  little cod, cutting the quota by 50% would not lead to reduced cod mortality;  it would simply lead to an increase in discards of marketable cod. Therefore, I  believe that the move by the Commission to reduce the quota by 50% is ill  conceived. However, I agree that we must take effective action to rebuild cod  stocks. Therefore, I pressed the Commission to have a comprehensive review of  the cod recovery plan, which will happen next year.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I remind the House that we opposed the cod recovery plan  when other member states thought that it would be a good thing to do. We said  that we would not go down that route and did not agree with it. Indeed, two  years ago, in the autumn 2008 negotiations, we took a very firm stance on the  matter. Now that we have achieved a fundamental review of the cod recovery  plan, we need to put forward serious alternative proposals. It will not wash  for us just to tell the EU Commission that we do not like it and then to sit  back and leave it up to them. We have to come up with serious alternative proposals.  I have worked consistently with the House, the Agriculture Committee and the  industry to find the best way forward for our fleet, and that is how we will  take the matter forward. The cod recovery review needs to look at the impact on  other fleets and at technical conservation, such as closed areas and recovery  targets. Therefore, it needs to be wide-ranging and needs to be a solution that  fits the needs of our industry.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement to the House this morning. I will talk about  the fishing industry as a whole, not only that in south Down. Portavogie is in  north Down; I want to plug that area. The Minister&rsquo;s statement outlined that  she has three main priorities. Is she disappointed or content with what she  came back with in relation to those three priorities? Furthermore, later in the  statement, she said:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;After banking surplus stock from 2010 it is expected  that fishing opportunities will be similar in 2011.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Given that, will any grant aid or assistance be  available to fishermen? Although the opportunities will be the same as last  year&rsquo;s, fuel prices, inflation and a lot more expenses will be added on, and  those people will be expected to make a living. Can the Department do anything  to assist along the way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: The Member asked whether I am  disappointed. We can never be 100% happy when we come back with a cut, albeit a  small one of 3% this year. However, had we come back with a figure of 17% or  close to that, I would not just have been disappointed &mdash; I would have been  devastated, knowing the impact that that would have not just on our fishers but  on our processors and on the wider economic community of south and north Down.  Therefore, I am not anywhere near as disappointed as I might have been. I  accept that a 3% cut is a cut, but the industry recognises that, given the  difficulty of this year&rsquo;s negotiation, it was a significant achievement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The other two priorities were to secure commitment to our  fundamental review of the cod recovery plan &mdash; we achieved that &mdash; and to secure  an increase in the herring quota. Again, we achieved that. We would have liked  a 15% increase, but we got an 8% increase. However, by and large, our three  priorities have been achieved. Therefore, we have to recognise, as I have said  in the House before, that there is an ongoing negotiation. We do not just go  with a wish list and get everything we want. However, this year, I, my  officials and the team that went to Brussels  worked hard to achieve what we did in November.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member asked about further support for the industry.  There is a provision in the EFF to enable key priorities to be supported,  including a decommissioning scheme, provided that we can develop a satisfactory  scheme that clearly represents value for money. There is some concern about  that. The Member pointed to the high cost of fuel. He will be aware that  fishermen get a subsidised rate on fuel, and, although, some time ago, the  Executive agreed a hardship fund for the fishing sector, I imagine that a  scheme of that nature will be unlikely in this difficult fiscal climate.  However, I am always an optimist, and, if we can find any help for the  industry, we will do our best to get it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will provide more detail on the European Fisheries Fund.  Five measures are currently open to our fishing industry: collective actions;  investments in processing and marketing; ports, landing sites and shelters;  productive investments in aquaculture and investment on board fishing vessels;  and selectivity measures. Therefore, our fleet can access quite a few measures  in the EFF already.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>:  Does the Minister appreciate the difficulty that many of us have in explaining  the science argument in layperson&rsquo;s language to fishing communities in  Portavogie and throughout Strangford? We told them to check the science, and,  if the stock is healthy, it can be fished. People can appreciate that, if it is  unhealthy, it can be looked at. In her statement, the Minister said that there  is evidence that stocks are being fished sustainably, and yet we face a cut.  Moreover, later, she said that, if stocks are not healthy, they face a cut as  well. Therefore, it is hard for people to understand the science argument.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member should come to his question.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>:  Will the Minister give us a long-term commitment on what she will do over the  next year to prevent the same thing happening again?</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: We continue to work on ensuring that we  are not faced with that situation. To put it as simply as I can: area vii means  all of area VII. It is fished, not only by us, but by France and Spain, to name two other member  states. France,  for example, does not catch around half its quota, so, when the Commission  proposes a decrease in area VII, the member states that do not fish their quota  can absorb that decrease without any kind of difficulty.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, our fleet fishes area VII sustainably and catches  all its quota. A one-size-fits-all approach is taken when we should be drilling  down into the nub of the situation. The functional management unit approach was  the Commission&rsquo;s answer to that. It divided it up, and its proposals would have  resulted in a 6% reduction, rather than a 17% reduction. We examined the merits  of that, because it seemed to be doing some of the things that we wanted to do,  bearing in mind that the reference period was not what we wanted and the data  that it was using were not what we would have gone for.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We felt that there was some merit to exploring that  proposal, but our industry was absolutely, fundamentally and vehemently opposed  to functional management units, and that is why we decided to take the other  approach. This was my fourth fisheries negotiation, and we have been consistent  in working with the industry, not only the fishing sector, but the processing  sector, and we have represented what it has said to us. That is how we got to that  point. The quota is set for all of area VII, not just the Irish   Sea, and the stocks elsewhere are not in as good a shape as in our  part of area VII, which is why a cut was proposed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I accept that it is complicated, and it is difficult to get  it across in layman&rsquo;s terms. We faced a cut of 17% and achieved a negotiation  that brought that down to 3%. That negotiation took us right through the night.  We had a meeting with the industry at around 7.00 am or a bit earlier, and we  worked hard to keep pressing the presidency and the Commission to bring that  figure back further. I am pleased because 3% is probably better than I could  have hoped for, given the circumstances of the negotiations this year.  Notwithstanding the recognition that it is a cut, the 14% that was saved will  make a difference of thousands of pounds to our fishing industry.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her statement. The Minister partly answered my question,  but I think that there is a bit missing. What research and development  assistance is being taken to reduce the discard so that young fish are not  destroyed inadvertently as fishermen strive to catch the quota that they are  allowed? It is not so long ago that all those discards were brought ashore and  manufactured into fish-meal. Now, it seems that the discard is dumped into the  sea. If an ordinary person were caught dumping, their licence would be taken  from them. There is an opportunity, but an end product cannot be achieved from  what is happening.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: As I said earlier, we continue to test  new fishing gears that minimise the catch of non-target fish, so, for example,  fishermen who are looking for nephrops can avoid catching cod or whiting. We  are seeking an amendment to the technical conservation regulation to enable us  to adopt a net that will successfully allow juvenile fish to escape and to go  on to reproduce, which will ensure a sustainable fishery for generations to  come. AFBI scientists are in the lead on that work, which is ongoing in  conjunction with the industry. It is those kinds of practical trials that get  us to the point where we have gears that do what they are supposed to do, which  is to catch the fish that they are looking for and avoid the rest.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her detailed statement. I could probably ask 15  questions about the statement, but two will do for today. I assume that the  reference to the science in paragraph 15 refers to the findings of EU  scientists. Does the Minister accept those figures? If not, will she take up  whatever facilities are available to challenge them? I think that they have to  be challenged every time that they are presented as evidence for cuts. My  second question relates to discards. Is reference ever made to the tonnage or  monetary value of the discards that our trawlermen are forced to dump?</p>
    <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Molloy] in the Chair)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: The Member asked about the figure and  where it came from. AFBI scientists work in conjunction with organisations such  as the Marine Institute in Galway and with EU  scientists in the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries  (STECF) and the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES).  Those organisations should be well known to the Member given his time on the  Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development. The figure needs to be  challenged, and I understand that the Member accused me of plucking the figure  of 17% out of the air to make it look better when I came back to make this  statement. That naivety and ignorance beggars belief, given the amount of time  that the Member has spent on the Agriculture Committee. His lack of knowledge  on this issue is very surprising to say the least. The figures are there. They  are in the public domain if he wants to check them. We continue to argue their  validity, given that all of area VII is not in as healthy a state. If he wants  a reference point, I can point him to the Porcupine bank, where the state of  the stock is not as good as it is in the Irish Sea.  Therefore, the reduction is to the whole area and not to the part that we fish.  If the Member needs me to have an A, B, C discussion on the issue, I can do  that, and I am sure that my officials will be happy to do that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In response to his second question, our fishermen discard  very little fish that are of marketable value. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a  LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>

    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Members will have a copy of the Marshalled List of amendments  detailing the order for consideration. The amendments have been grouped for  debate in my provisional grouping of amendments selected list.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are two groups of amendments, and we will debate the  amendments in each group in turn. The first debate will be on amendment Nos 1  to 7, which deal with the criteria that the Department must have regard to in  securing provision of a public passenger transport service and issuing permits  to operators of that service. The second debate will be on amendment Nos 8 to  12, relating to the power granted to the Department by the Bill and a minor  technical amendment that ensures that the Bill is within the competence of the  Assembly, together with opposition to clause 45.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Once the debate on each group has been completed, any  further amendments in the group will be moved formally as we go through the  Bill, and the Question on each will be put without further debate.

    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Deputy Speaker, before I begin speaking to this first  group of amendments, with your indulgence, I will take the opportunity to thank  the Deputy Chairperson, Miss McIlveen, and the members of the Committee, as well  as Mr Trevor Lunn, Mr Danny Kinahan and Mr Willie Clarke, who were members of  the Committee during the Committee Stage of the Bill, for all their hard work  and contributions to the scrutiny of the Bill. In addition, I recognise the  Committee Office team and the Bill Office for the support that they provided to  the Committee. Thanks are due also to the many stakeholder organisations from  the public transport sector for their written and oral evidence during our  pre-legislative scrutiny as well as during Committee Stage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Stakeholder input played a key role in the Bill&rsquo;s  development. It was also a driving force in the development of the amendments  that are before the House, which I believe will make the Transport Bill better  and will improve public passenger transport services in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Minister, the Bill team and officials from the  Department for Regional Development for their co-operative approach during  Committee Stage. Members may have noticed that the amendments have been signed  by me, on behalf of the Committee, and by the Minister. That is something of a  new departure, and it reflects the fact that they are agreed amendments, which  are designed to improve the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Supporting and improving public transport for everyone in Northern Ireland  has been a priority for the Committee for Regional Development. I want to  highlight to the House and beyond that that was the main focus of the Committee  Stage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Committees have been working hard to scrutinise and to  improve legislation that is brought forward by Departments. That work is  reflected in the debates on and amendments to the many Bills that are passing  through the House during the current mandate. I believe firmly that one of the  Assembly&rsquo;s most important functions is to make the best legislation that it  can. Although I hesitate to say it, doing so illustrates that we do more than  slug it out across the Committee table.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will move on to address the first group of amendments. I  will confine my remarks to the nature of and reasons for those amendments. That  is to allow other Committee members the opportunity to draw on the large and  detailed body of evidence in the Committee&rsquo;s report, should they wish. I will  return to the details of the Committee&rsquo;s scrutiny of the Bill&rsquo;s 50 clauses and  two schedules, and its recommendations that are not related directly to the  amendments, during the Final Stage debate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment Nos 1 to 7 belong to the first group of  amendments, which deals with providing and operating a public passenger  transport service. Amendment Nos 1, 2 and 3 are to clause 1. They aim to ensure  that the Department, in securing the provision of public passenger transport  services, has due regard to sustainability and accessibility as well as to  economy, efficiency and safety of operation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee has a keen interest in ensuring that all  aspects of the public transport system in Northern Ireland are accessible. It  heard evidence from the Inclusive Mobility and Transport Advisory Committee  (IMTAC) that accessibility should be included in the list of factors to which  the Department must pay due regard when securing public passenger transport  services.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee recognised existing disability discrimination  legislation, the Department&rsquo;s accessible transport strategy and action plan,  and the progress that it has made to ensure that transport is accessible in  Northern Ireland. However, the Committee was firmly of the view that to include  a requirement on the Department to have due regard to accessibility when  securing public passenger transport provision in Northern Ireland would bring  consideration of accessibility firmly into the mainstream of public passenger  transport planning, as well as all aspects of service delivery in Northern  Ireland. For those reasons, the Committee proposed amendment No 1.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To reflect the Committee&rsquo;s long-standing interest in and  support for sustainable transport in Northern Ireland, it brought  forward amendment Nos 2 and 3, which aim to include reference to sustainability  in clause 1(1). In proposing those amendments, the Committee is of the view  that sustainability should be defined in terms of environmental, social and  economic sustainability.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members recognised that section 25 of the Northern Ireland  (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006 provides:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;A public authority must, in exercising its functions,  act in the way it considers best calculated to contribute to the achievement of  sustainable development in Northern    Ireland&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Having considered those provisions, the Committee  was not satisfied that reliance on existing legislation was adequate in this  case. Members were aware that the current sustainable development strategy had  been reviewed and that a new strategy had yet to be put in place.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On many occasions since 2007, Committee members have  highlighted concerns that there is no specific target in the public service  agreement in the Programme for Government that relates to the development of  sustainable transport for Northern    Ireland or to address transport-related  carbon emissions.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department identifies transport-related carbon  emissions as a serious, growing problem for Northern Ireland. The Committee  acknowledged that the Department has responded to its concerns on that matter  by, for example, publishing a baseline report on transport-related carbon  emissions, the emphasis placed on sustainability in the work to revise the  regional development strategy and the early development work on the review of  the regional transportation strategy. Building on that progress, the Committee  is seeking to amend clause 1(1) to bring consideration of sustainability into  the heart of all decision-making on public passenger transport by the  Department, by requiring that due regard be taken of sustainability when the  Department is securing public passenger transport services.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased to say that amendment Nos 1, 2 and 3 have been  agreed by the Department and co-signed by the Minister, as have all the  amendments that are before the House today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I sincerely hope that the progress achieved in the past few  years in creating accessible and sustainable transport for Northern Ireland  is not reversed as a result of the swingeing cuts that we face in the draft  Budget.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment Nos 4 and 5 are proposed to clause 6. They aim to  ensure that when making decisions in relation to permits, the Department will  have regard to representations from community transport providers, as well as  to those listed at clause 6(2).</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee heard evidence on clause 6 from a number of  organisations. Clause 6 is one of a number of clauses in Part I of the Bill  that deal with the arrangements for service permits. Clause 6(2) deals with the  issue of service permits to mainly private operators, not the majority of  public passenger transport services, which will be secured by the Department  through service agreements.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 1(3) provides that the Department must ensure that  most public passenger transport services must be provided by the Northern  Ireland Transport Holding Company (NITHCo) and its subsidiaries. The Committee  heard from the Department that there are no plans to privatise NITHCo or its  subsidiaries Ulsterbus, Citybus and Northern Ireland Railways. Any future  proposals to do so would require further legislation in the House, and the  Department would be required to consult on that legislation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Services offered under the permit scheme will be additional  to the contracted network of public passenger transport services where operators  have identified a gap in the market and are prepared to offer services at their  own risk. In applying for a permit, the operator will be asked to provide  evidence of demand. Such evidence could include passenger/customer surveys;  letters of support from local residents, community groups or businesses;  customer requests; or a change to the demographics in the area.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee recognised that the proposed permit scheme  was designed to allow for innovation and the development of services to meet  local need. Following representation from the Community Transport Association,  the Committee and the Department agreed an amendment to the Bill to reflect the  role of community transport providers in meeting local transport need by  including community transport providers in the list of bodies at clause 6(2),  representations from whom the Department shall take into account when making  decisions in relation to permits.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee and the Department have agreed amendments Nos  4 and 5, and, as Chairperson, I have co-signed both amendments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee brought forward amendment No 6 to ensure that  convictions for offences under the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 would be  grounds for revocation, suspension or curtailment of a permit. That amendment  is to clause 10. Concern was expressed by the Northern Ireland Committee, Irish  Congress of Trade Unions (NICICTU) in evidence to the Committee that the Bill  should provide protection for workers in relation to the payment of the minimum  wage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department provided clarification to the Committee on  the requirements in relation to demonstrating good repute that are placed on  the holders of a bus operator&rsquo;s licence. The Committee recognised that a bus  operator&rsquo;s licence is required in order to hold a service permit. The Committee  is also aware that the enforcement of the national minimum wage is a matter for  Revenue and Customs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, following consideration of all the information  received and having explored a number of options with the Department, the  Committee recommended that the Bill be amended to reflect the its strong view  that the holding of a service permit should be jeopardised by failure to pay  the national minimum wage. Amendment No 6 was agreed with the Department and  has been signed by the Minister.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The last amendment in this group is amendment No 7. The  Committee is bringing forward the amendment to ensure that a period of notice,  as well as an inquiry and appeals mechanism, will be available to permit  holders in cases where it is decided that it is in the public interest to bring  an existing service into the network. That amendment is to clause 12.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In response to a query raised by the Federation of  Passenger Transport (FPT), the Committee noted that the clauses on permits,  specifically clause 12, provide a notice period and an appeals and inquiry  mechanism in cases where permits are to be revoked or varied by the Department.  However, it does not include cases where the Department decides that a route  operating under a permit will not be renewed and should be brought into the  network in the public interest and potentially given to Translink or tendered.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee was concerned that that could be seen as the  Department, through the proposed public transport agency, using its  monopolistic power as policymaker, network designer and owner of the Northern  Ireland Transport Holding Company subsidiary, Translink, to the potential  disadvantage of small local transport operators. Therefore, the Committee  decided that an amendment was required to allow for a minimum period of notice  and for the establishment of an inquiry and appeals mechanism. Once again, the  Department has agreed and the Minister has co-signed the amendment. That  concludes my remarks on the amendments in this group.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  I welcome the Bill and the inclusion of the terms &ldquo;accessibility&rdquo; and  &ldquo;sustainability&rdquo;. Much money has been invested in the provision of rolling  stock and low-floor buses in recent years. Those are essential for anyone who  has to use a wheelchair or has impaired mobility. My understanding is that the  inclusion of the amendments will ensure that that provision will continue, and  I warmly welcome that. I would also like to see how that will apply to private  sector transport providers other than Translink in the future. The provision of  easily accessible, sustainable vehicles and rolling stock has been a boost to  many passengers, and we as an Assembly must ensure that that provision  continues.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Leonard</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I would like to refer to this  group of amendments and to echo the comments made about the co-operation  between the Committee and the Department, its officials and the Minister. For  the group of amendments to be signed by both, as outlined, definitely shows the  ability and desire to work together to arrive at well-worked-out conclusions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">By benchmarking accessibility and sustainability in the  Bill, we can now measure things against that legal provision. Of course, that  measuring exercise will take place as a result of the Bill and will, obviously,  be done in the context of the unfolding economic situation. We can always  desire the greater accessibility and sustainability of a public transport  system, but, in a downturn, those things have to be measured against the harsh  reality of the chequebook. Nonetheless, it was worthwhile to push for the  inclusion of those terms and for the Committee to debate those issues and go  forward with them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It was vital that the importance of the community transport  sector was accepted, recognised and addressed through amendment Nos 4 and 5.  There are many areas around the North that will realise, accept and readily  refer to the importance of that sector.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The permit scheme will have to cover areas that are  somewhat more isolated and not as accessible as others. As the permit scheme is  rolled out, we will be looking for a transport facility that will serve more  isolated communities better than has been the case. It is taken for granted  that important regulations will follow the scheme, but the core provision in  the Bill is a step forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I reflect the Chairperson&rsquo;s remarks that there was a strong  feeling in the Committee about including a provision that recognised the  importance of the minimum wage and that would ensure that people in the sector  would not be exploited. It was good to see the Committee refer to that  unanimously. Work was done to find out how best we could reflect that in  legalese in the Bill, and we feel that that has been achieved. Although  different organisations have overall responsibility for the minimum wage and  there is different legislation, we made recognition of the importance of the  minimum wage integral to the Transport Bill so as to make sure that there is no  abuse of the workforce.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to refer to amendment No 7, which would amend clause  12. To be fair to permit holders and operators, there could have been a  situation whereby a route that was made workable, worthwhile to the community  and profitable was then cherry-picked. Without the amendment, that would have  been unfair to new operators. The balance between the Department and operators  will now be recognised. So, we feel that that amendment is a good addition to  the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I join the Chairperson in thanking colleagues for the way in which they worked  through the Bill. The Committee took ownership of the Bill and was quick to  identify gaps in it. It is only proper, therefore, that I also echo Mr  Leonard&rsquo;s remarks that, when those gaps were identified, the Bill team in the  Department, working alongside our own professional Committee team, was more  than happy to co-operate and work in a spirit of partnership to try to close  them. I congratulate the Minister for being willing and able to co-sign the  amendments with the Chairperson. That sends a positive sign to the House about  intent and about the seriousness of some of the deficiencies in the Bill that  need to be addressed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to confine my remarks to two themes. The first is  the amendments to include the words &ldquo;accessibility&rdquo; and &ldquo;sustainability&rdquo; in  clause 1. When the Bill arrived at Committee many of us felt that a Bill that  was meant to set the pace and tone for public transport in this region over the  next decade should also acknowledge two of the key challenges and contexts  within which public transport will have to operate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One is an acknowledgement that there are, tragically, a  growing number among us who find it difficult to access public transport  because of a physical or mental impairment or other issues. There is also a  much greater challenge that is growing by the day and refusing to go away: the  challenge of sustainability. We will all have to factor that into the planning  of government services, and in no area more so than transport services.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">So, I very much welcome the fact that the Bill will now  ensure that the Department has to pay due regard to accessibility and  sustainability when it plans public transport. We could have a bigger debate  about whether that should be a statutory duty, an even more powerful and  stronger duty, but we are where we are.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The second area that I would like to reflect on &mdash; ensuring  that workers&rsquo; rights are not affected &mdash; was commented on by Mr Leonard, the  Chairperson and, I believe, Mr Robinson. We are in a period of great change.  The budget that the Minister will have to steer through the Department is one  that none of us would want to have to steer through a Department. We will  advocate that budget being improved, but we must ensure that, if we are  legislating, as we are seeking to do in clause 12, we do not leave any back  doors or grey areas that private providers may see as an opportunity to operate  in a way that all of us find unacceptable. It is for that reason that we are  all happy to see an effective commitment to ensure that providers must pay the  minimum wage to their staff. The Department and the new agency that will be  established under the Bill will have the ability to pursue providers that fail  to do so.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">1.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will make some further observations in the debate on the  second group of amendments, but that is my contribution for now.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: I am  the newest member of the Committee. When I joined, the Bill was at the end of  its Committee Stage. However, I have been very impressed by the co-operation  between my colleagues on the Committee and the Minister in bringing forward  some amendments to strengthen the Bill. I will comment only briefly on the  Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the first group of amendments, particularly  amendments Nos 1, 2 and 3, which will ensure that there is inclusion of  accessibility and sustainability in the Bill. Accessibility is a key issue for  many people in our society. Without it, many people would not be able to get  themselves around and might find themselves isolated and excluded.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Equality is also an issue. People with disabilities should  not be prevented from going about their daily lives and using public transport  to do that. Therefore, regard to equality should be included in legislation to  ensure that it is a major consideration for the Department when it is securing  public transport services.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Increasing carbon emissions and their effect on the  environment are clearly growing problems in Northern Ireland. Therefore,  sustainability should be a high priority when decisions are being made about  public transport. I welcome the inclusion of environmental, social and economic  sustainability, alongside accessibility, as mainstream considerations for the  Department in all decisions that affect public passenger transport services and  public transport planning.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way. I have listened to what has been said, and I  am not a member of the Committee. I received a letter from Down Community  Transport, telling me that the vulnerable &mdash; those who are isolated and those  who have a disability &mdash; will receive a reduced service this year, which means  that 50% of the people who live in rural areas or have a disability will not  have transport. Does she agree that that makes what has been said in the debate  a contradiction in terms? Is the Member trying to tell me that the Bill is  going through to achieve that?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: I  thank my colleague for his intervention. The draft Budget does not bode well  for public transport over the next four years.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am disappointed that the issues of need and affordability,  which are key factors, have not been included in any amendments. I understand  that that was well discussed during Committee Stage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Assessment of services on the basis of just cost,  efficiency or effectiveness may result in need not being covered or considered.  That may be an important issue, particularly in rural areas. Just because it is  uneconomic to run, surely a public service cannot just be scrapped with no  thought about whether it is a vital service for many people.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Affordability is also a major concern for many public  transport users. Prices may mean that many people are unable to continue using  public transport.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">If prices continue to rise, our PSA targets will  not be met. The high cost of public transport would also force many people into  private vehicles and thus have a negative effect on our carbon emissions and  the environment.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development (Mr Murphy)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann  Comhairle. The amendments in group one arose from detailed discussions with the  Committee for Regional Development, resulting in a number of recommendations  from the Committee following its consideration of oral and written evidence  received during Committee Stage. I want to thank the members of the Committee  for their very helpful recommendations, detailed scrutiny and timely  consideration of the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment Nos 1, 2 and 3 relate to the inclusion of  accessibility and sustainability as additional matters to which the Department  must have regard when carrying out its duty to secure the provision of public  passenger transport services. The amendments will ensure that accessibility and  sustainability will be considered alongside economy, efficiency and safety of  operation as factors in the decision-making process for securing the provision  of public passenger transport duties. The amendments reflect the aim of the  public transport reforms to create an efficient, effective and sustainable  public transport system that contributes to the Executive&rsquo;s transportation,  environmental, social inclusion and equality objectives while supporting the  development of the wider economy. I welcome that recommendation, and the  Chairperson of the Committee and I jointly tabled an amendment to clause 1(1)  to include accessibility and sustainability as matters to which the Department  must have regard.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment Nos 4 and 5 arose as a result of my Department&rsquo;s  consideration of the written submission received from the Community Transport  Association in response to the Committee&rsquo;s call for evidence on the Bill. The  amendments relate to the consideration of applications for service permits.  Clause 6(2) as drafted requires the Department to take into account  recommendations made by the Consumer Council and representations made by  persons already providing public passenger transport services on any road along  or near the routes that are the subject of such applications, the Chief  Constable, district councils, Departments and the Northern Ireland Tourist  Board.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A number of community transport services funded by my Department  operate under a permit issued by the Department of the Environment under  section 10B of the Transport Act 1967. Although such services are not public  passenger transport services for the purposes of the Bill, I accept that those  services may be affected by the issuing of service permits for public passenger  transport. That being the case, I am of the view that providers of such  services should have the opportunity to make representations to the Department  on the service permit applications. The Department, therefore, proposes an  amendment to clause 6(2) to include representations made by the persons  providing services that receive grants from my Department under clause 33 for  the provision of services for the benefit of certain sections of the public.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 6, which would ensure compliance with the  National Minimum Wage Act 1998, has been initiated by the Committee for  Regional Development, having taken account of the oral and written evidence  received from the Northern Ireland Committee, Irish Congress of Trade Unions  (NICICTU) during Committee Stage. The Committee was keen to address the  concerns of NICICTU in relation to national minimum wage compliance by those  who provide public passenger transport services. Therefore, I support the amendment  to clause 10(1) to include conviction of an offence under the National Minimum  Wage Act 1998 as a cause for revocation, suspension or curtailment of a service  permit.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 7 was the result of the Committee&rsquo;s  consideration of written evidence from the Federation of Passenger Transport.  Again, I thank the Chairperson and the Committee for their helpful suggestion,  and I am happy to support the amendment. It provides for the inclusion of a  notice period and an inquiry in circumstances in which a permit is not to be  renewed for the reason that the Department considers that it would be in the  public interest for the service to become part of the contracted network of  public passenger transport services. The inclusion of a notice period and an  inquiry mechanism provides assurance for operators that they will be given  adequate notice and the opportunity to request an inquiry by the Department  before a final decision is taken in the public interest to include a previously  permitted route in a contracted network.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members made points about the Bill&rsquo;s clauses and the  proposed amendments, which I welcome and am happy to agree with. Mr McCarthy  made a point that strays into the Department&rsquo;s budget considerations, but,  nonetheless, I believe that it is important to respond briefly. Of course, the  budgets for transport and other responsibilities across the Department are  being seriously challenged, but Mr McCarthy will know that we have supported  rural community transport well. Many rural transport providers have extended  themselves beyond the original scope of their remit and have moved into other  areas of service to the community, which is fine when budgets can support that.  We ask that it should not impact on the services to the most vulnerable and  needy but should return to the core services for which those community  transport sectors were set up and focus on the core provision for those most  isolated, vulnerable and in need. Perhaps they will look again at some of the  extensions of the services in which they have become involved over the years.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I was coming to a conclusion, Mr Deputy Speaker, but  I am happy to give way.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Regional Development (Miss McIlveen)</strong>: I  thank Members for their comments during the debate. I add my thanks to the many  stakeholder organisations that generously gave their time and expertise to the  Committee during Committee Stage; to the Department and the Minister for facilitating  and supporting the Committee&rsquo;s amendments; and to the Committee team for its  work in producing the Bill report. The tone of the debate was very agreeable on  the whole, and that echoes the manner in which the Bill was discussed in  Committee. It was approached in a businesslike manner.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment Nos 1, 2 and 3 to clause 1 were proposed by the  Committee to ensure that the Department had due regard to sustainability and  accessibility, as well as to</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;economy, efficiency and safety of operation&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">when securing the provision of public passenger  transport services. I welcome support from Members and the Minister for those  amendments. Mr George Robinson highlighted the importance of provisions on  accessibility. We had welcome support for the amendments. I note the comments  that financial constraints have been identified as an issue, but we remain  convinced that there is a need to include sustainability, as well as  accessibility, and give it due regard, with economy and efficiency, in  passenger transport services.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment Nos 4 and 5 are to clause 6, and the Department  and the Committee support those amendments so that the important role played by  community transport providers is recognised and their views taken into account  when the Department is making decisions to award service permits. It is good to  hear such strong support from colleagues on those amendments, and they reflect  the importance of the role of community transport providers, particularly in  rural and very isolated and marginalised communities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 6 is to clause 10, and the Committee  recommended it to ensure that conviction for offences under the National  Minimum Wage Act 1998 would be made grounds for revocation, suspension or  curtailment of a permit. Again, I am glad to see that we have unanimous support  for those provisions in relation to that aspect of our work.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 7 is to clause 12, and it was proposed by the  Committee so that a period of notice and an inquiry mechanism would be  available to permit holders in cases where it is decided that it is in the  public interest to bring an existing service, operating under permit, into the  network. If we are to prioritise growing the economy and moving forward, it is  important that the context in which private operators work provides them with a  framework that supports innovation. I am pleased to hear support for that  amendment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to Ms Lo&rsquo;s comments on need, I can say that the  Committee considered the matter at length. Clauses 33 and 34 provide that the  Department can pay grants for services in certain areas and support services  for the benefit of certain sections of the public. Clause 36 allows the  Department to pay grants where there is no explicit power to do so in other  parts of the Bill. That should include groups in rural areas, older people and  people with disabilities. Although it does not perfectly cover everyone in  need, it includes the major groups.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank Members again for their interesting and valuable  contributions to today&rsquo;s debate, and I thank them for their support. I urge the  House to support the amendments before us, which the Committee believes will  make the Transport Bill better.</p>

    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: We come to the second group of amendments for debate. With  amendment No 8, it will be convenient to debate amendment Nos 9, 10, 11 and 12,  together with the Committee&rsquo;s opposition to clause 45. The amendments relate to  the power granted to the Department by the Bill and include a minor technical  amendment that ensures that the Bill is within the competence of the Assembly.  Members will note that amendment No 10 is a paving amendment for amendment No  11.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I beg to move amendment No 8: In page 8, line 4,  leave out subsection (4).</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The following amendments stood on the Marshalled  List:</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">No 9: In clause 46, page 20, line 24, leave out  &ldquo;Regulations&rdquo; and insert</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;No regulations to which this subsection applies shall  be made unless a draft of the regulations has been laid before, and approved by  resolution of, the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">(3A) Subsection (3) applies to regulations under this  Act if they include&mdash;</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">(a) regulations under section 42(3) or 43(2); or</p>

    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">(3B) Any other regulations&rdquo;. &mdash; [The Minister for  Regional Development (Mr Murphy).]</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">No 10: In clause 47, page 20, line 37, after &ldquo;means&rdquo; insert  &ldquo;&mdash;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">(a)&rdquo;. &mdash;<span class="Italic"> [The Minister for Regional  Development (Mr Murphy).]</span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">No 11: In clause 47, page 20, line 38, at end insert</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;or</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">(b) an examiner appointed by the Department of the  Environment under Article 74 of the 1995 Order;&rdquo;. &mdash; [The Minister for Regional  Development (Mr Murphy).]</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">No 12: In clause 49, page 22, line 9, leave out &ldquo;, 45&rdquo;. &mdash;  [The Chairperson of the Committee for Regional Development (Mr Cobain).]</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: Amendment No 8 was tabled as a result of the Attorney  General&rsquo;s consideration of the Bill. It would remove subsection (12)(4), which  imposes a time limit on decisions made by the Upper Tribunal. The Attorney  General was concerned that including such a time limit could impose an  obligation on other jurisdictions of the Upper Tribunal. That would fall  outside the Assembly&rsquo;s legislative competence. In light of the Attorney  General&rsquo;s comments, I tabled an amendment to remove subsection (12)(4).</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The opposition to clause 45 stand part was debated during  Committee Stage. The Committee indicated that it was not in favour of the  clause&rsquo;s inclusion, expressing the view that its preference was for the  Assembly to have greater opportunity for scrutiny if changes were to be made to  the Bill when enacted or to other Acts. In its view, that would best be  achieved through primary legislation. Whereas clause 45 would have provided a  mechanism to amend existing statutory provisions by Order &mdash; such a mechanism is  widely used in other legislation that is subject to Committee scrutiny &mdash; it is  accepted that primary legislation would offer further opportunity for Members  to influence change during the legislation&rsquo;s passage through the Assembly.  Having carefully considered the Committee&rsquo;s concerns, I am content that clause  45 should not stand part of the Bill and that primary legislation be used as  the vehicle to make any necessary amendment to this important legislation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 9 relates to the Assembly control procedure  for two categories of regulations to be made under the Bill. The first category  comprises regulations that create criminal offences. Following its scrutiny of  the Bill, the Committee made a recommendation based on advice that it received  from the Examiner of Statutory Rules that regulations that create offences  should be laid in draft and approved by affirmative resolution. I am content to  accept the recommendation, and I thank the Committee for that and for its  detailed consideration.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The second category of regulation to which the amendment  applies is regulations in respect of shared transport facilities. Translink,  the Northern Ireland Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the  Federation of Passenger Transport raised issues in their evidence to the Committee  about the broad definition of &ldquo;place&rdquo; in respect of shared facilities. As a  result, the Department and the Committee agreed that the regulations in respect  of shared transport facilities should be laid in draft and made subject to  affirmative resolution of the Assembly. That will allow the Assembly to  scrutinise future regulations that further define places that are to be  designed as shared facilities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment Nos 10 and 11 relate to the inclusion of vehicle  examiners appointed by the Department of the Environment in the definition of  &ldquo;authorised person&rdquo;. Under the reform proposals, the Department of the  Environment will continue to be responsible for bus operator licensing and  vehicle safety. It has power under article 74 of the Road Traffic Order 1995 to  appoint vehicle examiners for the purposes of those functions. The Department  considers that those vehicle examiners should be included in the definition of  &ldquo;authorised person&rdquo; in the Bill, given the high level of synergy between the  functions. That would allow vehicle examiners to act on the provisions of the  Bill in the course of their duties and to take action on the instruction of the  Department for Regional Development.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 12 is a consequential amendment to clause 49,  which relates to the commencement, to remove what would be a redundant  reference to clause 45 following the opposition to that clause.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Regional Development</strong>: The Committee supports amendment  Nos 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12, which I have co-signed on its behalf.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee has given notice of its intention to oppose  the Question that clause 45 stand part of the Bill, because it was concerned by  the latitude provided to the Department under that clause to legislate by Order  in Council. The clause also allows the Department to make, by secondary  legislation, any provisions that it considers</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;necessary or expedient for the purposes of, in  consequence of or for giving full effect to this Act&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Orders made under the provision may</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;amend, repeal or modify any statutory provision  (including this Act)&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That means that the Department for Regional  Development could, through subordinate legislation in the form of an Order in  Council, amend or repeal primary legislation. However, an Order made in this way  would have to be subject to the affirmative procedure in the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee considered the clause carefully. Members were  aware that this type of clause, known as a Henry VIII clause, would allow a  Minister to make an Order that changes the law in a specific Act or in several  Acts. Members were concerned that such an Order would not have the same  scrutiny as a Bill and would deny the Assembly an opportunity to amend the  provision. It could in theory reverse parts of the Bill that had been agreed by  the Committee. Although the power is subject to the affirmative resolution  procedure, the Assembly would be able to vote only yes or no to an Order. Such  an Order could bring through relatively controversial plans without the  scrutiny that a Bill would receive.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">During evidence from the Department, the Committee asked  whether the power was really necessary. Members also queried the wide-ranging  nature of the power as drafted, and consideration was given to whether the  clause might be more tightly drawn. Officials also provided clarification on  the instances in which the power might be needed arising from the Bill. After  deliberations and having considered all the evidence that was received on  clause 45, the Committee was of the view that, in such a permissive Bill, in  which the majority of the detail on service agreements and permits is laid down  in regulation, and given that the public transport reform policy and processes  have yet to be clarified and implemented, it was not content with the clause.  Therefore, the Committee for Regional Development recommended that the  Assembly, at Consideration Stage, votes against the Question that the clause  stand part of the Bill. The Minister has indicated that he does not oppose the  Committee&rsquo;s objections to the clause, and the Committee appreciates his support  on the issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 9 has been tabled to address two issues that  arose during the Committee&rsquo;s scrutiny of the Bill. The first is the need to  ensure consultation with a wide range of stakeholders and an opportunity for  Assembly debate on any subordinate legislation that is developed on access to  shared transport facilities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee considered the arguments made in the  significant amount of written and oral evidence received on the arrangements  for access to shared transport facilities set out in clause 43. Members were  sympathetic to the understandable desire on the part of both Translink and the  Federation of Passenger Transport for greater clarity on what the term &ldquo;any  place&rdquo;, which is contained in the clause, might mean. The Committee was also  keenly aware of the health and safety concerns raised by the Northern Ireland  Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and Translink. However, the  Committee was clear that this Bill was not the appropriate vehicle through  which to deliver the detail required to address the complex issues raised in  evidence. In recognition of the sensitivities and complexities of this matter  and mindful of the need for flexibility as the process of public transport reform  progresses, the Committee made the following recommendations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee recommended that the development of  regulations on shared facilities should be characterised by consultation with  all interested parties, including the trade unions, Translink, the private  operators and the Consumer Council, as well as community transport providers.  In addition, the Committee recommended that the regulation-making powers in  this clause, which will provide for access to and identify the nature of shared  transport facilities, should be subject to the affirmative procedure of the  Assembly. That will ensure that there will be full opportunity for Committee  consideration as well as scrutiny and debate by the Assembly in the making of  regulations on shared transport facilities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The second issue that amendment No 9 addresses is the need  to ensure that regulations creating and amending offences arising from this  Bill will be subject to the affirmative procedure rather than negative  resolution of the Assembly. The Committee considered clause 46 in conjunction  with the delegated powers memorandum submitted by the Department for Regional  Development and the advice received from the Examiner of Statutory Rules on the  delegated powers in the Bill. The Committee was content, in general, that the  powers to make subordinate legislation seem to be appropriate as regards the  level of Assembly scrutiny to which they are subject. However, as in the case  of the Roads (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, the Committee was of the view  that there is an important principle to consider, which is that, generally,  provision to create offences in regulations should be subject to the  affirmative procedure. The Committee proposed those recommendations, and the  Department accepted them during Committee Stage. The Committee appreciates the  Minister&rsquo;s support and thanks him for tabling this amendment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee supports amendment Nos 10 and 11. During the  scrutiny of clause 7 and clauses 25 to 31, the Department indicated to the  Committee that it wished to amend the Bill to include enforcement officers in  the Department of the Environment within the definition of &ldquo;authorised  persons&rdquo;. The Committee supported that change, which it considered to be  sensible and a good example of how Departments can work together. In its  report, the Committee further recommended that, as the public transport reform  process is implemented, the operational efficiency and effectiveness of the  enforcement arrangements within DRD and between DRD and DOE should be monitored  on an ongoing basis.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The final amendment in this group, amendment No 12, is a  consequential amendment that arises from the Committee&rsquo;s opposition to clause  45.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That concludes my comments on the clauses and amendments in  this group.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Leonard</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I will restrict my comments on  this group to two points and will keep them brief.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In respect of amendment No 9 on shared transport  facilities, the Chairperson has more than adequately explained the Committee&rsquo;s  thinking. Let us hope that common sense will prevail and that the shared  facilities issue will be worked out in a way that benefits the community and  makes sense for it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My second point relates to clause 45. Little did I think  that good old Henry VIII would still be posing problems in 2011. The Committee  questioned, as did I, how much power was needed to make amendments. I thought  that it was sensible that we made the Committee&rsquo;s position clear and that the  Department and the Minister took on board the position that, for serious issues  to be amended down the line, the Assembly should be given its rightful place  and primary legislation should be required.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That was a bit of safeguarding. OK, there could have been a  lot of theorising about future scenarios for which it would be applicable.  However, common sense has prevailed. We will let Henry have the day off by  doing away with clause 45. I am glad that the Department and the Minister have  agreed to that.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">1.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I, too, thank the officials from the Assembly and the  Department and the Committee staff for all their help on the Bill as it went  through Committee.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I will confine my remarks to the intention to delete clause 45. Clause 45, as  drafted, is very serious. It states:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Department may by order make such incidental,  supplementary, consequential, transitory, transitional or saving provisions as  it considers necessary or expedient for the purposes of, in consequence of or  for giving full effect to this Act or any provision of it, or in connection  with the coming into operation of any provision of this Act.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">It continues:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;An order under this section may amend, repeal or  modify any statutory provision (including this Act).&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In other words, it gives the Minister or the Department the  power to do anything that they want with the Act. Such clauses get their name  from Henry VIII for good reason. He was a monarch who had the power to do  anything and kept changing the rules when they did not suit him. I am glad that  we have saved the Minister&rsquo;s blushes and prevented him from going down in  history as the Henry VIII of the Northern Ireland Assembly. I am happy that  clause 45 will no longer be part of the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">From the research that was provided to us when we  scrutinised the clause, it was obvious to me that this is not just something  that the Department for Regional Development might be inclined to do but a type  of clause that is commonly used in Northern Ireland legislation. All  of us, as legislators, may want to be mindful of that. There seems little point  in coming here and making laws only to give Departments or future Ministers the  opportunity to unmake them at the stroke of a pen at any point in the years to  come.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank colleagues for their co-operation on the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I thank Members for their contribution to the debate  on the second group of amendments.

    <p class="B3BodyText">This amendment changes the date for the commencement of the  Bill from September 2010 to the date on which it gains Royal Assent. The reason  for the amendment is that the Bill was originally printed for consideration  prior to last summer&rsquo;s recess.

The replacement allowances provisions, as agreed by the  Assembly on 13 December 2010, will also come into operation on that date.</p>

    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr Wells)</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That, in accordance with Standing Order 33(4), the period  referred to in Standing Order 33(2) be extended to 11 February 2011, in  relation to the Committee Stage of the Autism Bill [NIA Bill 2/10].</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Autism Bill passed its Second Stage on 7 December 2010,  and, under the 30-working-day rule, it should complete its Committee Stage on 8  February 2011. However, as Members know, the Bill is complex, and, ideally, the  Committee would be seeking a much longer extension.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are committed to scrutinising the Bill in a timely  fashion to allow enough time for it to progress through the necessary  legislative stages before the House is dissolved on 24 March. The Committee,  therefore, seeks a short extension of just two days to bring the deadline from  8 February 2011 to 11 February 2011. That would allow the Committee to have one  extra meeting to complete its consideration of the Bill. I ask Members for  their support.</p>

    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30  minutes for the debate. The proposer will have 10 minutes to propose the motion  and 10 minutes to make a winding-up speech. All other Members who are called to  speak will have five minutes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>: I  beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly notes with concern the restrictions placed  by the Department of Education on primary-school principals and teachers who  wish to advise parents and pupils on post-primary transfer matters following  the issue of post-primary test results; and calls on the Minister of Education  to review her decision.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion raises an issue of serious concern about  guidance that the Department of Education issued on 9 November 2010 in a  departmental circular about post-primary transfer. In the foreword, the  Minister states that the policy outlined in the document reflects the  Department&rsquo;s policy on post-primary transfer, namely transfer 2011. Indeed, I  have a copy of the document here.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We know only too well that the Minister opposes any form of  post-primary transfer examination and that her party scrapped the  state-sponsored academic selection process but failed to get rid of it in its  entirety. In the Minister&rsquo;s foreword to the circular, she highlights that the  policy will operate in the same way as the previous policy, that is, transfer  2010. The only change that the Minister makes is laid out in a crystal clear  way in her foreword, which is central to the purpose behind the motion. The  Minister states:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;In many respects, Transfer 2011 will operate in a  similar way to Transfer 2010, however, I have decided to make one change to the  process. It is clearly very important that primary-school principals continue  to offer their help and advice to all P7 parents. It is also very important  that the primary school principal&rsquo;s role in transfer is clear and receives the  support of the Department. I am aware that many principals are unhappy about  being placed in a difficult position by the actions of grammar schools  operating breakaway entrance tests. Primary-school principals have no  involvement in these tests and it is inappropriate, and indeed unfair, to  expect them to provide advice on any aspect of these tests or associated  procedures.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">1.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is clear that the Minister, despite failing to end  academic selection, is attempting to, once again, exert her opinion and  controversial policy by means of coercion, as is reflected in her strong  language. It resorts to bullying parents into accepting her opinion on the  transfer test. The Minister refers to &ldquo;breakaway transfer entrance tests&rdquo;,  which is, quite frankly, insulting to those experienced and reputable  individuals and groups who have played a vital role in ensuring that parents  and schools have a choice. That choice was secured by this party at St Andrews. Many of those who are involved in the  breakaway groups that are responsible for setting the entrance exams have  worked in education for all their lives. If anyone knows what is best, it is  them, not necessarily &mdash; dare I say it &mdash; us politicians.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The policy is enforced by the setting of a deadline for  interviews with school principals, which is 4 February 2011. I am sure that  Members will note with interest the significance of that date. On Saturday 5  February, children who sat the breakaway exams &mdash; as they were described &mdash; will  receive their results. The fact is made plain in the document. Parents whose  children have sat one of the breakaway tests will be hindered in receiving  advice and making an informed decision about their child&rsquo;s future because  school principals have effectively been told by the Minister that they must not  hold any interviews with parents past 4 February. That could be compared with a  diktat that completely ignores the reality of the situation. It casts aside  children who have sat any breakaway post-primary entrance exam.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If anyone thought that a principal can ignore the advice of  the Minister and work for the benefit of the children, which they are trained  to do, they are wrong. It is highlighted in bold in the circular that any  principal who holds transfer interviews after the date specified will not be  eligible for substitute teacher cover. That is enforced by a letter from the  Department dated 9 December 2010, in which principals are warned that if they  include any teacher cover after 4 February, the cost will not be met by the  Department.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The circular also warns principals about the cuts to their  budgets, which were announced by the Minister of Education last week. Therefore,  principals are restricted further in being able to fulfil their obligations to  their children and parents in providing advice on post-primary transfer beyond  Friday 4 February. That date is less than two weeks away, and the circular has  created further anxiety for the parents of children who are expecting results  on Saturday 5 February. Parents will be put in a difficult position in making  informed decisions about their children&rsquo;s future. The circular is yet another  example of the Minister&rsquo;s failure to reach a consensus on this issue, which has  caused significant anxiety among parents, children and teachers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I found it fascinating that the Minister&rsquo;s guidance notes  say that one thing that parents should be doing to prepare for this role is:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;How schools will select children for admission if  they have too many applicants. In this situation schools have to use admissions  criteria&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Like it or not, we all know that grammar schools  will use the criterion of the entrance test for that purpose. The Minister&rsquo;s own  guidance contradicts her in that respect. If she does not give the principals  the right to advise parents on the results, they cannot fulfil the criteria  that she has set.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I apologise for not being in the  Chamber at the start of the debate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The question that has to be asked is whether the debate is  about education or about an agenda, dating back to 2006, of protecting one  section of the education system, namely the grammar schools. Even within that group,  there is a subsection that refers to itself as the elite among grammar schools  and education. Those schools set themselves apart as different and not on a par  with the rest of the education system, and I emphasise that point. It is worth  noting that the same curriculum is taught to all pupils, whether the sign on  their school gate says grammar school, college or post-primary school. They all  teach the same curriculum. In any given school, whether a child receives a good  education is down to the enthusiasm and dedication of the staff. It is not down  to the nameplate on the school gate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion mentions meetings between parents whose children  are involved in the transfer process and principals. However, as I listened to  the Member who proposed the motion, I realised that it is not about the parents  of children transferring to all schools. The Member is interested only in the  parents of children who sat a transfer test to move to other schools. That is  the flaw in the system thus far. The Minister proposed moving those meetings to  a different time. She proposed a system that values all children and parents  and in which they can meet teachers and the headmaster of the prospective  school to discuss options, how the child performed in their last year of primary  school and the terms of the transfer. That is what the Minister proposes. It is  not just about one section of pupils in society.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is also worth noting that there is a responsibility in  the motion for all post-primary schools, because it is about the relationship  between primary schools and post-primary schools. To date, in the eyes of many  grammar schools, primary schools have been subservient to them, existing almost  as a corralling system for children. The children whom grammar schools decided  to select moved on to grammar school, and those whom they decided to reject  moved on to another school. Surely, if we are to improve educational outcomes,  primary schools must be centres of educational excellence. They should be  focused on providing an education to each child, rather than on how to move  children on in a way that meets the needs of the next school.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Yes, there has to be a relationship, but it must be based  on equality. Primary-school principals, teachers and classroom assistants are  all educationalists, as are the staff in whatever schools their children move  on to afterwards. The debate should signal to the education system that all  schools are equal and that the post-primary schools that offer selection and  rejection tests have a responsibility to keep children and parents informed  about how that process works. In repeated guidance issued by the Minister over  several years, the message to parents was that there is a legal onus on  post-primary schools, regardless of whether they select and reject 11-year-old  children or are inclusive, to give information to parents. The system envisaged  under the Minister&rsquo;s proposals will treat all children equally.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I return to the point that I made at the start. Is the  debate about education or elitism? As this may be the last education debate of  this session, perhaps somebody from the DUP will tell me why it chose to bring  a debate on education to the St Andrews talks  on constitutional issues. On whose behalf was it acting, and on whose behalf  was that item put on the agenda? Why did the DUP decide to bring academic  selection &mdash; an education issue &mdash; to political talks at St   Andrews?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. There are a number of things  about circular 2010/12 with which I am not happy, the first of which is its  legal basis. Page 5 of the circular says that it does not constitute an  authoritative legal interpretation of the various pieces of legislation that  are relevant to the North of Ireland. One has to ask the Minister what exactly  that means. If we cannot be sure about the legal basis of the circular, should  we ask school principals to abide by it? It can hardly be inspiring to school  principals to have to wonder whether the advice that they are being told to  follow is legal. I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s comments on that point.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Quite apart from the legality or otherwise of the circular,  there is no doubt that it is, in essence, an assault on the professionalism of  head teachers. I believe that head teachers are well equipped to make their own  professional judgements on their role in giving advice to parents and pupils.  The circular is a dangerous departure in so far as it seeks to micromanage the  work of experienced professionals who feel that they have a responsibility to pupils  and parents and who find themselves in an unresolved situation that is not of  their own making. Is it right that parents should be denied access to  professional advice from the people who are best placed to give that advice?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In some senses, the formal detail of the issue is less  significant than the fact that the debate has ended up with the Minister  issuing threats to a group of people who should have been allies in a  progressive movement towards change. It looks like the Minister&rsquo;s final attempt  to interfere with the unofficial system that is being operated by the grammar  schools, and, since there appears to be little or nothing that she can do to  the grammar schools, she has chosen instead to focus her attention and efforts  on the primary schools, which, once again, find themselves caught in an  invidious position in the fight between the Minister and the grammars. The  primary-school principals have once again been used as cannon fodder in the war  between the Minister and the grammar schools. Her failure to negotiate a  compromise or to come up with creative options for a solution have placed the  primary schools in an impossible position as they try to meet the directives  issued by the Department while maintaining a positive relationship with parents  by providing them with the best possible support for their children.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is plenty of evidence that, like my party, most  primary-school principals want to see the end of academic selection and would  much prefer to focus their energies on constructive educational priorities.  However, it is also understandable that they will try to do their best by all  their pupils in the difficult circumstances that have been created by  unofficial testing. I strongly suspect that most primary-school principals  will, in practice, ignore the Minister&rsquo;s directive and do their best to provide  dispassionate advice to the parents of children in P7, including advice on  post-primary options.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is a lamentable end to the Minister&rsquo;s handling of this  admittedly difficult issue that her final throw of the dice is effectively an  attack on one of the key groups that she always claimed she was trying to help:  primary-school principals. As she comes towards the end of her term in office,  it is difficult to think of any group that she has not alienated during this  whole sorry saga. Her energies would have been better spent on building a  positive coalition for change. However, that appears to be beyond either her  temperament or her political style. As we move towards the end of this mandate,  the Minister of Education &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Bring your remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  &mdash; will have little to survey by way of success.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Her claims that she has brought an end to academic  selection are clearly ill founded. She has not ended academic selection but has  merely managed to privatise it.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: I  support the motion. It refers to advice interviews following the issuing of  post-primary test results, and that is exactly the point. The advice that is  given in the circular to which Jonathan Craig referred makes it clear that the  interviews have to take place before the test results are issued. I have not  seen that circular, to be honest, but I have a letter from the South Eastern  Board to a school that confirms the same thing. It states:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Funding for the substitute cover that facilitates a  primary school&rsquo;s principal&rsquo;s involvement in transfer interviews will be  confined to interviews that take place on or before 4 February 2011.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I also took note of paragraph 5.23 of the  Department&rsquo;s draft budget, which states:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;DE policy is for a non-selective system.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">It continues:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;DE is consulting on a proposal to remove the facility  for primary schools to claim for substitute cover in relation to the transfer  procedure.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">It is fairly clear what is happening.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">People probably know by now where I stand on the long-term  future of academic selection. I want to see an end to it, through being  legislated away, withering on the vine or being made to disappear by agreement.  I do not really care, but its time has passed, and the sooner we can get rid of  it, the better. In the meantime, I do not see much point in ignoring the  reality of the situation, which is that, whether or not there is a transfer  system, children of age 10 and their parents need advice from the headmaster of  their primary school and their P7 teacher at what is a stressful time in their  life.</p>
    <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Speaker in the Chair)</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I understand that getting advice from the P7 teacher is the  current practice. All that will happen is that the primary schools will have to  fall in line with the policy to some extent by conducting their interviews in  the next couple of weeks. The parents of children who have done the transfer  test will, undoubtedly, have to have a further interview. All that that does is  put extra work, in particular, on to primary school heads who are already  hard-pressed and probably scratching their head about what to do when faced  with the onslaught of advice that comes from the Department. That is  particularly the case for primary schools that are close to grammar schools,  but primary schools are not allowed to conduct the selection test in the  school. However, having the test there would be a better option for the  children&rsquo;s well-being. The schools cannot do anything about that. Strictly  speaking, they are not allowed to prepare pupils for the tests. They have to  teach the curriculum, and the reality is probably slightly &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>:  Yes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Will the Member agree that his last statement sums it up? He said that the  school has to teach the curriculum. What is wrong with a school being  instructed to teach the curriculum and not to break away from it and teach for  an unregulated test? That is a fair statement.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member will have a minute added to his time.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>:  Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. Believe it or not, I do not disagree with Mr  O&rsquo;Dowd. Ideally, I would like no selection tests and for primary school  teachers to be allowed to teach the curriculum with no necessity to coach their  pupils for tests. However, there is also the reality of what is happening at  the moment. Primary school heads &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>:  Just a minute. Primary school heads and teachers have no option, because they  are faced with a different pressure &mdash; pressure from parents to bring forward  their children for the tests, which I wish we could get rid of. I know that  that might sound a bit contradictory, but, in the meantime, I want to talk only  about the interviews, because that is what the motion is about.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I find it hard to escape the view that, frankly, this is  another vindictive action by the Department. As Dominic Bradley said, it is  another means of putting pressure on primary school heads and teachers to drive  another nail into the coffin of academic selection. It is not going to work.  What is best for the children? Surely, they must get that advice. It is not  reasonable to ask headmasters and P7 teachers to do that without substitute  cover being paid for, particularly now that there is a deadline. That means  that they will have to do it twice.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>: I  will not enter into the debate about whether it is right, wrong or indifferent  to have academic selection: the Member will know that we differ on that issue.  However, does he agree that this approach is similar to a lot of the approaches  that the Minister has taken? It is the emu approach, where she buries her head  in the sand and refuses to accept what is happening. In some primary schools,  more than 80% of the children will participate in the tests, and, ultimately,  the head teacher will have to give advice to the parents.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>:  That is pretty much what I said, without comparing the Minister to an emu. Mr  Speaker, I will conclude because I can see that my time is nearly up. We  support the motion, but I want to make it clear once again that we are  absolutely against academic selection.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Mr Speaker, as you will expect, I support the motion and congratulate my  colleagues on tabling it. It is clear for everyone to see that old habits die  hard, especially when it comes to the current Education Minister. It seems as  though the conflict, confusion and challenge that dominated the history of Sinn  F&eacute;in was not dispensed with when the party appointed Caitr&iacute;ona Ruane as  Education Minister. Instead, what the Minister decided to do was in total  variance to her colleague and former Education Minister, Martin McGuinness. In  an article in the &lsquo;Belfast Telegraph&rsquo;, the former Education Minister said:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;We need co-operation not continued conflict.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">He went on to say:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Education does not have to be conflictual.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">What has been the hallmark of the tenure of the  Education Minister who is in the House today? It is to be malevolent and be  involved in meddling and mischief making, in the hope that, somehow, by some  other means, she will be able to wear down the system in such a way that people  will ultimately roll over and allow her ideological position to take  precedence.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">What we are hearing in today&rsquo;s debate is yet another attack  in a long line of attacks that the Education Minister has made on those whom  she wants to change ideologically. However, therein lies her problem:  ideological positions will remain so only if they are not reflected in  legislation. Whether the Education Minister wants to accept it or not, the  legal position is clear. If the Minister has the decency and good manners to  listen &mdash; that has never been a trademark of her time as Minister &mdash; I will quote  what she said about the guidance that the Department issued from the Minister.  She said that it does not in itself have statutory force.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We all remember the issue about parents taking their  children out of school and taking them to a foreign country. There is guidance  on that issue, but the Education Minister interpreted that guidance as a  parent, as she had a right to do.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister sent letters to schools operating what she  calls &ldquo;private tests&rdquo;. She asked for information relating to the funding  arrangements for the payment of those tests, but she has been informed that she  has no legal right to ask that of the schools. She was meddling.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">What has the Minister done in relation to the appointment  of members to the education and library boards? She has delayed and  dilly-dallied in the hope that somehow they will not be reconstituted under the  legislation and that somehow the dream world of the ESA will come into  operation by stealth and other means. The motion deals with yet another example  in the long history of how the Minister operates.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to answer a question that was asked by John O&rsquo;Dowd.  He asked why the DUP brought the issue of academic selection to St Andrews. I will tell you why, Mr Speaker. It did so  because a previous Education Minister abolished one system but failed miserably  to put in place an alternative. Until an alternative system is agreed and put  in place, the legal framework and legal right of schools to use academic  criteria in admissions policy will continue.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Givan</strong>:  Does the Member agree that at every attempt by Sinn F&eacute;in to pursue its agenda  it has been the DUP, through the Assembly, that has stopped that agenda and  that Sinn F&eacute;in can lay claim to no success?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member will have a minute added to his time.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  That is true. It is why, out of the blue, Mr O&rsquo;Dowd recently had to put an  article in a newspaper to defend the current Minister as though, somehow &mdash; if  there were to be no Sinn F&eacute;in Education Minister in the next mandate and new  Assembly &mdash; the party&rsquo;s policy to abolish the 11-plus had been successful. It has  not been successful. The fact is that tests are now operated within the law.  Therefore, the Minister and Sinn F&eacute;in have to realise that there must be  consensus. Why did the party opposite stay outside talks on finding a way  forward?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  am glad that Mr Storey brought up the subject of the &lsquo;Belfast Telegraph&rsquo; talks.  A presentation to the Committee for Education the other day &mdash; six months after  the report was delivered to it &mdash; showed clearly that no agreement had been  reached in those talks. In fact, the issue had not even been discussed.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  That just shows how incapable some Members are of reading an entire document.  It indicated that there is willingness among major stakeholders to deal with  the issue. However, what has the Minister done?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member must bring his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  As with any other issue, such as her failure to deal with end-year flexibility  when she had to get the Minister of Finance to find a solution to her problem,  it will be for other people, not the failed Minister of Education, to find a  solution for the future of education.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Comments by the previous Member show  that Members opposite are present only to debate the topic in the interests of  the select number of children whom they wish to represent. The motion refers &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  Let me get going.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Will the Member allow me respond to her point?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  I will not give way. Maybe I will do so later in my contribution.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion refers to restrictions being placed on schools  and principals who wish to advise parents on post-primary transfer matters  following the issue of unregulated test results. Perhaps the supporters of the  motion need to reread the circular that was issued by the Department. It  clearly sets out and recognises the importance of primary-school principals  offering help and advice to all parents of children in P7. It goes on to state  that it is important that the primary school principal&rsquo;s role in transfer is  clear and that it receives the Department&rsquo;s support.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is right and proper that principals make themselves  available to parents who have concerns about their children&rsquo;s educational  experience, which is what they do at present. We are all aware that they are  amenable and open to speaking to parents when necessary. We are also aware that  they will continue to do that. However, the Assembly cannot continue to support  a two-tier system of educational support.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Holding an interview before the issue of unregulated  transfer results makes it clear to parents and everyone involved that primary  schools have absolutely no involvement in the academic selection process being  run by grammar schools. Principals will meet parents on or before 4 February  2011 to advise them. That is set out in the circular, which also states that  principals will invite parents of children in P7 to an interview to advise them  on completing transfer forms. It could be no clearer. I do not see how the  supporters of the motion see that as a restrictive comment, as it shows that  principals are open to speaking to parents as needed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, the process that has been outlined by the  Department is in line with that for other milestones in a child&rsquo;s educational  journey. For example, when parents apply for their children to be admitted to  nursery or preschool, who assists them with the completion of the form? They do  it themselves. Who assists parents with the form when they apply for their  child to go to primary school? Parents do that themselves. That proves that the  measures should be sufficient for the majority of parents to ensure that a  transfer form is completed in a correct and timely manner. However, we  recognise that there are instances in which parents may need advice. There  could be various reasons for that, such as literacy problems or language  difficulties. Those will be considered as exceptional circumstances, and an  interview can be conducted in those situations.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Dominic Bradley talked about the professionalism of  principals, who can use their discretion on when an interview is necessary.  That is common sense; that is what principals do. It was the principals who  asked for clarification and to be divorced from the situation, because they do  not want to be involved in something that is unregulated and nothing to do with  them. I, therefore, think that it is right and proper that the situation has  been clarified. In the long run, it will benefit principals. Teachers want to  teach children. They do not want to be teaching to exams; they want to be  totally divorced from an unregulated system that is being run by the  academically selective schools.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">For those reasons, Sinn F&eacute;in will continue to protect the  rights of all children in the education system. We do not stand up for a select  number of children; we stand up for all children.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: Let  me be clear from the outset that the reason why this motion was brought before  the House was to enable us to look at what is in the educational best interests  of all children, based on their ability to learn. That is the purpose of the  motion. It has not been mentioned, but the elephant in the living room is that  the Northern Ireland  education system sends more young working-class people to university than that  in any other part of the United    Kingdom. That is a statistic that we should  be proud of and an education system that we should look to defend and enhance.  Over the past number of years, the history has not been a successful one for  the House. We have not had educational success based on consensus; we have had  systematic confrontation. The higher the barriers that have been built, the  stronger the people have become to defend a system of education that places  more working-class children in university than in any other part of the United Kingdom.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I declare an interest as a governor of a grammar school,  and I have a family member who is the school principal. I say to the Education  Minister that we are looking for the politics of educational success, not the  politics of educational spite. To place a restriction on principals who are  giving genuine information to parents the day before the results come out  cannot be anything other than the politics of educational spite, for the  purpose of driving a dogma and a philosophy. It is not there for the purpose of  allowing the child with the results to have a proper debate or analysis with an  education professional on where their future best lies.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It was difficult for many of us who have watched politics  for years. We saw Mr Adams, with an obstructionist approach to Northern Ireland  education.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Who?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: We  saw the politics of confrontation, and the approach of obstruction and  confrontation was carried on. I am referring to the man who has gone away, you  know. I am referring to the man who has gone away to be a paid Crown Minister.  I understand that the only way that he can resign from the House of Commons is  to be in the service and employment of the Crown. I do not know whether he will  be baron of Northampton.  Anyway, I am referring to the man who has gone away.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That politics of obstruction and confrontation was met not  with an equal and opposite reaction from those who had a genuine belief in  education but by a better reaction. As a result of that, the academic  qualifications and tests that are needed were set. Some argue that three tests  offer young people a fairer chance than two tests. The schools that wish to use  that as their selection criterion can use it and have used it, but nobody is  forcing them to do so. As a governor of Regent House, I can see that the number  of parents applying to the school is vastly greater than the number of places  that we can offer. It is good for the children, and it is good for the parents.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  am not aware of the school, so I may be putting the Member in a difficult  position. Does the grammar school of which Mr Bell is a governor adhere to an A  to B category? Or does it do what the majority of grammar schools do and take  all comers from the surrounding schools and leave their numbers falling?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member will have a minute added to his time.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>:  Thank you very much. It is a grammar school that firmly complies with the law  and offers a choice. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>:  There are other good schools in the area that do not take that approach, and I  do not take anything away from them, but that one does, and the parents and  children want it. They apply for it in greater numbers than there are places  for the school to give.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We need to move from the politics of confrontation to the  politics of consensus. Does the Minister think for a second that, because of  that circular, parents are not going to turn up on 6, 7 and 8 February and ask  the teacher at the school gate or the principal for their advice? It is just  nonsense. We need to lift the restrictions to allow parents to have a genuine  choice and to allow the children to get the information. If the argument is so  successful &mdash; we are told that they should not want to go to those schools &mdash; let  the children and their parents make their decision, but do not restrict a  system that is working.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in may believe that the politics of confrontation  will be successful; however, I think it was Einstein who said that the  definition of insanity is doing what we have always done and expecting a  different result. For four years they have stonewalled and been confrontational  and obstructive, and what result have they got? They have academic selection  with more applications than places, and they have ended up with the education  system that they tried to change and failed lamentably. Now is the time for  consensus.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I say to the Minister that it is not a shame to change your  mind when the facts change, and the facts have changed. Academic selection is  going to be here to stay, because it is right for parents and for children. I  ask for change that is in the best interests of all our children.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  When assessment is made of the current Assembly I am, sadly, confident that the  greatest failure will be deemed to be the manner in which the education brief  has been handled by the Minister. Contrary to any pronouncements that the  Minister or the DUP have made, the educational needs of pupils and parents have  often been secondary to political and often ideological disputes. We must think  of the children and their parents first.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister uses words such as &ldquo;injustice&rdquo;, &ldquo;inequality&rdquo;  and &ldquo;fundamentally immoral&rdquo; when she describes the transfer method using  academic criteria. Those are the words not of a Minister looking after all but  of an ideologue who places her narrow political goals ahead of the needs and  choices of parents and children. Thankfully, we have parental choice. Transfer  selection by academic criteria is legal in Northern Ireland, but it is because  of the Minister&rsquo;s unwillingness to engage with her Assembly and Executive  colleagues that grammar schools have had to act independently in order to meet  the needs of those children and parents.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister&rsquo;s decision is another direct attack on parents  who want to send their children to schools that specialise in academic  excellence. It further places primary-school principals and teachers in an  extremely difficult position. The Minister&rsquo;s foreword to the Department&rsquo;s  procedure for transfer from primary to post-primary education 2011-12 states:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;It is important that recipients read this document  carefully to ensure that the process of transfer remains functional and  coherent in the interests of all children and their parents.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I question how she can say that it delivers that.  The latest transfer guidance has been designed by the Minister with the single  intent of diminishing the interests and needs of children and parents who want  to send their children to schools that specialise in academic excellence. That  is fundamentally immoral. Where is the interest of those children and their  parents in that decision?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister knows that the results of the transfer tests  go out on 5 February, so it appears that she has deliberately issued a decree  about the important parent/teacher interview, which is designed to ensure that  parents and children make an informed choice about transfer. She has almost  deliberately decided to cause difficulty in enabling them to receive the best  advice from the principals, who will know the child on the basis of knowledge  of any outcomes that will arise. Presumably that is why 4 February and 5  February are significant dates. She is attempting to prevent that useful  information from being imparted to children and their parents.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In guidance on the transfer procedure, the Minister  followed the decree with the threat that:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;any transfer interviews conducted after 4 February  2011 will not be considered by the Department to be part of the transfer  procedure and will not therefore be eligible for substitute teacher cover&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Where is the delegation of duties to schools,  principals and governors in making choices about how they run their school?  That is a central diktat that the Minister is attempting to impose.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has placed primary-school principals and their  teachers in the invidious position of not being able to give that advice and  help. Transferring a child from one school to another is, at the best of times,  extremely stressful for children and their parents. However, the Minister  apparently wants to create a further vacuum that will lead to even more stress.  That is unacceptable.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The stakes in this educational dogfight are extremely high.  Northern Ireland  has a world-class education system that helps our economy and society to  develop. At the moment, however, due to an ideological spat, we are  jeopardising its future. The Ulster Unionist Party recognises that we need to  improve our educational underachievement significantly, especially among those  from underprivileged backgrounds. However, do you help them by removing  excellence? Rather than concentrating on areas where support and additional  help are needed, the Minister is trying to dumb down and lower standards.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I ask the Member to bring his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: It  would be much better if the Minister concentrated on educational  underachievement in order to raise all standards so that every child will reach  his or her full potential.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I ask the House to take its ease as we move into Question Time. We will come  back to the debate after Question Time, when the next Member to speak will be  Paul Givan.</p>

    <p class="OralAnswers-H2DepartmentHeading">Office of the First Minister and  deputy First Minister</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Sustainable Development Commission</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">1. <strong>Mr  Lyttle </strong>asked the First Minister and deputy First Minister what plans are  being put in place to ensure that the work currently carried out by the  Sustainable Development Commission will continue after 31 March 2011.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 835/11<a name="AQO835/11" id="AQO835/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister (Mr P Robinson)</strong>: Mr Speaker, with your permission, I will ask  junior Minister Newton to answer that question.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister) (Mr Newton)</strong>:  I thank the Member for his question. The UK Government announced their  intention to withdraw funding from the Sustainable Development Commission (SDC)  in July of last year. The impact of that decision is that, having considered  several options, we have reluctantly decided to wind-up the Sustainable  Development Commission in Northern    Ireland, with effect from 31 March.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The commission has provided valuable support to the  Executive in helping them to realise their sustainable development obligations  and ambitions. I acknowledge the efforts of everybody associated with the  organisation and the valuable work that they did.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As an Executive, we are committed to the principles of  sustainability and to progressing the priorities and strategic objectives set  out in the new sustainable development strategy. In that context, officials in  the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister (OFMDFM) have  examined options for the effective delivery of the Executive&rsquo;s sustainability  priorities. We are in the latter stages of finalising a structure that will  prepare and serve the Department well in delivering those targets and  objectives.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This is a requirement that is facing all Governments across  the devolved Administrations, all of whom are developing their own particular  solutions that are most appropriate to their needs. Our decisions must, of  course, be taken against the background of the spending pressures that all  Departments face. That is why we are seeking new and original solutions that  make the most of existing expertise and the resources that are available to us.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are conscious of the need to challenge convention and to  address the unacceptably high cost of delivering solutions through the old ways  of working. Since OFMDFM took responsibility for sustainable development, we  have developed our own expertise and established productive relationships, both  locally and internationally, inside and outside government. We want to utilise  and strengthen those relationships as far as possible in the pursuit of our  goals.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lyttle</strong>:  It is obviously disappointing to hear of the lack of funding for the  Sustainable Development Commission. What is the timescale for bringing forward  the alternative proposals? Has the Welsh Assembly&rsquo;s approach, of introducing an  independent advisory and scrutiny body, been considered?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr Newton)</strong>: In my answer to the substantive question, I said that  the devolved Administrations have to consider a solution that best suits them  and must consider that solution within the constraints of finance and  resources, which I outlined. We have been, and are, developing our own  expertise, both locally and internationally, which will serve Northern Ireland well.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Obviously, we will look at what is delivered in Wales, England  and Scotland,  and nothing will be ruled out. As I said, the commission will be wound-up on 31  March, and we are finalising our plan for the delivery of sustainable  development in that context, with the intention of having it in place following  the SDC closure.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Browne</strong>:  Will the junior Minister outline the cost implications of winding-up the  Sustainable Development Commission and those of the intended new structures?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr Newton)</strong>: I thank the Member for his question. At the risk of  repeating myself, cost is a major factor. As part of its remit, the project  board that is addressing the issue and overseeing the winding-up of the SDC has  been tasked with considering the whole issue, including the assets and the  liabilities. The assets appear to relate most significantly to intellectual  property and the ownership of SDC reports and publications. That is being  managed in the interim with the aim of ensuring future access to all those  valuable materials. Much of the research that has been done is invaluable, and Northern Ireland  needs ongoing access to it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The project board is working to minimise the risk of  liabilities associated with the wind-up. It is not clear at present whether  existing Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and SDC  resources will be sufficient to meet the necessary obligations relating to  redundancies and pension provision. We do, however, maintain that DEFRA&rsquo;s  unilateral decision to withdraw funding and, effectively, to precipitate the  closure of SDC suggests that the liabilities associated with doing so are a  matter for that Department. We have already made that opinion clear to the  Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and our colleagues  in the other devolved Administrations. The closure will result in some cost  savings to the Department. OFMDFM has, until now, contributed &pound;120,000 per  annum to the overall running costs of the organisation.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  T&aacute; ceist agam don Aire. I ask the Minister to be more specific and precise  about what structures are going to be put in place to carry on the work that is  being carried out by the Sustainable Development Commission at present.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr Newton)</strong>: I thank the Member for his question. I have already  said that that work is ongoing. We are working on a succession plan to replace  what was regarded as a very valuable organisation from a Northern Ireland perspective. I am  sure that that feeling is shared by the other devolved Administrations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The decision to close the organisation was taken by Caroline  Spelman. Each jurisdiction needs to look at what is relevant to its future  arrangements for the delivery of a sustainable development programme that is  designed to deliver its priorities in each context. Therefore, the arrangements  that will be put in place will vary because of the differences in the short-,  medium- and long-term priorities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">For Northern Ireland,  that means establishing working relationships that will enable us to deliver  the priorities and objectives of our sustainable delivery strategy by working  in ways that complement and build on the strengths of our arrangements in Northern Ireland.  We are aware that plans are being considered by other Administrations and that  different approaches are being taken in Scotland, Wales and England, some of  which involve external organisations and some of which involve government  organisations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A Northern Ireland  decision has not yet been taken, but work is ongoing, and I believe that we  will end up with a strategy and a delivery mechanism that will satisfy all Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  requirements.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading"><strong>HM  Coastguard</strong>: Bangor</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">2. <strong>Mr  Gibson </strong>asked the First Minister and deputy First Minister whether they  intend to lobby HM Government for the retention of Bangor Coastguard station.&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 836/11<a name="AQO836/11" id="AQO836/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: We recognise the level of concern that this matter has provoked  among public representatives of all parties, evidenced by the question being  asked of the Secretary of State for Northern   Ireland and the Prime Minister at Westminster. The coastguard rescue centre is  vital to people here, and we are delighted to see the growing campaign in the  media and local community to save it. The Executive will do all that they can  to influence any decision about the centre&rsquo;s future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Of course, we share everyone&rsquo;s concerns about people&rsquo;s  safety here and the potential impact on local employment but we are  particularly concerned that the closure of the coastguard rescue centre in Bangor would leave us as  the only devolved Administration without a coastguard presence. Although coastguard  services are a reserved matter, we will be responding formally to the  coastguard modernisation consultation, which runs until 24 March 2011. In  addition, I assure the Assembly that we will continue to pursue the matter  through normal channels and ensure that the strongest case for maintaining the Bangor station is made to  the Government.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gibson</strong>: I  appreciate and welcome the First Minister&rsquo;s response. Given that many major  shipping lanes pass along the County Down coast and that a major air corridor  passes over that area, and bearing in mind the fishing activity and  recreational boating that takes place in those coastal waters, does the First  Minister share my view that the local knowledge of the staff of the Bangor  coastguard station could prove vital in the event of an emergency?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: Absolutely. Local knowledge is the main aspect of our case. Place  names can be learnt quickly enough, but distances between various places, where  along the coast are the best places for rescue services to land, and all the  local knowledge that has been built up in Bangor  are essential ingredients. The deputy First Minister and I have been invited by  the Member of Parliament for the area, Lady Sylvia Hermon, to go down to look  at the existing services, and I would like to take up that invitation.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Given the review of maritime safety  taking place in the South, and that commenced by the London Government, and  also the high level of North/South co-operation on the issue, will  consideration be given to devolving responsibility for coastguard services to  the Executive and the development of all-island co-operation to co-ordinate  safety and coverage along that shared coastline?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I cannot envisage that all happening before 24 March.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is clear that this is a reserved matter, and the power  is held at Westminster.  We will respond to the consultation as the requirement is set down, and we will  consult with Ministers in GB about the way forward. I do not think that there  is any suitable alternative, whether in the Republic  of Ireland or Liverpool, to having a  facility in Northern Ireland  with the local knowledge and closeness to the job that is required.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  Will the First Minister outline what discussions have taken place, or will take  place, through the Joint Ministerial Committee (JMC) in London, where both he and the deputy First  Minister meet colleagues from the other devolved institutions, as well as,  probably, the Prime Minister and deputy Prime Minister? What discussions have  taken place at that level? Can discussions and referrals take place at that  committee? What further representations will be made to the Secretary of State  for Transport?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: The JMC meets, conveniently, next week. Although this is not an  agenda item, the issue will certainly be raised on the periphery of the  meeting. This is a reserved matter, and Westminster  has the power to take the decision. Our Members of Parliament can use their  influence at Westminster  as well, and I am sure that they will do that.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Equality Legislation</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">3. <strong>Mr  McCarthy </strong>asked the First Minister and deputy First Minister, in light of  the introduction in GB of the Equality Act 2010, what proposals are being  developed to address any deficiencies in equality legislation in Northern Ireland.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 837/11<a name="AQO837/11" id="AQO837/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: With your permission, Mr Speaker, I will ask junior Minister  Robin Newton to answer that question.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr Newton)</strong>: I thank the Member for his question. I know that he  has an ongoing interest in the area.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are considering the options for legislative reform.  However, we continue to legislate to meet our commitments under the Programme  for Government, EU obligations, case law requirements and emerging issues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Since the restoration of devolution, we have introduced  legislation to strengthen and to improve the rights of individuals in a number  of areas. We have introduced a number of changes to disability discrimination  legislation to improve the lives of disabled people here. For example, we have  amended the definition of &ldquo;disability&rdquo; so that people with progressive  conditions are deemed to be disabled from the point of diagnosis. We have made  it unlawful to treat a disabled person less favourably than others for  disability reasons in relation to the disposal or management of residential,  commercial and other premises. We have also imposed new duties on public  authorities and private clubs to make reasonable adjustments for disabled  people and we have made it unlawful for transport operators to discriminate  against the disabled person.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the area of gender equality, our law has been amended to  give effect to the European gender, goods and services directive and the equal  treatment amendment directive. We intend shortly to introduce legislation to  remove the default retirement age. We need to ensure that our citizens enjoy  the same protections as others across the EU, and we will, therefore, consider  the implications of those developments in deciding the future direction of  equality legislation here.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I thank the junior Minister for his response. Does he agree that it would be  most regrettable for the equality rights of the people of Northern Ireland to be less than  those of people across the water? After all, we are supposed to be in the UK.  Will the junior Minister give a commitment to support a single equality Bill in  the next Assembly, given that the issue has been around for five years or more?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr Newton)</strong>: In response to the Member&rsquo;s first question &mdash; his  first question &mdash; I say that I do not want anyone in Northern   Ireland to suffer or to be treated in any way less  favourably than anyone in any other part of the United Kingdom. In fact, we must  ensure that our citizens do not receive any less favourable treatment than  anyone throughout the whole EU. We are under obligations to ensure that. As  such, our intention is to ensure that favourable and comparable conditions are  available to all.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I remind Members that they should read Standing Orders. When it comes to a  supplementary question, only one question should be asked or one enquiry made.  I continually say to the entire House that there are Members who try to get in  multiple supplementaries. It will not work.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  The junior Minister outlined the deficiencies in existing equality legislation.  Can he undertake to keep under review the composition of the Equality  Commission, given its under-representation of Protestants and the work that it  does to address the under-representation of Protestants in the wider community?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr Newton)</strong>: I thank the Member for his supplementary question. I  know that he has raised the issue on a number of occasions. Indeed, it is an  issue that has received considerable and widespread press coverage. I suppose  that the Member&rsquo;s concern could apply to every issue, and it should be a  general concern of every Member. It is for the NIO to take up, and I know that  the Member has corresponded with the NIO on the matter.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms M Anderson</strong>: Go raibh  m&iacute;le maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his responses. I  ask him whether he heard the discussion on &lsquo;The Stephen Nolan Show&rsquo; this  morning about the case of Mrs McCluskey and the horrendous treatment that she  received from carers in her home. I must say, as someone who depends very much  on carers, that that is not the case across the board.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Listening to the programme, I heard that those who are  trying to ensure that it does not happen again &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I encourage the Member to come to her question.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms M Anderson</strong>: &mdash; were going  between the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety and the  Minister of Justice to try to find the legislative protections in place to  prevent such an incident from happening again. Therefore, what I would like to  ask the junior Minister is whether he will work to address the fragmented array  of legislative instruments that we have in place here, which apply different  strands of protections across the board. When he is making his deliberations &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I encourage the Member to finish.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms M Anderson</strong>: &mdash; I ask him  to look at that fragmented array of legislation and to try to bring it together  in one Bill so that we have the adequate protections here &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I must insist that the Member finish.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms M Anderson</strong>: &mdash; to prevent  such a case from happening again.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr Newton)</strong>: I did not hear &lsquo;The Stephen Nolan Show&rsquo; this morning.  If it is the matter that I caught on the lunchtime news, that is, the case of  an older person who was not receiving the attention that she deserved and was  entitled to in a care facility, it is an absolutely deplorable situation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I cannot see, however, how the issue might be solved.  Again, I am trying to read between the lines, where the Member is highlighting  her concerns about a single equality Bill. A person was taken before the courts  and received their due attention, while the family of the victim expressed  their satisfaction at the result of the court proceedings. If that is the case,  I am not sure how a single equality Bill, with all its associated costs, would  have helped in that situation.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Budget Review Group</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">4. <strong>Mr W  Clarke </strong>asked the First Minister and deputy First Minister whether the  Budget review group continues to meet and for an update on its work.&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 838/11<a name="AQO838/11" id="AQO838/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: The Budget review group played an important role in shaping the  draft Budget, including the identification of potential new sources of revenue  and options for maximising receipts and reducing bureaucracy. After the  publication of the draft Budget statement, the Budget review group met on 18  January. The group received an update on the Budget process to date and  considered strategic issues outlined in the draft Budget, including the  development of revenue-raising proposals and the initial work on the  arm&rsquo;s-length body review. We plan for the group to continue to meet over the  coming weeks as part of the process of developing the Budget. Indeed, the next  meeting is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the First Minister for his  response. Has the Budget review group identified any other revenue-raising  measures in addition to those in the draft Budget?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: We hope to progress that specific task at tomorrow&rsquo;s meeting,  which will be attended exclusively by representatives of the parties on the  Executive. Each party will consider proposals without prejudice and will make  suggestions about other sources of capital asset disposal, revenue or savings.  Tomorrow, and in the coming days, we will look at each of those in turn.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  Will the First Minister tell the House the dates of the two previous meetings  of the Budget review group before last week? Has the group come to any  conclusions about the Budget proposals on Belfast  port?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I could find out those dates for the Member, but he would  probably get them more easily from the representatives of his party who attend  those meetings.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There have been discussions at official level about the  funds that might be raised from Belfast  port, and we are seeking a meeting at ministerial level with senior port  officials. The Executive have several options about raising funds from the  port. We are discussing proposals from the Minister for Regional Development  that would allow us to raise more than the Budget allocation, which is some &pound;30  million. The Minister&rsquo;s proposal goes well beyond that, and we will want to  discuss the level and the mechanism with the port authorities.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I am sure that the First Minister will have noted the public comments from some  members of parties that are represented on the Executive that they do not  believe that they have been properly consulted about the draft Budget. Will the  First Minister confirm that all Executive parties are represented on the Budget  review group and that they have all been consulted extensively on the contents  of the draft Budget?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: When I heard one Minister say that he had seen the draft Budget  six hours before it was published, I was waiting for a bolt of lightning to hit  him. All Ministers on the Executive consulted officials in their respective  Departments, followed by extensive consultations with the Minister of Finance  and Personnel. Each party on the Executive is represented on the Budget review  group, which has had several lengthy meetings and will continue to do so. All  Executive parties were fully involved in the whole process, though for  political reasons some parties may wish to distance themselves from the kind of  cuts for which they encouraged people to vote.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  welcome the continuation of the work of the Budget review group to investigate  further Budget opportunities. Will the First Minister support the continuation  of a process to interrogate and to improve the Budget beyond March, when a  revised Budget will be presented to the Assembly?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: Yes, I will. The deputy First Minister and I agree that the  raising of revenue will not stop with the agreement &mdash; I hope &mdash; of the Budget  and its publication but will continue thereafter. If we can get additional  funds through other mechanisms after the date of the Budget, we can supplement  the Budget and allow a little more room to breathe in some of the Departments.  Therefore, the answer is very definitely yes.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Presbyterian Mutual Society</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">5. <strong>Mr  Bresland </strong>asked the First Minister and deputy First Minister what progress  has been made to date in resolving the Presbyterian Mutual Society issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 839/11<a name="AQO839/11" id="AQO839/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: Although this has been a lengthy and complex matter, significant  progress has been made towards resolving the Presbyterian Mutual Society (PMS)  issue. The ministerial working group reconvened on 21 July 2010 and met four  times between July and October. On 15 October, it reported to Prime Minister  David Cameron with a proposed solution. The solution involves a loan to the  administrator to allow an orderly disposal of PMS assets over a 10-year period,  payment to creditors and the creation of a mutual access fund to give members  early access to their funds. It is based on a &pound;175 million loan to the  administrator and a mutual access fund to which the United Kingdom Government  have committed &pound;25 million, the Executive will commit &pound;25 million and the  Presbyterian Church will also make a contribution.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The United Kingdom Government&rsquo;s contribution of &pound;25 million  to the mutual access fund was confirmed in the spending review announced on 20  October 2010, which also confirmed that Northern Ireland&rsquo;s reinvestment and  reform initiative borrowing facility would be increased by &pound;175 million in  2011-12 to be used on our capital projects to free up resources to facilitate a  loan to the PMS administrator. Those amounts are in addition to the normal  block grant. The Northern Ireland Executive&rsquo;s draft Budget, agreed on 15  December, contained provisions for the funding of the proposed solution, which  confirmed that the contribution from the Treasury of &pound;25 million will be  matched by an equal contribution from the Executive.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The proposed solution remains subject to Executive,  Assembly and EU agreement, as well as, of course, to agreement from those who  have put funds into the PMS.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bresland</strong>:  I thank the First Minister for his answer. Will he indicate what steps are  required before the savers will be paid?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: On the face of it, this all seems to be a very simple matter: the  Treasury agrees that, from 1 April, funds will be made available to the  Northern Ireland Executive. The Northern Ireland Executive, which have taken a  decision in principle, would have to take a formal decision on the matter. Of  course, before they can do that, they require to see the schemes that the  administrator is working up. Fortunately, in this Assembly, we have passed  legislation to deal with financial hardship, and we can bring a scheme forward  to the Executive and the Assembly under that legislation. That saves us having  to tailor-make a piece of legislation for this purpose. Obviously, European  Union approval is necessary, as, indeed, is that of the administrator and of  those who have funds in the PMS.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The bottom line is that the funds will be made available to  us from 1 April. We can probably make them available within a month of all the  necessary and detailed legal drafting and regulatory work being carried out.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  Will the First Minister explain why disqualification proceedings have been  taken against some former directors of the PMS and not others?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I could attempt to do so, but I should not, because, clearly, it  is a legal matter. It is on legal advice that the Enterprise, Trade and Investment  Minister reported, as necessary, and, as I understand it, some people have been  barred from holding directorships or the process is going ahead to consider  that matter. As to why one director was chosen as opposed to another, the Enterprise, Trade and  Investment Minister would have to answer that, but I suspect that she would be  unable to do so until any legal proceedings had passed by.</p>

    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading"><strong>Health  and Social Care Trusts</strong>: Payments to Craftsmen</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">1. <strong>Mr  Wells </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety what  is the total average annual cost of enhanced payments made to skilled craftsmen  employed by the health trusts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  850/11<a name="AQO850/11" id="AQO850/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: The total cost of  the recruitment premium paid to skilled maintenance craftsmen in health and  social care, under the Agenda for Change agreement, is &pound;899,000 in the current  year.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.00pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>:  There was a rationale for paying the enhancements when they were introduced,  because the trusts found it very difficult to recruit skilled craftsmen.  However, does the Minister realise that if he were to put an advert in the  paper for a craftsman for one of the trusts today, there would be several  hundred applications due to the downturn in the construction trade? Will he  assure the House that the enhanced payments are being reviewed, with the  possibility of making a substantial saving of, as he has outlined, almost  &pound;900,000?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The item that we are talking  about is part of the Agenda for Change national agreement that was implemented  on 1 October 2004. A huge amount of work has been done on Agenda for Change  since that date. It is not something that I can affect arbitrarily &mdash; it is a  matter for national negotiation in London.  There have been discussions in London  around its future. The Member will be aware, for example, that anyone who earns  more than &pound;21,000 is subject to a pay freeze. It is not something that I am  able to do on my own.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burns</strong>:  Will the Minister clarify exactly what a skilled craftsman is? Have all those  skilled craftsmen had their salaries enhanced under Agenda for Change?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I cannot speak for all the  craftsmen without looking at individuals, but, yes, Agenda for Change was to  look at the issue of pay and to ensure fair pay for a fair day&rsquo;s work. That has  been the ongoing process.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A skilled craftsman is a plumber, electrician, fitter or  engineer: individuals without whose skills, large units, such as hospitals,  would not be able to function. Take the recent inclement weather, for example.  Our operating theatres have ventilators that can operate in incoming  temperatures of -4&deg;C. When the temperature fell to -10&deg;C and below, those  craftsmen stayed in operating theatres all night to ensure that the  temperatures inside did not drop. If the temperature in an operating theatre  drops below -4&deg;C, the air coming in quickly freezes the ventilators, leaving  the ventilators and theatres inoperable. That is one example of the extra work  that the skilled craftsmen do.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">They are not the sort of individuals whom you can simply  recruit from an advert in the paper. However, as I come from a building background,  I am aware of the huge problems in the building business. We are talking about  &pound;899,000 for a number of individuals:  87 plumbers and 156 electricians. In effect, it concerns some 220 staff. We are  not talking about huge sums for anyone.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading"><strong>Swine  Flu</strong>: Vaccination</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">2. <strong>Mr Ross </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety to outline  his Department&rsquo;s swine flu vaccination policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  851/11<a name="AQO851/11" id="AQO851/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: During the pandemic, I launched  a swine flu vaccination programme on 21 October 2009. The programme started  with the vaccination of the clinical priority groups, which were identified by  the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) as those individuals  at greatest risk of complications if they become infected with swine flu. The  formal swine flu vaccination programme came to an end on 31 March 2010.  However, the swine flu vaccine continued to be available for those in the  at-risk groups aged six months and over, pregnant women and front line  healthcare workers until 1 October 2010 when the seasonal swine flu vaccination  programme for 2010-11 commenced.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The seasonal flu vaccine for this winter includes  protection against a swine flu strain. The swine flu and seasonal flu  vaccination policies in Northern    Ireland are based on recommendations from  the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which is an independent  expert advisory committee that advises the four UK Health Ministers.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>:  Will the Minister assure the House that the Department will have enough of the  vaccine if the swine flu situation in Northern Ireland worsens and the  Minister has to change his vaccination policy to encompass more people?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I can confirm that that is the  case. However, I point out that all the data on the incidence of flu based on  reports to GPs and to those working out of hours and on the number of people in  intensive care units appears to indicate that the peak in swine flu has passed.  The Member will be aware that a pandemic lasts around 16 weeks and comes in two  waves, which is what happened last year. However, this year, we are talking  about a standard seasonal flu season of six to eight weeks. We are now well  into that period &mdash; we are certainly past the middle of it &mdash; and it appears as  though we are past the peak. That being said, I have an adequate amount of the  flu vaccine for the population of Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  Will the Minister join me in thanking the health and social care staff who are  working tirelessly and with the upmost professionalism through the winter flu  period?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I readily do so. The Health  Service has faced a series of challenges this winter. It began with the very  inclement weather and the difficulties associated with that, some of which I  alluded to in an answer to Mr Burns. We then had the water shortage, during  which a number of hospitals went without water. However, thanks to the Fire and  Rescue Service and the ingenuity of our staff, we kept the service going. We  are now dealing with swine flu. However, as I say, we will, hopefully, be  beyond that soon. Our health and social care staff took on and did all that  work as well as their ordinary work. They obviously need to be commended, and  we need to express our gratitude for the way in which they deliver that  service.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  The Minister referred to the at-risk groups in his initial answer. Will he  provide the House with a clear definition of those who are deemed to be at  risk?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The at-risk groups for seasonal  flu include the over-65s, even if they are fit and healthy; children and adults  suffering from chronic heart conditions, chronic chest conditions, such as  asthma, chronic liver disease, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, lower immunity  due to disease or treatments, such as steroids; children who have previously been  admitted to hospital with chest infections; carers who are the main carer for  an elderly or disabled person; people who live in a residential nursing home;  people with certain neurological conditions; and all pregnant women.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Clinical Excellence Awards</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">3. <strong>Mr Weir </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety whether he  is taking any action to stop the practice of paying clinical excellence awards  to consultants.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 852/11<a name="AQO852/11" id="AQO852/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I have already taken action on  the payment of clinical excellence awards to consultants. I have decided that  no new clinical excellence awards will be made this year. I took that decision  in light of the Government&rsquo;s announcement of a two-year pay freeze for public  sector workers who earn more than &pound;21,000 per annum, the comprehensive spending  review and the financial crisis faced by the health and social care sector as a  result of budget cuts. That means that money that would have gone to new  clinical excellence awards can instead be redirected.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Together with the Health Ministers in England, Scotland  and Wales, I have  commissioned an independent review of the various clinical excellence awards in  operation across the UK.  That review is being undertaken by the review body for doctors and dentists&rsquo;  remuneration, and we have asked for its recommendations on the future of  clinical excellence awards by July 2011.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  welcome the fact that there will be no new awards. However, I think that &pound;11  million of the current budget is going towards clinical excellence awards. Will  that money be stopped and instead be put into front line services or will it  continue to be paid?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Again, those are national  agreements and are under contract. When someone makes a contract, they must  deliver it, because a deal is a deal. Those are legal contracts, and we would  risk a legal challenge if we attempted to step away from them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The amounts paid for various types of awards &mdash; some are  lower and others are higher &mdash; are being reviewed. However, I remind the House  that some of the awards are paid, not as bonuses, but as awards for particular  services to health and social care in Northern Ireland. For example, an  award was paid to the consultant responsible for the development of cancer  services throughout Northern    Ireland. That has culminated in the  development of the new Northern Ireland  cancer centre and the creation of the day treatment unit, and we now have some  of the best cancer services in the UK. Another award was paid to the  consultant responsible for the development of a renal dialysis transplant  centre that provides services to infants and children, and another was paid to  a consultant for the development of internationally recognised clinical  services and a research programme for cystic fibrosis.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Often, those awards are paid for work that is exemplary or  exceptional, or to reflect a very high standard of contribution, and they  reflect the value of a consultant&rsquo;s work. There is a core of consultants in Northern Ireland,  many of whom are at the cutting edge, internationally as well as nationally, of  clinical work.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answers so far. Is the issue not simply one of  creating openness and transparency about to whom and how awards are made,  rather than threatening to stop making awards to people who, in many or most  cases, deserve them?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I agree that, in most cases, the  awards are deserved. I am all for openness and transparency, because they help  to obviate some of the criticism. I also believe, although this is a matter for  the review body, that there are other areas to which we can look for clinical  excellence. The nurse who delivered the new cardiac service in the Omagh  hospital, for example, would be precluded from this type of clinical excellence  award, but she is exactly the sort of person who should be eligible. The system  is being reviewed, but those awards are about rewarding and recognising  exceptional personal contributions over and above the normal standard that one  would expect of a clinician.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Armstrong</strong>:  Does the Minister believe that staff morale is vital and the draft Budget will  have a negative impact on that in future?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: In my opinion, Health Service  staff do a first-class job for the population of Northern Ireland and offer a  first-class service. Morale is affected by a lot of the criticism, much of it  unfounded, which is perpetually heaped on the Health Service. I remind Members  that demand for hospital services has risen by 20% in the past three years.  Despite that increase, the same number of staff delivers that service today.  With no increase in the workforce whatsoever, they stretch to do more and to  increase productivity. However, it must be recognised that there is a limit to  how far they can stretch, and, all too often, there is no such recognition.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Western Health and Social Care Trust:  Governance Review</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">4. <strong>Mr  Gallagher </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  whether a governance review of the Western Health and Social Care Trust is  currently under way and when the outcome will be published.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 853/11<a name="AQO853/11" id="AQO853/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I have been advised that a  review of clinical and social care governance in the Western Health and Social  Care Trust was commissioned by the Health and Social Care Board. That is part  of the board&rsquo;s routine responsibilities in its role as commissioner of  services, whereby it regularly reviews the performance of health and social  care trusts. The review has now concluded, and the board is considering its  findings. I am advised that the board expects to present its findings at its  board meeting on 27 January 2011.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  The dogs in the street know that such reviews and investigations are carried  out as a result of public concerns. The Minister said that he is all for  openness and transparency. To reassure the public that the concerns identified  are being addressed, will he accept that it is important that the findings of  any such review be put into the public domain?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: As I said, the board expects to  present its findings at its meeting on 27 January 2011. Those board meetings  are always held in public.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his answer to  the original question. I also wish to record my disappointment that the Committee  for Health, Social Services and Public Safety did not hear about the review.  Once again, it was probably picked up by the media. The Minister said that it  was a regular review commissioned by the board. In light of the high-profile  cases that have been in the public domain for a while, will the Minister  confirm whether any other reviews were commissioned over the past one or two  years so that we can determine whether it is a standard, regular occurrence?</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: This is a governance review  within the trust, which I regard as standard business practice &mdash; measuring  effectiveness, determining problems and then forming an action plan. It is the  start of the way in which the new governance arrangements are working in health  and social care. There will be many more reviews, and the board plans shortly  to look at A&amp;E performances, for example, in exactly the same way. We could  report everything that the board is doing, but Members would need lorry loads  of paper to get all those reports.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The review is part of normal governance. Members are aware  that I have radically altered the way in which health and social care is  delivered in Northern    Ireland. I remind Ms Ramsey that I am the  only Minister to deliver on the review of public administration (RPA). It is a  change and a departure. The board has performance management and improvement  functions, which were retained in the Department until I became Minister. I  moved those out with other powers and I streamlined the board. I expect to see  that performance management and improvement being effective in the years to  come.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  Further to the answer that the Minister gave to the Member for Fermanagh and  South Tyrone, will he ensure that, after the governance review is adjudicated  on internally this week, he and public representatives, as well as the wider  public, will have the opportunity to analyse that review to see where it takes  the wider community beyond January 2011?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: As I said, the board expects to  get the findings presented to it at a public meeting on 27 January 2011. People  will be able to obtain the information and have a look at it, but the process  is ongoing in certain areas. I expect such reviews to be a constant discipline  in the Health Service, emanating from the board as it oversees the  effectiveness of our trusts and other areas.</p>

    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">5. <strong>Mr Frew </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety for an  update on the refurbishment of Cherry Tree House and Allen ward at the Royal Belfast   Hospital for Sick  Children.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 854/11<a name="AQO854/11" id="AQO854/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The Belfast Health and Social  Care Trust has advised that work on the administrative area in the Allen ward  is complete and that, following further consultation with patient  representatives and staff, plans for the clinical area were revised. I have  been advised that refurbishment work on the clinical area has commenced and is  expected to last approximately eight weeks. The refurbishment is costing  &pound;300,000 and, once complete, it will greatly improve accommodation for  patients, parents and staff.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Frew</strong>:  Given recent history and controversy, will the Minister reassure the people and  families who need and use Cherry Tree House that the facilities will be of the  highest standards, which they are used to, and that those facilities will be  enhanced?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The trust is spending a  substantial amount of money on doing exactly that by refurbishing the Allen  ward. The Member will be aware that Cherry Tree House is at one end of the  Allen ward and is very much part of it. Therefore, as I have indicated, it will  be refurbished.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s answer about  Cherry Tree House and the Allen ward. A number of my constituents who go to Daisy Hill   Hospital are referred to  regional services such as neurology and cystic fibrosis. Will the Minister give  any assurance that the Belfast Trust will not be allowed to make unilateral  decisions on the provision of regional services?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The Belfast Trust is responsible  for providing the regional service. It has done and continues to do so. We are  talking about refurbishing the building in which that service is delivered. The  building is the Allen ward, although a part of it at one end was originally  built with the help of public donations to house adult cystic fibrosis. That  service was moved to the Belfast   City Hospital  a number of years ago. That vacated area of the building is now used as part of  the general Allen ward, and it will benefit from the refurbishment. The  building will help to enhance the services.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: I  wrote to the trust about the Allen ward and I am very pleased to hear about the  coming enhancement. Will the Minister assure us that, during the eight weeks of  renovation, patients will be given proper protection? They need isolated beds  because they are prone to picking up infections.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Naturally, I can give the  assurance that the service and benefits to patients and their safety are  uppermost in the trust&rsquo;s plans, which accommodate not just cystic fibrosis  patients but all the other children&rsquo;s conditions with which the Allen ward  deals.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>:  Is the Minister aware of the distress caused to the children and families  attending in Cherry Tree House and the Allen ward by the manner in which the  proposal was brought forward to the construction phase? In addition, what steps  does he intend to take to ensure that there is better consultation with parents  in future, with them properly notified of major decisions that will affect the  treatment and care of their children?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Uppermost in parents&rsquo; minds and,  indeed, the minds of clinicians and the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust,  is the service that is delivered to children in the Allen ward and to those  with cystic fibrosis. When one looks at the success achieved on life expectancy  for those children, one can see how the delivery of that service has improved  greatly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Of course, as I am sure the Member is aware, cystic  fibrosis is not the only condition that is addressed in the Allen ward, part of  which, at one end, is called Cherry Tree House, which, as I said, was  originally used to treat adults with cystic fibrosis. Although part of the  Allen ward, Cherry Tree House&rsquo;s distance from the nurses&rsquo; station does not make  it appropriate for all patients. I expect those who deliver services to consult  regular users properly, and parents of children with cystic fibrosis will  expect to be at the Allen ward routinely. In addition, I expect the trusts to  consult. The Belfast Trust consulted in November and January. We have a way  forward, and work is ongoing.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Swine Flu</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">6. <strong>Mr  Sheehan </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety for  his assessment of the current swine flu situation. (AQO 855/11<a name="AQO855/11" id="AQO855/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The most recent figures, for the  period 8 January to 14 January 2011, show that the main markers for the level  of flu here &mdash; new cases and GP consultation rates &mdash; have decreased  significantly. There were only 85 new laboratory-confirmed cases of swine flu  in Northern Ireland  last week, compared to 219 in the first week of January 2011. If the current  trend continues, the peak of this year&rsquo;s flu season has passed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As of Wednesday 19 January 2011, 21 people from Northern Ireland  had died from H1N1 flu during the current flu season. Of those, 18 had  underlying medical conditions, two did not, and one has still to be confirmed.  Unfortunately, those deaths are a reminder of the fact that, for a small number  of people, particularly those with underlying medical conditions, swine flu can  be a very serious illness.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The World Health Organization said that there is no  evidence that the swine flu virus is changing. The advice that I have is that  the current pattern of swine flu here is no different to that in other parts of  the UK.  For the majority of people, flu remains a mild, self-limiting illness that can  be treated at home.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Sheehan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his answer.  During the current swine flu outbreak, there have been 21 deaths, which is two  more than last year. Does the Minister believe that there is an issue with  public confidence here, and should he not make a statement to the House in  order to restore public confidence?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I did exactly that this day last  week in response to a question from the Member&rsquo;s colleague sitting to his left.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As far as swine flu is concerned, we have been assiduous in  providing information to the public, doing so in a variety of ways, including  through a large number of statements and press releases from the Public Health  Agency, the Department and the Chief Medical Officer. In addition, we publish a  weekly flu bulletin setting out the current position. Vaccination uptake rates  demonstrate that the information that we put out has been listened to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To underpin the situation that we are in now, the number of  adults in ICUs is falling off, and there is one patient still in a paediatric  ICU. That is the extent of it, and we are quite encouraged. The advice that I  have received is that swine flu has passed its peak.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: I  want to ask the Minister about the lack of information, which may or may not be  spreading unnecessary panic. I set that in the context that I asked a question  in the House about how many confirmed and suspected cases of swine flu were  being dealt with by the Ulster   Hospital. I asked that  question last Monday and was meant to have an answer on Thursday. I still have  no answer and no explanation. How can the Minister explain that lack of  information to the public?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: As the current outbreak is not a  pandemic but an epidemic, we revert to normal reporting procedures. We look  primarily at regional trends rather than at individual hospitals. If I offered  to give that information and it has not been forthcoming, I will ensure that it  is and will apologise. I do not remember.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member asked what information we have given out. Since  1 October 2010, when the flu vaccination campaign was launched, the Department,  the Chief Medical Officer and the Public Health Agency have issued a series of  press releases to inform the Health Service and the public. We have also  published a weekly flu bulletin and issued information through Northern Ireland  Direct. The fact that that has been heard and listened to is demonstrated by  the fact that our vaccination numbers stood at just under 300,000 at the end of  November and were up to 330,000 at the end of December. The number of  vaccinations among the at-risk groups is, therefore, somewhere around 350,000.  That demonstrates a very good rate of uptake against our anticipated uptake  target of around 350,000. That shows that the public are aware of the  information and that we are getting the message out.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  Can the Minister inform the House whether he has kept in contact with the other  regions of the UK  about swine flu and, if so, how regularly?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I have kept in contact not  simply with other regions of the UK,  but with the Irish   Republic. That has been  done directly through Ministers and on a routine basis by the Chief Medical  Officer and deputy chief medical officers. We began in mid-December with a  morning teleconference encompassing the entire Health Service in Northern Ireland.  That operated every morning apart from Christmas Day, and we looked at  emergency planning and the effect that the weather, the water shortage and the  interruptions to the water supply were having on the Health Service and the  delivery of the flu vaccine. The Health Service has demonstrated that it has  coped extremely well, bearing in mind the winter pressures, the water problems  and swine flu.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  Given the great tragedy that several of the recent deaths from swine flu have  been residents of the Republic who took advantage of the cross-border emergency  services, ended up in hospital here and, sadly, passed away, what recent  conversations has the Minister had with the Minister for Health and Children in  the South about deepening co-operation on epidemic and pandemic responses?  Indeed, can he inform the House whether he has had the opportunity to make  contact with the new Minister for Health and Children in the Republic of Ireland?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I have not had contact with the  new Minister, but I had regular contact with the previous Minister. Clearly, we  have a shared agenda on swine flu vaccination programmes, and so on. The Health  Department in the Irish   Republic has its own  independent committee on vaccination and its own independent experts who  provide advice. The advice that it has received is exactly the same as the  advice that the four UK Departments have received, and we have adopted a common  approach.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading"><strong>DHSSPS</strong>:  Savings</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">7. <strong>Mr Lunn </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety for an  update on his Department&rsquo;s draft savings delivery plan for 2011-15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 856/11<a name="AQO856/11" id="AQO856/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I have been given a budget of  &pound;4&middot;6 billion, which is well below what I require to maintain existing services.  With a budget of, perhaps, &pound;4&middot;8 billion, it would have been possible to prepare  a realistic savings plan, but a &pound;4&middot;6 billion budget changes savings to cuts.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The Health Service delivers hundreds of services in  hundreds of settings, so working through the implications of this meagre budget  will take time, but it is clear that, if things do not change, it will be a  cuts plan not a savings plan.</p>

    <p class="OralAnswers-H1Heading"><a name="j"></a>Question for Urgent Oral Answer</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H2DepartmentHeading">Health, Social Services and Public  Safety</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Swine Flu</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong> asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, following the  figures produced by the Public Health Agency which show that the number of  deaths from swine flu is continuing to rise and that there are now 21 deaths  compared with a total of 19 last year, can he provide an assurance that the  Health Service is able to cope with the demand.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: Our thoughts must  be with the families who have been bereaved, including those who have,  tragically, lost young children. Although flu is still circulating in the  community, the number of cases is decreasing. The Health Service continues to  be busy with flu and seasonal winter pressures, but those pressures are being  managed effectively across Northern    Ireland, and normal escalation arrangements  have been in place to cope with any expected demands at this time. A&amp;E  departments are busy but continue to be fully operational, and primary care  services also report that they are busy but are coping well. The measures that  were agreed to provide for the expansion of critical care capacity have been  successful in enabling trusts to ensure that anyone who needs critical care has  got it. I pay tribute to staff, who have been treating people with flu at what  is always a very busy period.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his answer.  He did not make a statement here last week; I had to ask a question for urgent  oral answer to get information. This week, with an increasing number of deaths  associated with swine flu, I have had to put in another question for urgent  oral answer.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister accept that there is a lack of  information? I take on board the fact that a bulletin goes out from the Public  Health Agency, but, to the ordinary person on the street, there is a lack of  information outside the usual rumour mill. There is concern and panic, because  people are being told that supplies of the vaccine for swine flu and even of  the seasonal flu jab are running out. Can we cope? Do we have enough vaccines  outside the seasonal flu jab? I appeal to the Minister, on the back of 21  deaths, to come to the Assembly next Monday and make a further statement so  that we, as elected representatives, can get the proper message out and deal  with the rumour mill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I will comment on a few of those  points. First, there were 19 deaths last year, and there have been 21 deaths  this year. I remind the House that, last year, the peaks were in the summer and  autumn and that, this year, the peak has been in the middle of winter &mdash; a hard,  severe winter &mdash; and winter has an effect. I am advised that the difference between  the two years is not, primarily, a result of anything other than the winter,  which is very hard on people who have flu and certain underlying conditions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said earlier, we have large numbers of vaccines. I  have ensured that we have enough to vaccinate the entire at-risk population. We  also have a swine flu vaccine, which we have used to supplement the supply  chain, although seasonal flu vaccines are still circulating in some doctors&rsquo;  surgeries.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On the point about information, there is nothing worse than  people who will not hear or who will not listen. I have issued release after  release after release; the Public Health Agency has issued about 16 releases,  and the Chief Medical Officer has done likewise; we have circulated information  around the entire Health Service, and all doctors&rsquo; surgeries carry the  information; there is the weekly flu bulletin; and we use Northern Ireland  Direct. Of course, primary care trusts contact those who are eligible for the  flu vaccine. At the end of November, 300,000 people had been vaccinated in a  programme that started on 1 October. Therefore large numbers of people hear the  information, and, by the end of December, 330,000 people had been vaccinated.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member is right  to say that certain scaremongering messages have been circulating: that the  virus has changed, that it is different from the one circulating in England,  that it is affecting healthy adults in particular and so on. We have to work  harder to counter that scaremongering. However, I assure you that all the  information and advice that I have been given is that this is the same virus  that is circulating in England  and that it is the same virus as last year. We have adequate vaccines and  antivirals to deal with it, and we have escalation plans in place to expand  critical care as we require it. The number of beds and the number of patients  with flu in critical care is down by about 50% from two weeks ago. Therefore,  all the indications are that we are past the peak.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The key information that the public need is the key  information that I have determined to get across. It comes from clinicians, who  hear routinely from the Chief Medical Officer, from the Public Health Agency,  from doctors, from GPs, from the BMA and from the Critical Care Network. They  are all talking, and everyone can take comfort from the fact that the Health  Service is prepared for it and is delivering on it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr Wells)</strong>:  Having looked at the statistics for children under five, I accept that the  Public Health Agency has made the right decision in not having a blanket  vaccination programme. The issue here is not so much the way in which the  authorities are dealing with the case but the message that they are sending out  to the public. There are two areas where that could be improved. First, we need  an assurance from the Minister that any further cases of children under five  dying from swine flu will be made immediately public rather than waiting until  the Thursday bulletin. Secondly, I have become aware that some of those who  have sadly passed on died with swine flu rather than because of it. The  authorities are taking a precautionary approach in that, if a patient who  passes on had swine flu, it is notified in the statistics, even though swine  flu may not have led to their demise. Is there any way that the Minister can  provide the public with more information on that aspect? Can he give me an  assurance in respect of children under five in any future announcements?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: It would help if politicians  delivered the message that the Public Health Agency, the Chief Medical Officer  and the Department are giving: the virus is no different from the one in England, it is not separate from the one  circulating in England,  and it is not attacking healthy adults in particular. That would be a big help  in not spreading alarm among the public.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Last year, there was a departure from the way of reporting  deaths because it was a pandemic, but, this year, it is an epidemic. Therefore,  throughout the UK and the Irish Republic,  we returned to the previous method because of the panic after Christmas. We are  now reporting the death of children under the age of five, and we are reporting  the same as we did with the pandemic.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As far as the issue of people dying with swine flu is  concerned, the Member did not say where that information came from, but I will  certainly check it out. However, the coroner makes that judgement, and we must  wait for what the coroner has to say.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Every year, about 400 people in Northern Ireland die from  flu-related illness. It is extremely sad that that happens, and that is why we  vaccinate. The scaremongering this year has been profoundly unhelpful. I shall  give the House an indication of exactly what is happening: it was expected that  vaccination would be completed by December, but deliveries went out to  practices, and there was a sudden, unprecedented demand for vaccines in  January. That was a direct result of public alarm. However, we have been able  to meet that demand, and I can supplement that with the swine flu vaccine.  However, everybody has to be more deliberate in their public pronouncements.</p>
    <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="k"></a>Private Members&rsquo; Business</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Post-primary Transfer Advice</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Debate resumed on motion:</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly notes with concern the restrictions placed  by the Department of Education on primary-school principals and teachers who  wish to advise parents and pupils on post-primary transfer matters following  the issue of post-primary test results; and calls on the Minister of Education  to review her decision. &mdash; [Mr Craig.]</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Givan</strong>: I  declare an interest as a member of the boards of governors of two primary  schools in my constituency. The issue is close to my heart because of its  impact on children and young people in those schools, in particular, and in  schools throughout my constituency.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the foreword to the circular that was issued by the  Minister, she says:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;I am aware that many principals are unhappy about  being placed in a difficult position by the actions of grammar schools  operating breakaway entrance tests.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I have to say that my experience of dealing with  school principals in different sectors has been their unease and discontent at  the actions of the Minister of Education. Her actions have caused them to be  concerned at how matters are handled by the Department. The circular goes on to  say that building an equitable system for post-primary transfer is key to the  Minister.</p>
    <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Molloy] in the Chair)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: I  thank the Member for giving way. Does he consider that there is anything  equitable when children who, in many cases, are from low socio-economic groups  are not given proper information and advice from their school principal as to  what is in their best interests? Is that not the politics of educational spite?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Givan</strong>: I  thank the Member for his intervention. He makes a valid point. If the  Minister&rsquo;s intent is to have an equitable system and to tackle disadvantage,  her actions have, in fact, been to the greatest detriment of the children whom  she and her party claim to want to help most. Children in an affluent position,  who receive support from their parents and those around them, will be able to  get through the system. They will able to get the help and assistance that they  require. However, children from a disadvantaged background will not be able to  access that same opportunity. Her actions have, in fact, been to the detriment  of those whom she claims to want to help most.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The circular is rather pedantic. It highlights the failures  not only of the Minister but of her party. It represents the failure of that  party&rsquo;s agenda for education. It has not been able to do away with academic  selection or to impose its Marxist ideology on the education system. The  Minister has been prevented from that by my party in the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On 5 May 2011, my party will go forward into the election.  It will be able to state clearly that, because of its action through the  Assembly, Caitr&iacute;ona Ruane, the Minister of Education, did not get her way. She  can go to her electorate and explain why she has been unable to implement Sinn  F&eacute;in&rsquo;s policy. Perhaps, she has already drafted a letter of apology to her  mentor, Mr Adams, who has now run away across the border.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Givan</strong>:  No, I will not give way.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Perhaps, the Minister will get 100 lines from her mentor,  which will be &ldquo;I must do better&rdquo;. The Minister will never be able to do better,  however, and take forward her party&rsquo;s agenda because my party will be able to  stop her.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My conversations with principals and those who are involved  in education across the controlled and maintained sectors has revealed to me  that the Minister has, in fact, succeeded in attaining consensus. The one area  in which she has successfully attained consensus is disdain for how she has  managed the Department of Education.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Ultimately, boards of governors in schools in the  controlled and maintained sectors have the power to carry out the education  system. Academic selection is enshrined in legislation. I am not someone who  advocates the 11-plus &mdash; far from it. I am the product of the secondary school  system. I sat the test. I went to my local secondary school, not to a grammar  school. Believe me: I am not here as a defender of grammar schools; I am here  as a defender of parental choice, which the Minister and her party want to deny  people. She needs to learn.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the Assembly moves into its next term, we want to create  consensus on the education system and to ensure that the Department is not  mismanaged and that the Minister does not mismanage it. We will take that  forward.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Does the Member concur with a comment that was made in a letter to the  Education Minister from the GBA, which is a reputable organisation that  represents 42% of post-primary schools? It states:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;We believe your invitation is yet another attempt to  intimidate schools with speculative legal threats. The GBA regrets having to  resort to legal advice, but given the combative nature of your stewardship, we  must provide the leadership that our members demand.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is what people think of the Minister, and that  is an organisation for which the Minister will, no doubt, show disdain.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Givan</strong>: I  thank the Member for his intervention. That quotation came not from him but  from an organisation involved in the education system. Despite the best efforts  of the Minister and her party to dismantle our education system, they have  failed miserably. We take some credit for having prevented her from doing that,  but we did not come into the Chamber to try to prevent the Minister from  creating a system. We are willing to work with the Minister and the party  opposite to create a system that all of us can agree to and establish consensus  around.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Bring your remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Givan</strong>:  However, we will not stand for a Minister who has sought to have chaos and  crisis in our education system.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Givan</strong>: We  prevented her from doing that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I am almost tired of this debate. I had hoped to speak before Question Time,  since, unfortunately, the debate was brought forward. I was down listening to  Declan Kelly talking about the message that he puts out to American investors.  He heaped praise on the Executive and a number of Ministers and talked about  the plans that they have put in place. He said that the most important thing  that investors look at is our young people, the quality of them and their  education. He said that they are good people and that people want to do  business with them. Mr Kelly&rsquo;s presentation was, as ever, fast, inspirational  in places and definitely uplifting. However he challenged us to do more, better  and faster, and to look at what is happening to us now as an opportunity and  not some form of obstacle.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I mention that because, when we get into this debate, I  hear the party opposite talk about trying to rid the world of discrimination or  inequalities, and they talk about something being fundamentally immoral. That  seems to be hyperbole. These discussions do come across not as great debates in  which we argue over points of principle but as petty-minded, vindictive and  obstructionist and as an argument about something that is not moving forward in  the way that people want it to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a debate to be had. There is no solution that fits  all, and there are other points of view. I, like others who have spoken, will  take those points of view on board. The most distressing thing that I hear from  educationalists is the plea to put the children first. Surely, that should be  at the root of all the things that we do. I do not believe that the nit-picking  and ping-pong politics that we are playing serves anyone&rsquo;s aspirations. I  certainly do not see how it puts our children first.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">People talk about going to the electorate, as we will do  shortly. We will talk about our contribution to the great education debate, but  I do not think that any of us will be given a gold star. I do not think that  the people of Northern    Ireland will look at us and tell us that we  have resolved the issue well. They look at us and say that they cannot believe  that we have been up here for four years and have not resolved anything.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a message that we try to put across. In the past  number of months, years even, I have tried to put across that message. Like  other Members who have spoken, I used to use the up-and-at-them approach and  shout across the Chamber. We wanted to make our point of view passionately and  courageously, but it got us nowhere. If there is no reciprocation, no willingness  to find a solution and no acceptance that we have to build consensus and to  work together, we will not find a solution. That is to the detriment of our  children.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister came forward with a number of issues on which  we tried to get a resolution. When we had the all-party group &mdash; the  all-party-minus-Sinn-F&eacute;in group &mdash; we talked about a large number of issues.  There were many issues that we could agree on. We could talk about early years.  We could even talk about the age at which education commences. We could look at  the trials of the transfer from nursery to primary education, primary to  secondary education or further on. We could look at all those things, but only  when we engaged in a proper way.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have to say to you, Minister, that I do not know why you  put so much energy into those issues, which are divisive, non-constructive and  non-reconstructed. There is a better way. You should show leadership. You  should show the people of Northern    Ireland &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Speak through the Chair.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  &mdash; and the politicians in this House that you are capable of leading. To date,  you have failed, and the people will judge you harshly at the next election.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education (Ms Ruane)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I  listened with interest to the debate and want to begin by reassuring the  Assembly that, as Education Minister, the interests of all primary-school  principals, teachers, pupils and their parents are of paramount importance to  me. Can that be said of those who tabled the motion, or are they seeking to  uphold the interests of a small minority of schools that are insisting on  retaining an outdated and discredited system for their own perceived interests  and are seeking to draw in primary-school principals as unwilling participants  in their breakaway arrangements?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo, mar tugann s&iacute;  deis dom a thabhairt chun solais an neamhaird ioml&aacute;n at&aacute; na scoileanna gramada&iacute;  ag d&eacute;anamh den &eacute;ifeacht at&aacute; ag a gcuid gn&iacute;omhartha&iacute; ar an earn&aacute;il oideachais i  gcoitinne. I welcome the debate, as it allows me to expose the total disregard  for the impact that the actions of grammar schools have on the wider education  sector. Those who tabled the motion appear to have missed the point. The  Department of Education&rsquo;s policy is that there is no necessity to set a test in  order to select or reject children for admission to post-primary schools. That  is in line with education policy right across the world. A transfer test is no  longer a feature of the official transfer procedure. Therefore, advice on  breakaway entrance tests is not a feature of the transfer procedure. Such  advice can be provided only by those continuing to operate the unnecessary and  unjustified tests against the advice of my Department.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is unfortunate that the DUP will not adhere to its own  manifesto for the 1989 local government elections &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. I have said before, and the Speaker has made it very clear,  that Members should not have exchanges across the Chamber from a sedentary  position. I ask the Member to respect that. The Minister has the Floor.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. It is unfortunate  that the DUP does not adhere to that manifesto, which states:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;We believe that selection at 11 should be ended. The  11-plus procedure is educationally unsound and socially divisive and places  unnecessary strain upon children at a very early age.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText"><span class="Italic">&mdash; [Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Some people said today that I should be worried about going back  to my electorate. I have absolutely no concerns about doing that, and neither  does any member of this party. Sinn F&eacute;in takes clear principled positions, and  we adhere to promises that we made to the electorate. We did not cave in to  pressures from certain interests. It would be very interesting for the DUP to  tell the House when it changed its policy and who was part of changing that  policy. Does policy just get made willy-nilly then changed, with no one being  informed about it? Or perhaps it is only a couple of people who make those  changes. The saddest thing of all is that they do not even tell the party  membership what happens and why they have changed policy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We heard Jonathan Bell talking about Einstein. Well, he  made the case better than I could. When I came into office in 2007, there were  12,000 young people leaving the education system without minimum requirements.  What would Einstein tell us? Change it; it ain&rsquo;t working. Maybe Jonathan should  go back to read Einstein again.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In truth, state-sponsored academic selection was academic  rejection for the majority of our children. Who can credibly defend or be part  of a system that condemns the majority of our children as failures? We must  reject absolutely and irreversibly the notion that any child is a failure. I  encourage everyone involved in the education of our children to adopt modern  approaches.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My policy of transfer without academic selection enjoys  overwhelming support among educationalists, particularly those in the primary  sector. For too long, the primary sector has been the poor relation of the  post-primary sector, having been forced to spend a considerable proportion of  its time, against its will, preparing children for an unnecessary test. Primary  schools are delighted that they can now concentrate on ensuring that every  child has a quality educational experience throughout their primary school  career.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I held meetings with primary-school principals in every  education and library board area. They came in their droves and told me to get  rid of the test, because it discriminates against children and should not be  happening. Let me be clear about the change that I have introduced for transfer  2011: my Department will fund and actively support primary schools to provide  advice to parents on the transfer procedure, as long as that occurs before the  results of breakaway entrance tests on 5 February 2011. As my Department wishes  to fund and support all such help, it has advised all primary schools to  provide that assistance to all parents before that date. The Department will  not fund or support any meetings on or after that date, as they may focus on  advice relating to breakaway test results. I could not reasonably be expected  to fund any function that supported the operation of breakaway tests which  statutory guidance that my Department issued strongly recommends should not be  used. Therefore, schools can continue to provide funded transfer interviews for  all parents if they take place before 4 February 2011.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP has got it wrong again. It is trying to ride two  horses. It pretends that it is opposed to academic selection, yet it supports  every mechanism in place. Indeed, people who support academic selection give  succour to that party&rsquo;s position all the time. That is just part and parcel of  its process, and it is unfortunate that it continues to do that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The majority of children moving from primary to  post-primary school are not seeking places in schools that use breakaway  entrance tests. For the majority of parents, advice relating to those tests is  not an issue. Therefore, the timing of that advice is not an issue. What is an  issue is the stress that many primary-school principals experience when faced  with pressure from some parents to provide advice on tests in which they had no  involvement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Is c&uacute;iseanna imn&iacute; iad seo a chuala m&eacute; ag pr&iacute;omhoid&iacute;  bunscoile agus ag na ceardchumainn mh&uacute;inteoireachta a raibh mo chabhair ag  teast&aacute;il uathu le taca&iacute;ocht agus cosaint a thabhairt do na pr&iacute;omhoid&iacute; sin agus  d&rsquo;fhoireann eile sna bunscoileanna. I heard those concerns voiced by not only  primary-school principals but teaching unions that wanted my help to support  and protect those principals and other staff in primary schools.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Just last week, Radio Ulster carried a report about a group  of 40 primary and secondary school principals in the Dungannon and Cookstown  area who wrote to Cardinal Brady to express their frustration at Catholic  grammar schools continuing to use breakaway tests, despite the statement from  Catholic bishops that those tests should be phased out. Those schools were  joined by many others from different sectors across the North over the past  number of years. We must listen to those schools, their teachers, pupils and  parents, as well as to many more schools like them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Parents seeking advice on breakaway tests want an  assessment of their child&rsquo;s chances of being selected or rejected by a  particular school in the light of their test results or an assessment of  whether the test result is an accurate reflection of their child&rsquo;s ability. How  can primary-school principals do that? It is unfair and unreasonable to expect them  to provide such assessments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the past &mdash; it is in the past &mdash; when there was a  state-sponsored test, primary schools were fully engaged in the delivery of  that system, and transfer booklets carried information about the grades  achieved by pupils who were admitted to schools that selected or rejected  children on the basis of perceived ability in the three years previous to that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That information enabled primary-school principals  to provide appropriate advice to parents about the implications of 11-plus  results. In case the Members opposite do not understand, let me reiterate:  there is no 11-plus. It has gone forever. Agus t&aacute; m&eacute; f&iacute;orbhu&iacute;och gurb &eacute; sin an  c&aacute;s.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Primary schools have no involvement in the operation of  breakaway tests. Transfer booklets no longer contain any information about the  grade profiles of those admitted to schools that operate their own tests  against departmental guidance. In those circumstances, primary-school  principals do not have the knowledge or the information necessary to provide  any advice on those tests even if they want to. In fact, last year, we saw that  some principals who sought to provide advice to the best of their ability were  blamed by parents if it did not result in a favourable outcome for their  children. That was totally unfair. Those principals were placed in a very  difficult position by grammar schools that were determined to follow their own  agenda. Primary schools should not be held accountable by parents for the  arrangements that are put in place by grammar schools, particularly in  circumstances where grammar schools have deliberately ignored advice from my  Department. My clear message to primary schools today is to keep doing the good  work that they are doing. The years that children spend in those schools are  some of the most important in their lives.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Last year, I issued clear instructions to grammar schools  that if they chose to go against my Department&rsquo;s guidance, any processes that  they developed should ascribe no role to primary schools. I was determined  that, this year, primary-school principals would not be put in a position where  they feel that they should be giving advice to parents against their better  judgement. So, I decided to only provide funding for transfer interviews that  take place before test results are issued. That will enable those meetings to  focus on the advice and help that primary-school principals are in a position  to provide, not on advice and guidance on tests in which they have no role.  Those tests are the sole responsibility of grammar schools.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Given the unreasonable behaviour of grammar schools, it is  necessary for me to take action to protect primary-school principals from  unjustified pressure. Through the annual admissions circular, my Department  advised all schools about that change and the reason for its introduction,  which is so that transfer interviews do not involve issues that are related to  breakaway entrance tests.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department also published a leaflet for parents that  set out the advice that had been given to schools so that parents would know  what they could expect from the transfer interview. That leaflet advised  parents to contact the relevant grammar school if they had queries about how a  test result would inform the completion of a transfer form.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If grammar schools had been reasonable and responsible in  the development of their breakaway arrangements, I would not have had to take  action to support primary-school principals. However, the grammar schools  demonstrated a total disregard for their colleagues in the primary-school sector.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The change that I introduced this year will allow all  primary-school principals to provide all parents, not just some, with the sort  of advice and support that is appropriate to enable parents to complete the  transfer form. They can discuss their child&rsquo;s progress at primary school and  the post-primary schools that might best suit that child. What they cannot  discuss in meetings funded by DE are the implications of a test result. As I  have highlighted, primary-school principals are not in a position to provide  that sort of information. Specific queries can be sent to the grammar schools  that are operating the breakaway tests.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In my foreword to the transfer 2011 admissions circular, I  noted the need to generate savings in the education budget. That may preclude  funding for any transfer interviews next year for transfer 2012. Although the  transfer interview has long been a feature of the transfer procedure, it is a  very resource-intensive mechanism for providing advice to parents on the  completion of a transfer form. It is essential that we use wisely the resources  provided to us in education.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have, therefore, included in my budget plans a proposal  to stop completely the provision of substitute teacher cover for transfer  interviews from transfer 2012. An equality impact assessment has been completed  and will be published for consultation. In that regard, my Department has  suggested a number of ways in which appropriate advice can be provided to  parents, particularly those who may need additional support, without the need  for funded transfer interviews.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I make no apologies for being against academic selection,  nor do I make any apologies for ensuring that there is no 11-plus. I believe  that all our children have individual strengths, abilities and talents, which  need to be encouraged and developed. All children must be cherished equally.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, I stand by my decision to change the  arrangements for transfer interviews this year as an action that is justified  by the need to protect primary schools. I ask grammar schools to recognise the  burden that they place on primary schools when they seek to involve them in any  aspect of the breakaway arrangements. I and my party are very proud of the fact  that we have led from the front. We have taken principled decisions and, unlike  other parties, we have not abandoned previous manifestos.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  I am grateful to my colleague Jonathan Craig for proposing the motion.  Predictably, I agree with my colleague Mervyn Storey: the issue is yet another  example of the guerrilla tactics that have been adopted by a desperate Minister  who is incapable of persuading others of the merits of her agenda through  democratic means.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although every other party in the Chamber has agreed, at  the very least, to a temporary Department of Education sponsored test, the  Minister and her party continue to plough a lone furrow of intransigent  opposition. To set a deadline for school transfer interviews the day before the  results of the transfer tests are issued is not even the politics of the schoolyard.  It is the politics of the kindergarten. It is as if the Minister has decided  that because the other kids do not play nice, she will take the ball home with  her.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The unfortunate thing about the whole situation is that no  account has been given to the impact of the Minister&rsquo;s actions on children and  parents as she continues on her dogmatic path. I previously described the  Minister&rsquo;s actions as a jihad: with each passing decision, it becomes more and  more evident that she is pursuing her goals with the vigour of a convert,  ignoring the rights and wrongs of a given situation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It has been rehearsed many times before in the Chamber  that, because of the excellent results obtained in grammar schools in Northern Ireland,  it is quite understandable that parents would want their children to attend  such schools. The Minister is seeking to punish those parents for wanting the  best for their children. To force parents to go to transfer interviews before  they are aware of their children&rsquo;s test results is like someone going to the  doctor to get advice, only for the doctor to tell the patient that he could  advise them for sure the following day when the test results have come through,  but, in the meantime, because he is not allowed to give that advice, the patient  is at liberty to flick through a dictionary or go on Google.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is one thing to preclude teachers from advising on a  test, but to block vital advice from being given to parents when they are not  in the possession of all the information makes such interviews utterly  pointless and a waste of time, effort and money. The Minister has already  forced children to sit tests outside the familiar surroundings of their own  schools. Her actions have resulted in children having to sit up to five  examination papers. She has already made it more expensive for hard-working  parents to send their children to prep schools. She issues guidance after  guidance, imposing more restrictions on schools and making increasing threats  against principals. The Minister is clearly fighting a war, but it needs to be  made clear to her that the casualties of that war are no longer simply our  children&rsquo;s futures, which she has callously disregarded up to now, but also our  children&rsquo;s emotional well-being.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It was not enough that she created instability and  uncertainty around the transfer test with her dithering, nor was it enough that  the threat of closure that hung over Northern Ireland&rsquo;s prep schools  caused untold distress for the children at those schools. It is not enough  that, time and again, the Minister leaves decisions to the last minute in the  hope that there will be insufficient time to challenge them, resulting in  uproar, confusion and, of course, a mess. That is no way to run a Department  and it is certainly no way to treat our children. What has the Minister done  this time? Again, she has issued controversial guidance in order to cause  maximum anxiety and uncertainty.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In proposing the motion, my colleague Jonathan Craig  described the Minister&rsquo;s tactics as bullying parents. I agree, but can we  expect anything else from this Minister &mdash; a Minister who often speaks about  consensus &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I accept that colourful language can be  used during the to and fro of debate. However, Miss McIlveen has accused the  Minister of bullying and issuing threats to principals. I ask the Office of the  Speaker to look at the use of that language in the debate.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: As the debate goes on, it turns out to be milder than we may have  expected in the normal cut and thrust of remarks. I have asked Members to  moderate their language, and they have ignored that. They are not ignoring me,  as an individual; they are ignoring the Chair and the institution of which they  are all a part. They can continue to do that, and it will bring down the whole  House. Members are conversing while their party representatives are speaking,  and that, too, is disrespectful. We need a wee bit more respect. I will refer  the remarks to the Speaker. We have come to recognise that this is the tone of  education debates. It does the image of the House no good.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms McIlveen</strong>:  I turn now to comments from Members.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is interesting, although not surprising, that Mr O&rsquo;Dowd  defends his Minister&rsquo;s position, but he also looks for a hidden agenda. This party  has always been open in its opposition to what the party opposite has tried to  do in dismantling the education system of Northern Ireland to the detriment  of all of us. Mr O&rsquo;Dowd claims that the motion is about protecting the grammar  schools and the elite. In doing so, he implies a minority. That is hardly the  case as 42% of post-primary children go to grammar schools and 13,000 sit the  transfer test. Mr O&rsquo;Dowd asked why the matter was taken to St   Andrews, and my colleague answered him. The answer is that we knew  that Sinn F&eacute;in would try to damage the education system, and we needed to  secure its protection.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mrs O&rsquo;Neill believes that the circular, and the role of the  principals, are clear. They are, but they do not make the actions of the  Minister, or what is contained in the guidance, acceptable. Mrs O&rsquo;Neill says  that she does not see the restrictions in the document. I hope that she has  listened to what has been said in the debate and appreciates the problems. She  said that the principals asked for the clarification. If that is the case, how  come many of them choose to ignore this guidance, just as they have ignored the  Minister&rsquo;s guidance in the past?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Such guidance creates a two-tier advice system, never mind  the two-tier education system that Mrs O&rsquo;Neill says she cannot support.  Nevertheless, I am pleased that so many Members have spoken in support of the  motion, and for a variety of reasons.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Dominic Bradley, not a supporter of academic selection,  raised concerns about the legal basis of the document and whether we should be  asking principals to abide by it. I agree with his description of it as an  assault on the professionalism of head teachers and an attempt to micromanage  experienced professionals. Micromanaging appears to be the modus operandi of Sinn  F&eacute;in Ministers and we can see, from the Northern Ireland Water debacle, how  dangerous such a course of action can be.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Lunn acknowledged that transfer is a stressful time and  advice is critical. He recognised that such guidance puts additional pressure  on primary-school heads and was rightly concerned about the impact on the  children.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My colleague Mervyn  Storey referred to a &lsquo;Belfast  Telegraph&rsquo; article in which Martin McGuinness stated:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Education does not have to be conflictual.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Clearly, the Minister did not get that memo. Mr  Storey highlighted, as I have done, the meddling, interfering and delay that  have been indicative of the Minister&rsquo;s tenure.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Roy Beggs then informed us that he was thankful for  parental choice, but sadly neglected to thank the DUP for retaining it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Paul Girvan spoke of the unease and discontent felt by  primary principals and the fact that the actions of the Minister would be to  the detriment of those whom she claims to want to help: the most disadvantaged  in society.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Basil McCrea spoke of the pleas from educationalists to put  children first. That should be at the root of all that we do. He referred to  the all-party group from which Sinn F&eacute;in excluded itself, and the potential  that that group had.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister claimed to have listened to what was said  during today&rsquo;s debate, but clearly that was not the case. I will not rehearse  her comments because there was nothing new, only her usual threats.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am unashamedly in favour of the use of academic criteria  in the transfer process. However, I call on those parties in the Chamber who do  not support academic selection to support the motion on the following grounds.  Due to the decisions that need to be made at a critical time in the lives of  their children, it is vital that parents be in possession of all the  information in advance of a transfer interview. To have interviews take place  in the absence of vital information is utterly pointless.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, and most importantly, it is wholly unfair on and  destabilising for our children. I urge the Minister to reconsider.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic"><strong>Resolved</strong>:</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly notes with concern the restrictions placed  by the Department of Education on primary-school principals and teachers who  wish to advise parents and pupils on post-primary transfer matters following  the issue of post-primary test results; and calls on the Minister of Education  to review her decision.</p>
