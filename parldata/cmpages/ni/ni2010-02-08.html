      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The Assembly met at 12.00 noon (Mr Speaker in the  Chair).</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="0"></a>Assembly Business</p>
      <p class="H4StageHeading">First Minister<span style="font-size:10.5pt; font-weight:normal; "> </span></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I wish to inform the Assembly that I have received a letter from the First  Minister, dated 3 February 2010, revoking with effect from that date his  earlier letter, in which he had designated the Minister of Enterprise, Trade  and Investment to exercise the functions of the office of First Minister.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading"><span class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="1"></a></span>Suspension of Standing Orders</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">That Standing Order 20(1)(a) be suspended for 8 February  2010.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. I refer you to the first item of business that  you dealt with, namely the letter from the First Minister in which he revoked  his decision to step down as First Minister. Given that his decisions to step  down and to step back into the office of First Minister were important  political developments and matters of high public interest and that those  decisions affected the authority and standing of both the Executive and the  Assembly &mdash; Mr Robinson is not just First Minister but a Member of the Assembly  &mdash; is it not in order that the terms of the opinion given to the First Minister  by Mr Paul Maguire QC should be lodged in the Assembly Library? Is it not in  order that the terms of reference given to Mr Maguire when forming his opinion  should be lodged in the Assembly Library? Is it not &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Order.  Those are matters for the First Minister to deal with. It is not for the House  to judge what the First Minister might do now or in the future. What I have  said this morning clarifies the situation as far as I am concerned. Thereafter,  those are decisions for the First Minister.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I understand why you have said that, Mr Speaker. However, the First Minister is  a Member of this House, serves at its discretion and was nominated to his  position by it. Therefore, matters in respect of stepping down from and back  into that office, on which I make no particular value judgement &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Member should take his place. There are avenues open to the Member,  and, if he wishes to pursue the matter, he can do so through questions to the  First Minister or through a motion in the House. Raising the matter through a  point of order will not be effective. I remind the House that there are  procedures: Members can speak to the Clerks about the procedures and  conventions through which they can raise issues properly in the House. It  should certainly not be done through points of order.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We shall return to the business. Before I put the Question,  I remind Members that the motion requires cross-community support.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved (with cross-community support):</p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">That Standing Order 20(1)(a) be suspended for 8 February  2010.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  As there are Ayes from all sides of the House and no dissenting voices, I am  satisfied that cross-community support has been demonstrated.</p>
      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="2"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
      <p class="H4StageHeading">SparkleBox Teacher Resource Website</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have received notice from the Minister of Education that she wishes to make a  statement.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education (Ms Ruane)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. T&aacute; br&oacute;n orm  go raibh an r&aacute;iteas deireannach. I apologise to the House for being late in  getting the statement to it. I finalised it on Friday night, and my officials  made final amendments this morning. This is an important issue, and I wanted to  ensure that we got the statement right.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Ba mhian liom r&aacute;iteas a thabhairt faoin l&aacute;ithre&aacute;n gr&eacute;as&aacute;in  acmhainn&iacute; m&uacute;inteora SparkleBox. SparkleBox is a website that contains resources  for primary-school teachers that can be downloaded for classroom use with  pupils. The site was owned and operated by Samuel Kinge, a teacher who had been  jailed in Warwick  in January 2005 for possession of child pornography.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Kinge started SparkleBox in February 2006, having changed  his name to Daniel Kinge. In September 2009, he was arrested again for making  and possessing indecent images of children. On 8 January 2010, Worcester Crown  Court sentenced him to 12 months in prison and served him with a 15&#8209;year sexual  offences prevention order, which bans him from using a computer unless it has a  police detection programme installed. The site was used by teachers in Ireland, North and South, and England, Wales  and Scotland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Bh&iacute; scoileanna anseo &aacute;balta teacht ar SparkleBox tr&iacute;d an  l&iacute;onra C2k, a shol&aacute;thra&iacute;onn seirbh&iacute;s bainistithe TFC do gach scoil  dheontasch&uacute;nta. Bainist&iacute;tear sol&aacute;thar na seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; thar ceann gach bord  oideachais agus leabharlainne ag Bord Oideachais agus Leabharlainne an  Iarthair.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">SparkleBox was available to schools here through the  Classroom 2000 (C2k) network, which provides an ICT-managed service to all  grant-aided schools. The provision of the service is managed on behalf of all  the education and library boards by the Western Education and Library Board.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am advised that C2k became aware of the issues surrounding  SparkleBox in December 2009. I understand that C2k liaised with the regional  broadband consortia in England,  a number of which had blocked access to SparkleBox until they were satisfied  that suitable safeguarding arrangements were in place. It appears that C2k took  the view that sufficient arrangements were in place to ensure the safety of  users; so, initially, it did not remove access to the site. It is C2k&rsquo;s  position that its system has automatic filters in place to block any possible  interactive component in the site, such as blogs and toolbars.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">On 28 January 2010, a parent from a Belfast primary school who had heard of  Kinge&rsquo;s conviction informed the school, which instructed its teachers not to  use SparkleBox and reported its position to C2k.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Ar 28 Ean&aacute;ir 2010 chuala tuismitheoir a raibh p&aacute;iste acu i  mbunscoil faoi chiont&uacute; Kinge agus threoraigh bunscoil Bh&eacute;al Feirste m&uacute;inteoir&iacute;  gan &uacute;s&aacute;id a bhaint as Sparklebox, agus a chuir a seasamh in i&uacute;l do C2k.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">On Monday 1 February, C2k changed its decision from not  blocking the site to blocking it, and I am advised that it informed schools of  that decision and that the site remains blocked.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Fuair m&eacute; fios ar an tsaincheist seo ar 29 Ean&aacute;ir. D&rsquo;eisigh  mo Roinn preasr&aacute;iteas le dearbh&uacute; go bhfuil scagair&iacute; i bhfeidhm ag an ch&oacute;ras C2k  le bac a chur le hinneachar dochrach gr&eacute;as&aacute;in, agus t&aacute; an Roinn ag comhoibri&uacute;  le C2k ar an tsaincheist seo.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I became aware of the issue on 29 January. My Department  issued a press statement to confirm that the C2k system has filters in place to  block potentially harmful web content and that the Department was liaising with  C2k on the matter.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mar is eol daoibh, glacaim an-d&aacute;ir&iacute;re dualgas mo Roinne le  cinnti&uacute; go gcosna&iacute;tear s&aacute;bh&aacute;ilteacht p&aacute;ist&iacute; i ngach gn&eacute; d&aacute; n-oideachas. Is  f&iacute;or-th&aacute;bhachtach dom a s&aacute;bh&aacute;ilteacht, agus f&eacute;achaim le m&eacute; f&eacute;in a chinnti&uacute; ar  bhonn lean&uacute;nach go bhfuil na polasaithe agus n&oacute;sanna imeachta at&aacute; i bhfeidhm  iomchu&iacute; agus &eacute;ifeachtach.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As Members will appreciate, I take very seriously my duty  and that of my Department to ensure that the safety of pupils is safeguarded in  all aspects of their education. I regard their safety as of paramount  importance, and I seek to ensure, on an ongoing basis, that the policies and  procedures in place are appropriate and effective. On a without-prejudice  basis, I remain to be convinced that responses to the particular situation were  proportionate and timely.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">D&aacute; bhr&iacute; sin, scr&iacute;obh mo Roinn chuig pr&iacute;omhfheidhmeannach  Bhord Oideachais agus Leabharlainne an Iarthair lena iarraidh air ini&uacute;chadh a  dh&eacute;anamh ar an d&oacute;igh ar bainist&iacute;odh an tsaincheist seo agus molta&iacute; a dh&eacute;anamh  ar cad iad na ceachtanna is f&eacute;idir a fhoghlaim &oacute;n cheist maidir le polasaithe  agus n&oacute;sanna imeachta a fheabhs&uacute; chun s&aacute;bh&aacute;ilteacht p&aacute;ist&iacute; a chosaint.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Accordingly, my Department has written to the chief  executive of the Western Education and Library Board to instruct him to  investigate the manner in which the situation was handled and to make  recommendations on what lessons can be learned from that to enhance further the  policies and procedures for protecting the safety of children. I expect a full  report on or before 24 March 2010.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Maidir leis an r&aacute;iteas seo, beidh m&eacute; ag scr&iacute;obh chuig Batt  O&rsquo;Keeffe TD, an tAire Oideachais agus Eola&iacute;ochta sa Deisceart, agus chuig mo  chomhghleacaithe aireachta i Sasana, in Albain agus sa Bhreatain Bheag le mo  chur chuige ar an tsaincheist seo a chur in i&uacute;l d&oacute;ibh.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">On the basis of this statement, I am writing to Batt  O&rsquo;Keeffe TD, Minister of Education and Science in the South, and to my  ministerial counterparts in England,  Scotland and Wales to inform  them of my approach to the matter.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Cuirfear c&oacute;ip den r&aacute;iteas seo chuig gach scoil agus  eagra&iacute;ocht eile at&aacute; faoi chothabh&aacute;il ag mo Roinn.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A copy of this statement will issue today to all schools and  other bodies that are grant-aided by my Department. My Department will issue  follow-up guidance to the circular on Internet safety that was issued in June  2007. That new guidance will specifically refer to safeguarding arrangements in  light of the SparkleBox experience.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Ina theannta sin, fanaim mo chuid feidhmeannach go hioml&aacute;n  i ngleic le hidirgh&uacute;pa aireachta na Roinne Sl&aacute;inte um chosaint p&aacute;ist&iacute;. T&aacute; an  gr&uacute;pa seo ag obair ar phlean gn&iacute;omha&iacute;ochta a chuirfidh bearta i bhfeidhm le  r&iacute;omh-sh&aacute;bh&aacute;ilteacht a fheabhs&uacute; do dhaoine &oacute;ga.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, my officials remain fully engaged with the  DHSSPS interdepartmental group on safeguarding children. That group is  progressing work on an action plan that will set in place measures to enhance  even further e-safety for our children and young people.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mar fhocal scoir, fanann an su&iacute;omh Sparklebox bactha ag  C2k, ini&uacute;chfar go hioml&aacute;n bainist&iacute;ocht an teagmhais seo, agus tiocfaidh m&eacute; ar  ais don Tion&oacute;l ar an tsaincheist seo chomh luath agus is f&eacute;idir.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The SparkleBox site remains blocked by C2k. The handling of  the incident will be fully investigated, and I will come back to the Assembly  on the matter at the earliest opportunity. I am also writing to all the website  providers to alert them to my concerns.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education (Mr Storey)</strong>: Obviously, this issue is of grave  concern to the House, and we welcome the fact that the Minister has come here  to make her statement. I inform the House that the Committee for Education  requested and received a briefing from Department of Education officials in  November 2009 on the measures that the Department had taken to provide  protection for children at school.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee was informed of new interagency structures,  including, this year, the establishment of the Safeguarding Board for Northern Ireland  and the current risk assessment arrangements for the supervision of convicted  sex offenders as provided by the Northern Ireland Sex Offender Strategic  Management Committee.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The SparkleBox case appears to expose a potential loophole  that allowed a convicted sex offender to run a website that was aimed at  schools and schoolchildren. Will the Minister assure the House that all  convicted, registered child sex offenders are banned from having direct contact  with children? Will she also explain what measures have been put in place in Northern Ireland  to detect sex offenders who are seeking to set up websites that are aimed at  schools and schoolchildren or seeking to work in such a business?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Speaking as a Member, I ask the Minister why it took a  parent to notify the school of the situation, despite the information having  been available since December 2009. Perhaps the Minister was being more than  generous when she said:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;I remain to be convinced that responses to that  particular situation were proportionate and timely.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The response was highly inappropriate, as it was left to a  parent. We must learn the lessons from that case.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister explain what measures will be put in  place immediately &mdash; as opposed to a review that will last for weeks &mdash; to  protect children?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Education</strong>:  I pay tribute to the parent and the schools involved. It is important that, as  parents, we are vigilant around Internet usage and safeguarding children. As  Members know, the issues are complex, and there have been many similar Internet  cases. Therefore, it is essential that police services across Ireland and between Britain  and Ireland  liaise closely. That is why, at some of the first meetings of the North/South  Ministerial Council, child protection was at the top of the agenda, where all  parties wanted it to be.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I share the Member&rsquo;s concerns that all children in Ireland, England,  Scotland and Wales need to  be protected. I pledge to do everything that I can to ensure that that happens  at all levels. It is a cross-cutting matter, across all Departments, and one  which involves education, health and police services.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I asked to make a statement because I do not believe that  any aspect of any issue that relates to safeguarding children should be hidden.  I have come here openly to give a detailed statement. I have asked for the  situation to be investigated &mdash; it is an investigation and not a review &mdash;  because it is an issue that I take very seriously. I am not going to pre-empt  the outcome of that. However, I have questions, which the investigation will  look at, and I expect very clear answers.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">One reason for the investigation is so that we can  constantly learn and update our information. As I said, guidelines were brought  forward in 2007. However, those guidelines need to be constantly updated. I,  along with my Department, am contacting service providers in the North, in England, Scotland  and Wales, and throughout  the island of Ireland. We must block off all loopholes.  I hope that that answers the Member&rsquo;s question.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to talk briefly about child protection in schools. Through  the curriculum, pupils are encouraged to develop strategies to keep safe. The  personal development strand of the revised curriculum provides a vehicle for conveying  messages about normal and acceptable behaviour, problem solving and sources of  help and advice. Also, all staff, paid and unpaid, who are working in schools  must be vetted to ensure that only suitable people work with pupils. In due  course, they will be required to join the new vetting and barring scheme. Also,  the arrangements set out in this paper for ensuring the appropriate response  when concerns are raised about an individual pupil will aid child protection.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As the Member knows, all schools have a named designated  teacher for child protection and a named deputy designated teacher. Go raibh  maith agat.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for her  statement. What guidance or measures on Internet usage does the Department have  in place to assist schools?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Go raibh maith agat as an cheist sin. Since April 2003, all  grant-aided schools have been required to implement a child protection policy.  When preparing its policy, a school must take into account the most recent  advice from the Department of Education, the relevant education and library  board and, in the case of Catholic maintained schools, the Council for Catholic  Maintained Schools.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Advice to schools on child protection matters is issued by  means of a departmental education circular. All advice issued by the Department  is consistent with the Department of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety&rsquo;s document &lsquo;Co-operating to Safeguard Children&rsquo; and the policies and  procedures of the regional area child protection committee.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Schools are supported in their work to safeguard children  by the Child Protection Support Service for Schools (CPSSS), which is based in  each education and library board. The CPSSS operates a helpline for school staff  on child protection issues and is accessible every day during term time. The  CPSSS provides an extensive range of training and capacity building to  designated teachers, principals, members of boards of governors and other staff  who work with pupils and support schools with individual cases.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Every school inspection includes an examination of the  arrangements for pastoral care and child protection by the Education and  Training Inspectorate (ETI), and there is an agreed procedure in cases where a  school&rsquo;s arrangements are rated as unsatisfactory. In such cases, the ETI will  reassess the position after six weeks, and, if the necessary improvements have  not been made, the Department will intervene.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The advice and guidance given to schools are kept under  continuous review. Within DE, the safeguarding advisory group comprises all key  policy areas with responsibilities that contribute to child protection. It  meets quarterly to review developments and exchange information. A standing  group, the designated officers for child protection in education group  (DOCPEG), has representatives from each of the education and library boards and  is chaired by the Department. It meets monthly to consider emerging issues,  such as the one that we are discussing, that arrive from casework in schools  and developments in policy and best practice on safeguarding children in Ireland and  elsewhere.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Representation of the schools sector&rsquo;s interests at an  operational level &mdash; on health and social services boards &mdash; is undertaken by  members of DOCPEG.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  The Minister has outlined her concern on this issue. Is it possible to find out  who has visited the website and discover whether any harmful material was  downloaded?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: As I said, I do not want to pre-empt the outcome of the  investigation. I will bring the Member&rsquo;s question to the Western Education and  Library Board. I was advised that there was no harmful content on the website,  but I await the outcome of the investigation.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. This issue is of great concern to all  Members. It is important that we reassure teachers and parents today that the  system fully protects children in our schools and at home.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Instead of waiting for the outcome of any inquiry, will the  Minister issue guidance today to C2k and the Western Education and Library  Board informing them that immediate action will be taken and that schools will  be informed directly if any similar situation occurs?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: My officials have been in touch with C2k. I will send a copy of  the statement to schools, but I have informed the House first because it is  appropriate to do so. There should be no hiding place for people who download  pornography or have been convicted of offences that relate to pornography. The  key issue is to protect our children and young people, and I will take every  possible measure to ensure that our children are protected. I will take the  Member&rsquo;s comments on board. C2k and the Western Education and Library Board  understand exactly the importance that I place on this issue, and they  understand that harmful material needs to be blocked immediately.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: I  welcome the fact that the site has been blocked and that a full investigation  will take place. Does the Minister have any information about the extent to  which the site was used? The site provides resources for teachers. Has it been  regarded as useful? I had never heard of it until recently. As Basil McCrea  said, has any suspect material been found on the site? Lastly &#8213; if I am allowed  to ask another question &#8213; it seems incredible that, given that the surname of  the person in question has such an unusual spelling, he avoided the law at the  outset of the episode by merely changing his Christian name. What checks are in  place to prevent that happening in the first place?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I share the Member&rsquo;s concern about people being able to change  their name. The latest conviction was his second. The best check is for  organisations in the health sector, the education sector and police services  across Ireland and Britain to work  together. We need to learn from this episode, and that is one reason why I will  write to my counterparts in the South of Ireland and in England, Scotland  and Wales.  The best way to deal with the situation is to make information public so that  the occurrence of a similar incident becomes much less likely. I have been  informed that there was no suspect material on the site. However, I will await  the outcome of the investigation.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. Is the Minister here today voluntarily, or  was she advised by others to update the Assembly? Given that it is Internet  safety week, it is timely to seek assurance that Internet safety is a key  priority of the Department of Education. Will the Minister outline the input  that her Department has given to the ministerial subgroup on safeguarding  Internet safety? Moreover, will she provide an update on her Department&rsquo;s  interface with the work of the UK Council for Child Internet Safety?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I asked to make a statement in the House, because I understand  the importance of the issues and I want to take appropriate action. As I said,  child safety is paramount.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">My Department actively works with the health sector and  other organisations on Internet safety. I discussed suicide prevention and  Internet use with my colleague Michael McGimpsey and the various working  groups. That is a key issue, as is child pornography. I sit on the working  group that deals with violence against women and children, and I take that  issue very seriously. Indeed, my Department is working on a programme to  consider the whole issue of sexual and domestic violence against women and  children. This incident is part and parcel of that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is timely that this is Internet safety week. We need to  learn from good practice not only on these islands but across Europe  and across the world. The more we share good practice, the more chance we have  of ensuring that individuals such as the person involved in this case cannot  continue to operate as they have in the past.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement and  the importance that she has attached and attention that she has given to the  issue.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important not to scaremonger, but parents have  genuine concerns. Although the site is now blocked, what assurances can the  Minister give to parents that previous use of the site has not allowed children  to access questionable material?</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: As I said, my information to date is that there is no harmful  material on that website. Nevertheless, the investigation is continuing, and I  will report back fully to the House on that. I want to reassure parents as best  I can. I am a parent, and I understand the difficulties that surround Internet  access. The Internet can be a very positive tool, but, equally, if it is not  monitored and safeguarded correctly, it can be a very dangerous tool. As  parents, we have huge responsibilities. Parents can be reassured that C2k has  blocked the website even though no harmful material was found on it. It is  right and proper that that website should be blocked.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: The  Minister said that C2k became aware of this issue in December 2009, but that  she had not been made aware of it until 29 January 2010. Will she tell the  House why that was the case, and why she was not informed immediately about  something of such magnitude? Will she tell the House what protocols exist to  inform her immediately when something as serious as this occurs? When C2k took  its initial decision, in the belief that adequate safeguards were in place, who  did it consult to come to that determination?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I should have been informed as soon as C2k was aware of the situation.  Indeed, I should have been informed in September 2009, when the individual was  charged. The investigation needs to look at that. We must learn from that;  procedures must be put in place across Ireland  and Britain  to ensure that action is taken to inform the relevant authorities as soon as  someone is charged with such offences. The investigation will examine all my  Department&rsquo;s procedures and protocols as well as those of other bodies. This  situation has an effect not just on education but on wider society, and it is  an issue for police services across these islands.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  The Minister said that her officials are engaged in the investigation process.  What has her personal involvement been in overseeing C2k&rsquo;s protection policies?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I work very closely with all my officials on safeguarding and  child protection. As soon as I heard about the matter in question, I called a  meeting of senior officials. Safeguarding was one of the key areas of  discussion. I told the meeting that I wanted to explain the situation to the  Assembly immediately, and work began immediately to draw up my statement.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am personally involved daily in child protection. I have  worked with my officials to institute a new programme for safeguarding children  in schools, and I will provide the House with details of that programme in the  near future. It is starting in primary schools so that we can train teachers to  look at the issues of domestic and sexual violence in an age-appropriate way  and ensure that we deal with some of those issues at the earliest possible  stage.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have always said that violence against women and children  at all levels is one of the key challenges facing our society, and I take it  very seriously. We are looking at those issues from the point of view of our  special educational needs and inclusion strategy. That is very important, and I  am glad that some good may come out of my making a statement today. The more  that we speak about this issue, and the more that we work across Departments,  North and South, east and west, the better chance that we have of dealing with  people such as the person who was found guilty of downloading images.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I am sure that the House will be concerned to hear that I believe there to be a  factual inaccuracy in the Minister&rsquo;s statement. It was, in fact, on 28 December  2009 that a parent of a pupil at Stranmillis  Primary School in south Belfast approached me in  my capacity as a Member of the Assembly and made me aware of the situation. I,  in turn, informed the school, and by way of a written question for two-day  priority answer, I informed the Department of Education of the situation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Why has my question for written answer, which was tabled on  28 January 2010 and was due for answer on 2 February 2010, not yet been  answered? Furthermore, why was her Department asleep on its watch? What does  that say about the record of the Assembly, the Executive and her party on child  protection? It is simply not good enough. The answer to that question for written  answer has not been received, and many parents will want proper answers as to  why the Minister had to come to the House to make a statement for us to get the  answers that we sought.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I have answered the Member&rsquo;s question, and I welcome the tone of  the debate. Nobody should play politics with this important issue. These are  complex matters, and Internet safety is complex. I pledge to do everything that  I can to protect our children.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I came to the House to explain what we are doing and to  make sure that there will be a thorough investigation into the matter. I have  answered the Member&rsquo;s question, but before I could do so, I needed to  investigate the matter fully and thoroughly. If there is an inaccuracy in the  statement, I will correct it. The key point, however, is that we should not be  playing politics. This is an issue that all of us must deal with together.  Joint all-party working groups are dealing with issues such as violence against  women and children. They are also dealing with suicide prevention, and the role  of the Internet in that matter concerns us, too. Michael McGimpsey did very  good work on that issue, and I was a member of the working group that dealt  with it. Therefore, if there is an inaccuracy in the statement, I will correct  it, but, please, do not play politics with child protection.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. I know that I am new to the House, and I may  be forgiven for misreading Standing Orders, but I understand that the process  for dealing with a two-day priority question for written answer is just that &mdash;  a two-day process. That method was used on this occasion to expedite the  information and to bring it into the public domain. I have still not received  an answer to my question for written answer.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I certainly hear what the Member said. I have made it clear in the House and  elsewhere on many occasions that I expect Members to get very prompt answers to  priority questions for written answer that are asked of any Department. I have raised  the matter in the past with the Executive, and I will do so in the future.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. I raised with you previously the difficulty of  receiving ministerial statements just as Members are about to speak on the  matter in question. This is a serious issue; it is not an attempt to have a go  at the Minister, because she apologised. I understand that, and that is fair  enough. However, we need to find a way to get statements to Members in time for  them to make proper responses. I need your help in that, Mr Speaker.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Once again, I hear the Member&rsquo;s point of order. I have continually urged  Ministers that they should, as far as possible, make statements available much  earlier. However, the Minister apologised to the House, and she gave a frank  reason as to why the statement was late.</p>

      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  As no amendments have been selected, there is no opportunity to discuss the  Water and Sewerage Services (Amendment) Bill today. Members will, of course, be  able to have a full debate at Final Stage. Further Consideration Stage is,  therefore, concluded. The Bill stands referred to the Speaker.</p>

      <p class="H4StageHeading">McElhill/McGovern Tragedy in Omagh</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30 minutes for  the debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes in which to propose  and 10 minutes in which to make a winding up speech. All other Members who wish  to speak will have five minutes.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Jim Wells, Chairperson of the Committee for Health, Social  Services and Public Safety, was to move the motion. Unfortunately, Jim has been  taken ill, and our thoughts are with him. Michelle O&rsquo;Neill, the Deputy Chairperson  of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety, has kindly  stepped into the breach.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for Health,  Social Services and Public Safety (Mrs <strong>O&rsquo;Neill)</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I also extend my best wishes to Jim,  and I hope that he makes a speedy recovery.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The events of 13 November 2007 were appalling. Seven  people, five of whom were children, died in a house fire in the Lammy area of  Omagh. The magnitude of that outrage, which was one of the most horrific cases  ever seen, warrants a public inquiry.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">However, the Committee thought long and hard before  agreeing to table the motion. Members did not want an inquiry to rake up the  tragedy of the events in Omagh or to cause more pain to the families and  individuals involved. The Committee wants to take into account the feelings of  the bereaved McElhill and McGovern families, who have suffered over the past  two years. Those two families are not the only ones who suffered, as the tragic  event had a considerable impact on the local community. That is why individual  members of the Committee were tasked with discussing the possibility of a  public inquiry either with communities in the Omagh area or with their local  party representatives.</p>
      <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Dallat] in the Chair)</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion calls for a time-bound inquiry into the  multi-agency aspects of the tragedy, and it does not aim to rake up the events.  From consulting individual members of the families involved, we understand  that, in those limited circumstances, they would cautiously welcome an inquiry.  A number of reviews have taken place since the Omagh tragedy, including the  coroner&rsquo;s report and the wide-ranging Toner report. It covered the health,  social services and education aspects of the event, and it was welcomed at the  time. The Committee heard from the Western Trust that the Toner report&rsquo;s  recommendations have been extremely useful. The recommendations were accepted  fully and have helped to shape and improve children&rsquo;s services across the  North.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee is aware that the Minister of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety has asked Henry Toner QC to revisit the Western  Trust to find out whether and how his recommendations have been implemented.  The Committee welcomes the Minister&rsquo;s actions, but is still concerned that new  information has come to light as a result of the coroner&rsquo;s report. That  information reminds us that numerous agencies, not only the Western Health and  Social Care Trust, were involved in the awful tragedy.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The police, the Probation Board and the Prison Service also  had roles to play. After the events, each of those organisations held an  internal review in addition to a multi-agency case review. The Committee has  seen and considered the multi-agency case review, which was highly specific. It  focused on the inter-agency handling of Arthur McElhill as a registered sex  offender from his time in prison until his death in November 2007. The Committee&rsquo;s  view is that the public inquiry should consider the roles of all those  organisations and, specifically, how they interacted.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Western Trust has been open and public about its role  in the events. That is to be commended, as it helped to raise public confidence  that the trust is not trying to hide anything. When the Committee spoke with  the trust recently, members were impressed by how seriously it took the Toner  report&rsquo;s recommendations on child protection. We also became aware of the  impact that the tragedy has had on staff in the Western Trust and the amount of  stress and strain under which they have been placed. Social services staff were  particularly devastated by the tragedy.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As Deputy Chairperson of the Committee, I acknowledge that  people working in child protection have a difficult job. It is an incredibly  complicated and stressful job, yet, every day, in a quiet and private manner,  social services staff in the Western Trust work to protect and to look after  children. I hope that I have been clear that the Committee is not interested in  social-worker bashing. We recognise that they do a difficult job, often in  trying and heart-rending circumstances, with little public acknowledgement but  a high degree of professionalism.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">However, the other organisations involved, such as the PSNI  and the Probation Board, lie outside the remit of the Department of Health,  Social Services and Public Safety. Those agencies are not devolved and remain  under the remit of the Secretary of State. Therefore, the motion calls on the  Minister to seek the consent of the Secretary of State to the multi-agency  inquiry. The Committee wants a public examination of how those agencies worked  together, communicated, relayed information and acted on their joint concerns.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">An inquiry should take account of that and, indeed, of the  information that emerged from the recent coroner&rsquo;s report. It should not focus  solely on the Western Trust. The inquiry should be time-bound because we do not  want an expensive inquiry that runs for months or even years. The Committee  does not want any wallowing in the horrible details of the case, but it wants  to ensure that such a terrible situation can never be allowed to arise again.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">12.45 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee will soon focus some of its attention on the  policy area of child protection. At the end of February, we will begin a  detailed and focused consideration of the main issues and factors in relation  to safeguarding children and how to improve multi-agency working. We have  arranged to take evidence from a range of bodies, including the PSNI,  children&rsquo;s charities and health and social care trusts. We will use that  opportunity to explore the issues concerning multi-agency working in an attempt  to improve the situation. On behalf of the Committee for Health, Social  Services and Public Safety, I ask Members to support the motion.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Doherty</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I support the motion and  congratulate the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety for  bringing the debate to the House. The tragic events of Tuesday 13 November  2007, when a fire killed seven people &mdash; two adults and five children &mdash; were  traumatic for everyone concerned: the McGovern family, the McElhill family, the  local community of Lammy in Omagh, the emergency services, social workers, the  wider Omagh community and local elected representatives.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In coming to my decision to call for a public inquiry, I  read the Toner report, the Watkins report and the inquest reports. I also had a  number of meetings with various agencies and the two families concerned. Before  Christmas, I met the personnel responsible for public protection arrangements,  including the PSNI. Broadly speaking, their view was that the Watkins report  covered all their responsibilities and that the new public protection  arrangements had corrected any shortcomings that may have existed in the old  multi-agency sex offender risk assessment and management (MASRAM) arrangements.  The people responsible for the public protection arrangements did not see any  great value in a public inquiry.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Before and after Christmas, I had meetings and conducted  telephone conversations with the McGovern and McElhill families. The McGovern  family and, indeed, the McElhill family were hugely concerned about the  re-emergence of public focus on the case. However, the McGovern family felt  that they would go along with a public inquiry if it could save any other  person or family.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The McElhill family was hugely affected by the tragedy and  felt that they, as an extended family, were being blamed for what happened;  they were traumatised. Both families had a huge number of questions that they  wanted to be answered. The McElhill family was not particularly convinced that  a public inquiry would help; they were neither for nor against the idea.  However, although the family was afraid of the public focus that may be placed  on it, its members still had many questions that they wanted to be answered.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I met senior representatives from the Department of Health,  Social Services and Public Safety who felt that the 63 recommendations of the  Toner report had met all the demands. On the same day, I met Paul Goggins from  the NIO. He referred to the Watkins and Toner reports and said that although he  was not minded to hold a public inquiry, he was minded to try to find a  mechanism that would provide answers to the families&rsquo; questions.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I was also in touch with the Policing Board, and I am glad  to say that it has made moves for social workers to work in co-operation with  the PSNI. I meet the Lammy community representative regularly, and I am mindful  that a spokesperson for the social workers&rsquo; trade union has called for a public  inquiry.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Having read the Toner report, the Watkins report and the  findings of the inquest, and having held all the meetings to which I have  referred, I conclude that there was a lack of cohesion among the agencies. That  can, and has, led to warning signals not being noted. Such warning signals can  prevent tragedies from occurring. Therefore, I support the motion and call for  a public inquiry.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As we strive to secure the Secretary of State&rsquo;s agreement  for a public inquiry, we must be mindful of the acute sensitivities of everyone  involved, particularly those of the families and the local community in Lammy,  Omagh. An example of that is the burnt-out remains of the McElhill home.  However, communication is under way between the Housing Executive and the  McElhill family to have that issue resolved. The community is well aware of that.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member please bring his remarks to a close?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Doherty</strong>:  I thank the Western Education and Library Board&rsquo;s critical incident response  team, which supported the local community throughout the trauma, and I thank  the emergency services.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Like others, I wish the Chairperson of the Committee a speedy recovery.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The tragedy that occurred in Omagh in November 2007 was a  truly awful event for the families of those involved, the wider community, the  town and the district. An entire family perished in the fire. It was a human  tragedy, and it brings very sobering thoughts to us all. The whole House offers  its sympathy to the families and the community on the memory of that awful  event.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is clear that there were failings in the system with  respect to the McElhill case. In at least 10 points in the Toner report, the  panel found instances when what should have been done was not done. Toner  concluded that although none of the agencies involved had any indication that  such tragic events were about to happen, those agencies identified processes  that could have been better carried out. The files of previous relevant cases  should have been sought by those involved in the McElhill case at particular  points, but they were not. Information that should have been passed from one  agency to another was not passed on. A risk-management discussion should have  taken place, but it did not. The Toner panel identified those failings and drew  them to public attention. They are now in the public domain, together with the  panel&rsquo;s recommendations, and that is important. Failings have been identified,  together with recommendations on how to ensure that they do not recur. We can  all read those recommendations, and Members, particularly members of the Health  Committee, can check the progress made by the Department of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety in implementing them.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Toner inquiry was independent, thorough and covered all  the relevant agencies. The report makes recommendations that involve the Police  Service, and the panel included a senior police officer. Recently, the Minister  asked Mr Toner to return to the Western Trust to ensure that those  recommendations are being implemented. The Committee will want to make similar  checks.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Let me reiterate: mistakes were made, they have been  identified and steps have been taken to ensure that they are not repeated. The  people involved have been informed of what they did wrong in this case. No  useful purpose would be served by asking those people the same questions that  Mr Toner asked them, simply so that they may be held up to blame. I do not wish  to see the community in Omagh or the bereaved families put through another  inquiry unless there is sound reason for it. There might be reason for it if a case  can be made that Toner was not independent, was not sufficiently wide ranging,  or did not cover all the issues. I remain to be convinced that that case has  been made.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As the motion implies, the Secretary of State is  responsible for initiating an inquiry. The Health Committee should, perhaps,  ask for his opinion and seek to persuade him that an inquiry is necessary.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Toner inquiry was independent and thorough. It also  identified all the salient information about the case, so would a repeat of  that process be a good use of time? I aired my concerns about holding a public  inquiry when the matter was discussed by the Health Committee. Mr Doherty  talked about the effect that such an inquiry could have on the families and the  community, although I accept that he thought that a public inquiry was  necessary. However, after hearing evidence from the communities and Ulster  Unionist Party representatives in that area, I am certainly not convinced that  a public inquiry would be welcomed by everyone.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">When people talk about public inquiries &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Bring your remarks to a close, please.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I have huge concerns about how a time-bound public inquiry would be held.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I associate myself with the Deputy Chairperson&rsquo;s condolences to the families  and the wider community who were bereaved as a result of that dreadful tragedy.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee thought very seriously about the wording of  the motion because this is a very sensitive subject. The last thing that anyone  wishes to do is to make life more distressful for anyone involved or to open  wounds that people are trying to heal. The length of time between the tragedy  and the process of the coroner&rsquo;s inquest has not allowed people an opportunity  to grieve or to come to terms with their dreadful loss.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McCallister made it clear that the Toner report and the  Watkins report were very wide-ranging and that many lessons were learned. He  asked whether there were any gaps, which is one of the areas that we need to  look at. The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee said that if additional  information came about through the inquest, there may well be a gap that needs  to be addressed. That needs to be given some consideration.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members paid tribute to the many good staff who work  in very difficult psychological and emotional cases in which the best and worst  of human relation&shy;ships are exposed. We are told that 54 of the Toner report&rsquo;s  55 recommendations in respect of trusts have been implemented. It would be  helpful if the Minister could outline whether all those have been implemented  fully and whether the lessons were learned across all the trusts in the North,  because the lack of investment in social services goes much wider than the  McElhill/McGovern issue.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have been disappointed that the Health Committee has not  concentrated on social services as much as it ought to. It has given a lot of  consideration to health matters, sometimes to the detriment of other areas of  responsibility that the Committee has to scrutinise.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s presence for the debate. I noted  that he said that an additional &pound;20 million would be invested in social  services up to the end of 2011. How much of that &pound;20 million is new money and  additional resource? Does it come from existing budgets? We all know how  difficult it is to recruit social workers into childcare. Retaining them is  even more difficult because of the emotional toil that it takes on their lives,  never mind the work that it involves overall.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">1.00 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There are lessons to be learned by the police, the Policing  Board and other agencies. There is also a real responsibility on us, as a  society, to protect our children. So-called nosy neighbours who peek out from  behind curtains and comment on what they see have a place in society. However,  they must do something about what they see and report wrongdoing. We are all  challenged not to stand idly by, merely look on or turn away from goings-on in  our own communities.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Our party will carefully consider the call for a public  inquiry. I look forward to hearing from the Minister. The motion has been  carefully worded. As Mr McCallister said, we should find out what the Criminal  Justice Minister, Mr Paul Goggins, has to say, because some of the  responsibility for an inquiry lies with him. The Minister of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety may have had those conversations, and I hope that he  will inform the House of their outcome.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>:  My contribution to the debate will be brief. I join other Members in wishing  the Chairman of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety  well. I hope that he makes a speedy recovery.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Alliance Party Members support the motion tabled by the  Committee. The tragedy was yet another major blow for Omagh. I went to Omagh  the day after the bomb in 1998, and the community has again been badly affected  by the incident at Lammy Crescent,  which should never have happened. The warning signs were already there and  should have been acted upon.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Toner inquiry was extensive, and many of its  recommendations have been implemented. It is important to learn lessons from  the tragedy. If the warning signs had been heeded, the event might not have  happened. However, the final point that I want to make is that what happened  was a tragedy and our condolences must go to the families concerned. If a  public inquiry is held, I hope that it will not be lengthy or as expensive as  so many of the public inquiries in Northern Ireland over the years.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  I support the motion. I grew up near, and have close associations with, Omagh.  The town is dear to my heart. I have been privileged to serve on its council  since 1993 and to represent the area in the Assembly since 2007.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We all know that Omagh has experienced more than its fair  share of tragedy. It is famous all over the world for the worst terrorist  atrocity of the Troubles. In August 1998, 29 persons and two unborn children  were brutally murdered; something that tore the town apart. It took quite some  time to rebuild community relations in Omagh to the level that had existed  before the bombing.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Just nine years later, tragedy struck again when, on 13  November 2007, a fire broke out in Lammy    Crescent, in which a whole family &mdash; mother, father  and five young children aged from 10 months to 13 years &mdash; perished.  Unsurprisingly, there was immediate shock and horror at such a dreadful event.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The whole country was stunned by what, at first, seemed to  be a terrible but natural tragedy. However, news began to emerge that the fire  was started deliberately by a father, who had, himself, died, and feelings of  shock and horror turned to ones of disbelief and anguish. We were faced with a  suicide and multiple murder; an absolute nightmare. Then, as evidence began to  emerge about Arthur McElhill, disbelief turned to anger. Everywhere I went,  people rightly asked how on earth the authorities could have failed to heed all  the warning signs. That question was very difficult to answer.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is more than two years since those appalling events, but  the pain and agony of the two families whose loved ones died in the fire is  still very real. In addition, at the end of last year, they had to endure the  ordeal of an inquest. Our thoughts and prayers must continue to be with the  McGovern and McElhill families. We must remember that their pain will go on; it  will not be forgotten, so they must not be forgotten. However, in this debate,  it would not be fair to them to go into the events of November 2007 in any  detail. Indeed, it is not necessary to do so.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">To make sure that the Lammy Crescent tragedy never happens  again, it is important that lessons are learned. In that case, the failures by  the relevant agencies were among the worst to be found anywhere. They were  basic, fundamental and, worst of all, totally inexcusable. Although failures  were found in particular key agencies, there is also evidence of an amazing  lack of co-ordination and communication between those agencies. Why, on the  basis of clear and extensive evidence going back several years, was Arthur  McElhill, a convicted sex offender, regarded by officials as only being at low  risk to himself and others? Why was preventative action that might have spared  his life and the lives of his innocent partner and children not taken? Arthur  McElhill had been known to the criminal and care authorities since 1993, but he  was able to slip through the net, with most dreadful consequences.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the 63 recommendations in the Toner report, which  was published last July. I welcome the progress that has been made on  implementing Henry Toner&rsquo;s recommendations, but, to ensure that they are fully  and swiftly implemented, I urge the Health Minister to keep the pressure on the  authorities. Nevertheless, in light of what emerged from the Toner report and  the recent inquest, there would be merit in holding a public inquiry. I know  that inquiries can be costly and, sometimes, their conclusions can be  ambiguous; however, in this case, the issues are so serious that a time-bound  investigation would be a worthwhile exercise. Indeed, I go further and say that  an investigation is vital to ensure that lessons are learned and such tragedies  do not happen again.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member should bring his remarks to a close.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  We have no desire to go back over the events of the tragedy. Nothing that we do  can undo what happened of that dreadful day in November 2007.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Deputy Speaker has called on me to finish. I support the  motion.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I also send my best wishes to the  Chairperson of the Health Committee.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As a member of the Health Committee and as an MLA for West  Tyrone, the constituency in which the awful tragedy occurred, I support the  motion. There has been a lot of pain associated with the case, to which the  local MP, Pat Doherty, referred, and he has spoken to the families. Therefore,  I do not want to say anything that might add to the pain of anyone who was  engaged with or in any way involved in the tragedy.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The McElhill/McGovern case is complex and multifaceted, and  the two reports that are in the public domain, the Toner report and the Watkins  report, illustrate those different aspects. Clearly, each report has a  different focus and emphasis.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I commend the Western Trust for implementing the Toner  report&rsquo;s recommendations. It is obvious in that report that mistakes were made  and that the system did not work for the family. However, I must say that my  reading of the Watkins report gave me no sense that the same gaps, issues and  difficulties existed. For that reason, I believe that the motion is appropriate  in this case. I want to repeat that its aim is not to raise a sensitive issue  again and to cause difficulty for anyone who was involved with that particular  tragedy.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I shall quote from the Toner report to illustrate its  points and to tie them in with the Health Committee&rsquo;s motion. The report  states:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;there were misconceptions on the part of many  involved from the police and Social Services as to the role of the other agency  and what might reasonably be expected from that other agency.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It goes on to state:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Interagency/ multi-disciplinary working across  the range of professionals and other agencies was weak, confirmed through the  records examined, interviews conducted and comments received from the various  agencies&rdquo;.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As I have said, it is commendable that the Western Trust  has implemented a number of the Toner Report&rsquo;s recommendations.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I turn now to the Watkins report. Comments have been made  about the NIO. It issued a press release after the publication of the report,  stating:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The report found that there were no material  deficiencies in inter-agency co-operation in relation to the delivery of the  MASRAM arrangements in the case of Arthur McElhill.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Watkins report&rsquo;s introduction refers to the case,  which, it states:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;did not appear to have any sexual dimension&rdquo;.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Point 7 of the report states:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Our approach has been, as required by the terms of  reference, to retain the focus on McElhill as a sex offender&rdquo;.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Point 11 states:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;McElhill was also required to be placed on the Sex  Offender Register indefinitely&rdquo;.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, the PSNI visited the family many times. The  Watkins report commends it for doing so. It states:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The PSNI then visited McElhill again (and finally, as  it turned out) on 5 November, noting no cause for concern.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The entire McElhill family perished on 13 November  2007.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  The events that happened in Omagh were, undoubtedly, a tragedy. We were all  shocked to hear initial reports and what subsequently came to bear. It is  perhaps worth saying that just because a tragedy happens does not necessarily  mean that everyone is at fault.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As a member of the Policing Board, I chair its human rights  and professional standards committee. I want to clarify for the Deputy  Chairperson of the Health Committee that the PSNI is under the oversight of  politicians who represent all parties. The committee has looked at the issue.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">1.15 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is perhaps worth adding that I have spoken to the senior  police officers involved and to others, and they have said that the  decision-making process would not have changed, based on the information that  was put forward to them. There was an offence in 1993 and a further offence in  1998, and, in 2004, a review was undertaken and the priority for Mr McElhill  was downgraded from category two to category one. On that basis, the  responsibility moved to the PSNI, and the designated risk manager visited Mr  McElhill regularly, in line with requirements under the MASRAM procedures.  However, there is an issue about the message that we all send out to the  general public. I think that we are in danger of castigating members of staff  in the social services, the PSNI and elsewhere, who work in really difficult situations.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The point that I put to the House is that if lessons have  been learned and the appropriate working relationships are now improved, one  would have to consider whether a public inquiry is the right way to go, because  there is a danger that an excessive amount of money could be spent on learning  lessons that have already been learned. Therefore, perhaps a report should come  from the House.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Our party will abstain from voting on the motion. We are  open to persuasion, but there is sometimes a danger of having to be seen to be  doing something because there has been a tragedy, and the public demand that  something ought to be done about it. If all the right things had been done, or  are being done, we would be better placed to use resources to prevent tragedies  from happening in the future, rather than reporting on past tragedies.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">At a senior level, we have not stepped up to the mark in  respect of a number of issues. When the coroner&rsquo;s report was published, the  multi-agency response was abysmal. Nobody came forward to explain the  situation, and none of the organisations said that they were going to step  forward and explain it to people for fear of being castigated as the agency  that was responsible.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The procedures must be tightened up. As things stand,  Assistant Chief Constable Will Kerr chairs the committee, and I have told him  that he has to decide which agency is responsible. Is the committee simply a  get-together, or does it have some statutory responsibility? Are there other  things that we need to do? The public confidence messages that we send out are  important.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Having looked closely at the public protection units, the  PSNI has brought in some excellent measures, and it carries out its work in  very trying circumstances. Recommendation 54 of the Toner report states that  the PSNI should consider the secondment of a social services staff member.  However, the difficulty was that we could not get anybody to come and do that  work because of recruitment issues. People are trying to work together on these  trying, difficult areas, and they need support. I urge the House to send a  clear message to the public that we are on top of the matter, we are working  together on it, and we are going to make the appropriate decisions to safeguard  the people of Northern    Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  I, too, want to say at the outset that the families who have been caught up in  the centre of this tragedy have suffered great hurt and pain. There is also  sadness and sorrow in the wider Omagh community. The McElhill family home is in  County Fermanagh, and some of the family still  live there with their parents, while others live in Tyrone and elsewhere. The  McGovern family home is across the border in County Cavan.  For those families, pain is an everyday experience, and it is something that  simply will not go away.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have spoken to some of the family members, and they say  that the wounds of the event can be reopened by an occurrence as simple as  passing a shop, when they are out and about, and seeing newspapers or magazines  that are reporting something to do with the tragedy. That is how they live.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am not entirely convinced about the need for a public  inquiry. We have to rely on the professionals and respect their advice on such  sensitive issues as this. We also have to listen to the public. I am getting a  strong message from the public, aside from the families who have been caught up  in the tragedy. The public are asking why we would throw money on more  inquiries. They are saying that there are serious problems in homes where  children live and where they are at risk and that money should be spent in that  area. We have to keep all those things in balance.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Reference has been made to the Toner report and to the  other reports that look at the serious cases that are being covered by the PSNI  and the Prison Service. We must ensure that every letter of every  recommendation in those reports is implemented. Members will hear from the  Minister shortly, but I believe that there is a case in favour of the  Department appointing to the Western Trust an independent individual to ensure  that every weakness that is highlighted is dealt with and that the same  mistakes will not happen again.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In 2009, we had the death of a young baby girl in her home  in Enniskillen. The report of the western area&rsquo;s childcare committee was  published recently, and we have to be concerned about its conclusions. In the  past year, the PSNI in Fermanagh forwarded 52 prosecution files to the PPS.  Those files related to child abuse, which, as Members know, could be physical  or sexual abuse. That pattern is replicated across the western area in the  Omagh and Derry districts. In addition, the  number of children on the child protection register has grown noticeably over  the past three years. That confirms that something has to be done now to ensure  the safety of young children, even in their own homes.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Setting up public inquiries merely because of startling  headlines might be a distraction from a growing problem, and I have mentioned  some of the facts around that. There are, therefore, increased demands for  assistance from social services and family support services and for the  services that they provide, which, at present, are badly under-resourced and  undermanned. Those services in the west are under a lot of pressure; the  figures speak for themselves. We cannot continue like that. The Deputy  Chairperson of the Health Committee said that there would be a Committee  inquiry, and there is a possibility of a public inquiry.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member draw his remarks to a close?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  Those sorts of inquiries must not distract staff resources, which are already  scarce, from a very serious problem. To do so, will demoralise the staff in the  area who are working valiantly and leave them fed up, alone and isolated.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: The events of 13  November 2007 are forever etched in our memories. Even now, more than two years  later, it is difficult to comprehend how such a terrible tragedy could occur.  The tragic events have had a tremendous impact on the community in Omagh and,  in particular, on the families and friends of the victims, who will have to  live with the grief for the rest of their lives. I am sure that I speak for all  Members when I say that they are in our thoughts and prayers.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, I  have a shared responsibility for the issue with other Ministers, given that the  Western Trust was one of a number of key agencies involved with the  McElhill/McGovern family. Early on, I recognised the need for an inquiry, which  is why, in January 2008, I appointed Henry Toner to investigate the role of the  health and social care agencies that were involved with the family. Anyone who  has read the Toner report will recognise that the investigation into the role  that the health and social care agencies played with the McElhill/McGovern  family was extensive and thorough. It identified a number of deficiencies and  made 63 recommendations, 55 of which were directed at the Western Trust.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">For many people, including Members of the Assembly, today&rsquo;s  debate shows that there remains the belief that there are unanswered questions  regarding those events. Seven people died at Lammy Crescent. In the minds of many  people, for something so terrible to have happened, someone must be to blame  and someone should be punished.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Coroner concluded that, on the balance of  probabilities, Arthur McElhill and Lorraine McGovern had been up all night. She  also concluded that Lorraine McGovern was about to leave and take some of her  children with her when the fire was started by Arthur McElhill. All seven  members of the family died as a result of the inhalation of fire fumes.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I recognise that there is a significant issue in relation  to public confidence, which is why I asked Mr Toner to return to the Western  Trust. His role will be to confirm that all of the recommendations in his  original report have been implemented, and I expect his findings to be with me  by the end of March 2010. Toner&rsquo;s original report identified a number of  deficiencies in the performance of social services in particular in the Western  Trust area. However, Henry Toner also concluded that there was no evidence that  any of those health agencies could have anticipated that the tragic events of  13 November 2007 were about to occur. He said that no reasonable person could  have predicted those tragic events.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The protection of children is a key priority for me and for  all of us here. The events at Lammy    Crescent reinforce what we already know, which is  that, overwhelmingly, children come to harm at the hands of people in their own  family and friends of the family. We also know that a number of factors are  often present in child protection cases, including domestic violence, substance  misuse and mental health problems. To some extent, all of those issues appear  to have been present in this case. The other major factor is deprivation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In Northern    Ireland today, 100,000 children live in  poverty, 40,000 live in households where there is substance misuse, 11,000 live  in families where they witness domestic violence on a daily basis, and many  thousands of adults and children across society suffer from depression and  other forms of mental health problems. Day and daily, social workers and other  healthcare professionals are out there on the ground helping families and  children to deal with those issues. Overall, they do an excellent job in  extremely difficult circumstances. I am tired of hearing unfair criticism of  the dedicated professionals who deal with extremely difficult and sensitive  cases. We must never forget the thousands of cases where the intervention of  social workers prevented children from coming to harm. Recent research has  shown a 38% drop in the number of violent and unexplained deaths of children in  England and Wales, and we  operate the same system here. Social workers in Northern Ireland continue to make a  real difference in the lives of children and families every single day.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Even if we had the best resourced and most effective service  in the world, it would be impossible to ensure that no child or adult would  ever come to harm. As Minister, I have sought to target additional resources at  child protection, mental health services, domestic violence, substance misuse,  and sexual violence. Despite that, those services remain comparatively  under-resourced, compared to the rest of the United Kingdom.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The inquiry into the role of health and social services in  the tragic events at Lammy    Crescent identified the lessons that had to be  learned.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">1.30 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is not for me alone to decide whether a public inquiry  should be held. Social services were only one of the agencies involved with the  McGovern/McElhill family. The Northern Ireland Office and the police were also  monitoring Arthur McElhill as a sex offender. I would not support a public  inquiry into the tragedy unless I genuinely believed that it would reveal  previously unknown information.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Henry Toner and his team produced an extremely detailed  report, which clearly identified failings on the part of social services and  other agencies in the Western Trust area. They also made several  recommendations in relation to those failings. As a result, and on the basis of  actions arising from those areas for which I have responsibility, no substantive  grounds exist for holding a public inquiry into the tragedy. Furthermore, all  Members should be mindful of the distressing effect that a public inquiry would  have on both families, because of the ongoing and significant media interest in  the case. The costs of a public inquiry would have to be met from budgets that  are already under pressure. However, if I believed that a public inquiry would  address any unanswered questions, and if the Northern Ireland Office and the  police felt that an inquiry was required, I would support it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">All our efforts must be aimed at minimising the risk of  such terrible events occurring in the future. However, to enable us to protect  children and vulnerable adults to the best of our ability, those services must  be properly resourced. If any Member seriously believes that the latest  proposed &pound;113 million cut in the health and social services budgets will not  have a negative impact on those services, he or she is badly mistaken.  Historically, family and children&rsquo;s services in Northern   Ireland have been under-resourced by some 30% compared  with the rest of the UK.  Those are not my figures; they were provided by the Department of Finance and  Personnel and OFMDFM. I inherited that situation, but the demand for social  services has not ceased. Indeed, it continues to grow, and during the past five  years, the number of children referred to social services has increased by  almost one third.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">For the past two and a half years, I have been warning the  Assembly about the dangers of underfunding health and social care. As the  Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, I have increased  spending on services for children by 14%. That has not eradicated the  underfunding of those services, but at least I have attempted to close the gap.  That historical underfunding is also the reason why the Department has driven  forward improvements. Recently, for example, I secured &pound;3&middot;5 million of  additional recurrent funding to help in the recruitment of around 70 more front  line social services posts. That extra staffing compliment includes about 30  posts at principal practitioner, social worker, senior practitioner and team  leader levels in front line child protection and family intervention teams, and  it will, effectively, result in an extra team for each trust. However, those  investments are now under threat.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In line with a key Toner recommendation, further posts will  be created to assist with public protection arrangements and to enable trusts  to discharge their role in monitoring sex offenders. The Department is, for  example, funding pilot initiatives that will place social workers in police  units in each trust area: the police are not funding that, health and social  services are. Those social workers will work closely with the police on  improving communication and intervention to help child and adult victims.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Family intervention teams play a crucial role in helping  families in need to address problems before they lead to child protection  concerns. Those teams undertake more detailed assessments and work with  children and families in need, and the majority of the new posts are likely to  be in those teams, which also have the most unallocated cases.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Child protection services are in the midst of a substantial  and ongoing reform programme to introduce improved assessments of children in  need and to ensure that better services are delivered. That programme will  address several key weaknesses that were identified by child protection  inspections and inquiries into cases, such as the McGovern/McElhill tragedy, in  which children died or came to serious harm.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The reform programme includes the introduction of a single  assessment tool for children; common standards of supervision for front line  staff and recording of files and key documents; improved information sharing;  common thresholds of need and intervention; common organisational structures  across trusts; a pilot scheme to monitor social workers&rsquo; caseloads; and new  arrange&shy;ments to embed those standards and guidance into undergraduate training  at Northern Ireland&rsquo;s two universities. We also continue to monitor closely the  number of unallocated cases in health and social care trusts. Trusts have  received investment to help to reduce those cases, and we will continue to  monitor that to see what additional actions may be necessary.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I know that, despite that, much more needs to be done. I  worry about the level of resourcing that I have been able to deploy into all  those services. I can only imagine how much more difficult it is for  professionals working on the ground with families and children who desperately  need help and support. On previous occasions I have said that, as an Assembly  and an Executive, we must be mature about the difficult choices that we face.  How we invest in and protect our children speaks volumes to the outside world  about the type of Government that we are and about the sort of country that  this is and what we hope it to be in the future. We need to look for  opportunities when they arise to try to make things better.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am awaiting Henry Toner&rsquo;s follow-up report, and I fully  expect that to provide assurance that actions have been taken to fully  implement all his recommendations in the Western Trust. Members have asked  about the outstanding issues that are being worked on in the Department. We still  have to complete the child-protection guidance, but that is awaiting the new  child-protection arrangements that will be introduced later this year, which  will help to inform the final part of that work. The other outstanding  recommendation for the trust is the timely distribution of minutes, which  relates to ensuring that minutes of meetings are properly shared among the  other agencies. Members have made important points about sharing across  agencies in the field of health and social care for which I have a  responsibility. That has been one of my key priorities, and the Toner report  provides the blueprint and format for that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That is where we are as far as the Health Service is  concerned. I believe that I have taken all reasonable steps in the area of  health and social care. However, if the Assembly votes in favour of the motion,  I will write to the First Minister and deputy First Minister to ask them to  raise the issue with the Secretary of State.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank Members for taking part in  the debate and also for being mindful of the sensitivities around it. I hope  that it has been made clear, through the contributions of members of the Health  Committee and local representatives, that no one wants an inquiry simply to  rake over old ground or to reopen wounds that were beginning to heal. As a  Committee, we are very aware that it is not only the families that have been  affected but the wider community. We have heard from senior social workers who  have been incredibly stressed by events, as well as from local GPs who have  evidence of the stress that people in the local community have been under.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee is aware of the number of reviews and reports  carried out on the events in question, all of which have been useful and have  led to lessons being learned. However, it believes that more could be done and  that all the reviews and reports have missed one very important area: how did  all the agencies that were involved work together and communicate? The  Committee believes that lessons can be learned about that. Inter-agency working  is difficult, wherever the setting, but the issue concerns children&rsquo;s lives,  and the better that that inter-agency working is done, the better the  protection that we can offer children.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion calls for an inquiry into the multi-agency  aspects of the tragedy: that must be underlined. The Committee believes that  that can be done without unnecessarily raking up events of the past. Members  have spoken about cost. The Committee does not want to see an expensive inquiry  that runs and runs. It has to be time bound and focused, and it has to consider  the multi-agency aspects and how they work together. The Committee is aware  that other agencies involved in such an inquiry are likely to be the PSNI, the  Probation Board and the Prison Service.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We are aware that a case review took place on the inter-agency  handling of Arthur McElhill as a registered sex offender. That review was  commissioned by the sex offender strategic management committee and involved  those agencies.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee is also aware that it is not within the remit  of the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety to establish  such an inquiry, but the Minister can ask the Secretary of State to initiate a  review, and we call on him to do so. I welcome the positive comments that the  Minister made at the end of his contribution when he said that if the House  were to vote in favour of the motion, he would talk to OFMDFM about making that  contact and taking the matter forward.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will now turn to Members&rsquo; contributions during the  debate. Pat Doherty spoke about the sensitivities of the families and of the  local area, and he said that he had spoken to both families. Pat has spoken to  many of the relevant agencies, and he believes that there is a lack of cohesion  among those who work in child protection. He feels that more needs to be done  and that a public inquiry is warranted.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">John McCallister does not believe that a public inquiry is  necessary. He said that the Toner report was wide-ranging and independent and  that it covered all the agencies that were involved. The Committee does not  dispute the findings of the Toner report, but we believe that lessons need to  be learned in collective working, and we want the inquiry to focus on that. Mr  McCallister recognised that during the handling of the case and leading up to  the tragedy, mistakes were made, such as the fact that it was not ensured that  case conferences happened. He said that the Toner report dealt with those  mistakes and that an inquiry would serve no purpose. The Committee disputes  that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Dolores Kelly offered condolences to the family, welcomed  the lessons that were learned from the Toner inquiry and the Watkins inquiry  and paid tribute to the social services staff, who work in difficult  conditions. The Minister referred to the unfair criticism of healthcare  professionals in social services. The Committee is not for one minute  suggesting that those staff should be criticised. We recognise that they do  difficult work in difficult conditions. The Committee is not about bashing  those staff. Dolores said that the lack of investment in social services was  disappointing, and she questioned whether the additional &pound;20 million promised  for social care was recycled money or new money.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Sean Neeson said that the community in Omagh had been  affected by the 1998 bomb, and he talked about the effect that this tragedy had  on the Lammy area. He said that the terrible incident might never have happened  if the warning signs had been heeded. Obviously, we cannot suggest that the  tragedy would not have happened, but if proper and improved inter-agency work  had been taken forward, at least we could have been more sure that the proper  procedures had been applied. Mr Neeson supported the motion, but he said that  any inquiry should be neither lengthy nor costly.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Thomas Buchanan supported the motion and said that lessons  needed to be learned to prevent future tragedies. He welcomed the Toner  report&rsquo;s recommendations and asked the Minister to maintain pressure on  agencies to make improvements. I welcome the fact that the Western Trust has  implemented 53 of the 55 recommendations in the Toner report, but we want  improvement in multi-agency working.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Claire McGill, who represents the area, said that the case  is complex and has many aspects. She said that the Toner report and the Watkins  report looked at those aspects, and she commended the Western Trust for implementing  Toner&rsquo;s recommendations, for recognising that mistakes were made and for its  willingness to learn from them. Mistakes include misconceptions of the role of  other agencies and lack of inter-agency working, and we need to get to the  bottom of that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Tommy Gallagher referred to the great hurt and pain of the  families and the communities, but he is not entirely convinced of the need for  a public inquiry. He has listened to the public, who were concerned that money  spent on an inquiry could be better spent on child protection. Perhaps Tommy  misunderstood me when he thought that the Committee was going to conduct an  inquiry into child protection. Just to clear the matter up, we are considering  a new piece of legislation on safeguarding.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Basil McCrea said that local politicians have a level of  oversight for the PSNI. The PSNI has told me that its decision-making protocols  would not have changed. Members of the public have suggested that the  improvements that have been put in place are not working, but the message must  be sent clearly to the public that we are taking the issue of child protection  seriously and that we want to improve inter-agency working. Although individual  agencies might have done their jobs, they did not do that collectively.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">1.45 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I now turn to the Minister&rsquo;s comments. He said that  responsibility for this is not down to him alone, and the Committee accepts  that other agencies need to step up and take responsibility. The Minister said  that he has done all that he can in asking the Toner inquiry to go back to the  Western Trust and to provide him with an update on how the recommendations have  been taken forward. We obviously welcome that, but we believe that all the  other agencies need to take responsibility. We need to minimise risk, and that  is what the Committee aims to do. Nobody can say for sure that an event like  this will never be repeated. However, we must be confident that we have taken  forward all the measures that we can to ensure that best practice is in place  and that people work more efficiently together. We welcome all the improvements  that have taken place in the Western Trust and across the board in the  Department.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We fully recognise the difficulties that professionals face  in doing their job. The Minister talked about public confidence &mdash; that is what  today&rsquo;s Committee motion is about. We want to ensure that there is public  confidence in all the agencies that are involved in child protection. Child  protection is a key priority for every Member in the House, including the  Minister.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As I said earlier, the Minister talked about unfair  criticism. I want to again put on record &mdash; I said this when I proposed the  motion &mdash; that I commend the good work of the social services, because, quite  often, that work goes unrecognised. The Minister said that the tragedy might  not have been prevented, even if the best resources or systems had been in  place at the time, and, of course, we agree with that. However, we need to be  confident that we have taken all the steps and precautions that we possibly  can, because this tragic event cannot be allowed to be repeated. We must be  sure that we take all possible steps to improve systems and practice, and  multi-agency working needs to be improved to maximise any chance of that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s closing remarks that he will write  to OFMDFM to ask that it raise the issue of the way forward with the Secretary  of State. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That this Assembly calls on the Minister of Health,  Social Services and Public Safety to seek to secure the agreement of the  Secretary of State to initiate a time-bound public inquiry into the  multi-agency aspects of the McElhill/McGovern tragedy in Omagh.</p>

      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30  minutes for the debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes in  which to propose and 10 minutes in which to make a winding-up speech. All other  Members who wish to speak will have five minutes.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That this Assembly notes the need for newbuild and  ongoing maintenance to ensure provision of a schools estate fit for the  twenty-first century; recognises the additional economic benefit of  construction industry job creation; and calls on the Minister of Education and  the Minister of Finance and Personnel to ensure that a procurement mechanism is  in place, which expedites the provision of capital projects, and that adequate  funds are provided to maintain our schools to the highest possible standards.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm  an r&uacute;n seo a mholadh.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased to propose the motion to the House. It was  tabled at a time when we were not aware of the swingeing cuts that all  Departments now face. At that time, we knew about the huge backlog in schools  maintenance that amounts to about &pound;240 million. That amount is equivalent to a  host of new primary and secondary schools, and it clearly points to the poor  state of the schools estate.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister says that she is aiming to create a  world-class education system. How can we have a world-class education system  when the schools estate is evidently in need of so much repair? Some will argue  that it is not the school buildings that count but the quality of the teaching  and learning that take place within them. However, if Members speak to teachers  in recently refurbished or newbuild schools, they will hear about the clear,  positive effects of modern, up-to-date facilities for the pupils and staff,  and, indeed, for the way in which those schools are viewed in the local  community.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Some teachers have to work in outdated and outmoded  buildings with facilities that have long been in need of replacement. Past  pupils, who have long left school, say that newbuild and refurbishment were  promised during their school days, only to come to nothing.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The procurement process for newbuilds is extremely  frustrating for education providers, staff, parents and pupils. Usually, dates  are given and projections are made, only for those to be dishonoured and  delayed by further bureaucratic stalling. Not only are newbuilds slow at coming  on stream but basic, badly needed repairs are not being done and are piling up,  year on year. The longer that repairs are left undone, the more the schools  estate deteriorates and the worse the conditions in which children and teachers  have to work. The longer that maintenance is delayed, the greater the bill will  be. Lack of investment now is a false economy, and, in the long term, the cost  will be even greater.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We are told that further pressures on this year&rsquo;s education  budget mean that no newbuilds will go on site in 2010-11. At least, that is  what senior officials from the Department of Education (DE) told the Committee  on several occasions. However, what they tell us varies, to some extent, from  what the Minister tells us. On Wednesday 3 February, the Minister appeared  before the Committee for Education, and she said that that is not the case and  that, depending on the outcome of the ongoing strategic review, there may be  some newbuilds during the coming year. Such mixed messages emanating from the  Department are frustrating and disappointing for the teachers, pupils and  parents associated with schools, such as those in my constituency &mdash; in Forkill,  Drumantine, Maddan, Carrick, and so on &mdash; which were promised that their  newbuild would be on site in spring 2010. They want to know whether that is  true, but the messages from the Department are mixed: &ldquo;no&rdquo; from the officials  but &ldquo;maybe&rdquo; from the Minister.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Many Members are aware of similar situations in their  constituencies, and they will also be disappointed that no building work will  be done in the coming year. That is largely due to a &pound;22 million cutback in the  Department&rsquo;s capital budget, alongside a &pound;52 million reduction in the  Department&rsquo;s resource budget.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">On 14 January 2010, the Minister kindly wrote to the  Committee:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;to obtain the views of the Education Committee on how  we can deliver these savings and address pressures within the overall context  of my priorities for education.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A cynic might say that the Minister is quite willing to  invite the Committee to help her to make cuts but that, when money was  available for investment, she was happy to do that without the Committee&rsquo;s  help.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister and her officials outlined five areas in which  savings can be made to make up for the shortfall in resources. Those include  reductions in bureaucracy in C2k, the CCEA, the entitlement framework and the  school improvement programme.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">All those issues are associated with the resource budget,  but we have no detailed information on the Minister&rsquo;s plans for the capital  resource. We know that her Department would need in the region of &pound;70 million  to progress the 100 or so schemes that are still in the pipeline. Under present  economic conditions, that resource will not be available.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We need to know the results of the strategic review of the  capital programme that the Minister has undertaken. Schools that are awaiting  projects will expect to know where they stand, and it is important that there  be a clear and transparent process. Having already received mixed messages from  the Department, I would like the Minister to tell us what lies in store for the  new school building programme. Is the review finished? If not, when will it be  finished? What criteria will she use to determine the projects that will go  ahead and those that will not? The Minister may wish to tell us how much  resource she intends to set aside for minor works and for much needed  maintenance respectively. Those are very important areas, especially at a time  of slowdown in capital spend.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">After the High Court ruling on the schools modernisation  framework agreement for tendering procedures, which was originally aimed at  expediting new school builds, will the Minister tell us what her Department is  doing to accelerate the procurement process? It is important that we get an  answer to that question.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As we all know, the education and skills authority (ESA)  was originally designed to save &pound;20 million a year, which would go to front  line services. Some of the money that was originally intended for the ESA has  had to be submitted to the Department of Finance and Personnel because of  delays. I am sure that that has had a knock-on effect in other budget areas.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Once again, I remind the House of how important it is that  our teachers and pupils work and learn in the best possible facilities. That is  not the case at present, and, with an outstanding bill for maintenance of &pound;240  million, it is imperative that we continue to invest in the schools estate in  order to aim to have the best possible facilities available to our children and  to our teachers. Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leat, a LeasCheann Comhairle, as an deis seo  a thabhairt domh labhairt ar an &aacute;bhar seo.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education (Mr Storey)</strong>: The Committee receives regular  briefings on the education budget from senior officials in the Department of  Education. On 18 November 2009, the Committee questioned departmental officials  on how the &pound;70 million capital requirement for 2010-11 would be addressed. The  Committee also asked how further additional efficiencies in the Executive&rsquo;s  spending plans for 2010-11, which amount to some &pound;22 million of capital  pressure or 11&middot;5% of the 2010-11 educational capital budget, would be found. As  Mr Bradley mentioned, the question of the &pound;240 million deficit in the  maintenance budget also arose.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In their response, departmental officials said that the  Minister was reviewing capital expenditure plans and that information would be  available to the Committee early in 2010. The Committee then heard from the  officials that, in the absence of any additional capital funding, the  Department of Education would not release any further new capital projects into  2010-11 and would cease work on bringing new projects into the process.  However, the Minister seemed to be at variance with her officials on that issue  when she met the Committee last week, and we would appreciate it if she could  provide clarity to the House today on that issue.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee was also concerned about a specific DE  briefing on the Department&rsquo;s capital spending programme at its meeting on 9  December. It confirmed the serious position of the capital programme, which  will be restricted in 2010-11 to minor works spend that is needed to meet  statutory requirements. The Committee reaffirmed its request for information on  the Minister&rsquo;s review of the capital programme. Moreover, the Committee had  serious concerns when it was informed of the &pound;240 million backlog of requests  for maintenance from schools.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee received a letter dated 14 January 2010 from  the Minister setting out the Executive draft proposals and plans for 2010-11,  which identified &pound;22 million in capital expenditure reductions. However, the  letter proposed no measures to address the problem or to highlight the serious  position of the education capital programme in 2010-11. That was a serious  deficiency in the correspondence. Furthermore, the Committee has received no  information on the Minister&rsquo;s review of the education capital programme, even  though it asked officials in December to provide the criteria for selection of  capital projects and any proposed outcomes. The Committee understands and is  concerned that the Minister is reviewing the capital programme on the basis of  how projects fit with her policies on area-based planning and the entitlement  framework.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will now move to issues that I have as a Member of the  House. I declare my membership of the board of governors of Ballymoney High School.  I urgently need an assurance from the Minister that there will be movement on  capital projects in 2010-11. In my constituency, Ballymoney High School  has been waiting for six years, and as the proposer of the motion said, I hope  that the Minister will not target schools on the basis of non-compliance with  her priorities.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We are not here about the priorities of an individual  Minister; we should be here about the priorities for education in Northern Ireland.  Therefore, it is totally unacceptable that this Minister is overseeing a review  of capital build programmes, yet has not informed the Education Committee, to  date, about the criteria that she is using. The Minister told the Committee  that the information will be disclosed at the appropriate time, which will be  after she has made the decisions and has choreographed the estate in the  education system to create losers instead of winners. I want the Minister to  tell the House what the situation at Ballymoney  High School is today, and what is  happening with the capital programme for Ballycastle High School,  which is held up as an example of cross-community collaboration?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member should bring his remarks to a close.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: Finally, will the Minister bring to the  House a decision about &#8213;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Time is up.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: &#8213; Garryduff  Primary School outside the village of Dunloy &#8213;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Time is up.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: &#8213; in my constituency, which has been  waiting for seven years &#8213;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I call Mr John O&rsquo;Dowd.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Ba mhaith liom tac&uacute; leis an r&uacute;n.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion. It would be difficult for anyone to  speak against the intent of the motion, which calls for more finance for a  school build programme and for a procurement policy for a build programme. We  are all aware that the previous procurement procedures were challenged  successfully in the courts and had to be revised. That caused a considerable  delay to building projects across the North.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is not surprising that MLAs will rise to speak about  schools in their constituencies, because many schools across all constituencies  require newbuilds or major renovation works to ensure that our children are  taught in a welcoming, safe and open environment.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have looked jealously at some of the schools that I have  visited across the North, especially Holy   Cross College  in Strabane, which opened recently. Anyone who visits that school can only be  impressed by the facilities that are available to its pupils, and I wish them  all the best for the future.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the education debate. Observers of the debate  might come to the view that nothing else matters in education other than the  transfer procedure, having listened to the media and certain politicians who,  when they make their single transferable speech on education, are referring to  the 11-plus and can offer no broader policy proposals beyond that issue. Today&rsquo;s  debate is refreshing from that point of view.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: Would it not be advisable that the Member  inform the Minister that, when it comes to devising policies on capital, she  should take the transfer procedure out of the equation? It is obvious that she  is judging schools on the merits of a policy that is based on transfer 2010.  That does have something to do with the transfer procedure. While I am on my  feet, I congratulate the children who, at the weekend, received the results  that prove that academic selection is here to stay.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  often speak to the Minister about many issues and will continue to do so.  Surely all Departments are run on the basis of policy. I would be shocked if,  for instance, DETI was being run on policies to which its Minister did not  adhere. It is foolish to suggest that Departments are not being run according  to their existing policies.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I add my congratulations to the children who sat the tests  and got their results at the weekend, regardless of what those results were. I  wish all the children who are transferring to post-primary schools in the  autumn the best of luck in their educational future, regardless of whether they  sat a test.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We are now entering the realm of what the public call bread-and-butter  politics. As local politicians, we will have to make some difficult decisions  in the months and years ahead. The recent Budget cuts that were agreed by the  Executive are only the beginning of a hard fiscal period for the Assembly and  for society as a whole. If we are to continue to table motions on spending, we  must craft them in a way that suits our political train of thought and offers  viable and credible fiscal alternatives. That is where the debate is going and  where the general public expect us as politicians &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Just give me one second, Dolores.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The general public expect that we, as politicians, will  ensure that in tabling motions we offer an alternative. All Ministers could  stand up and do what Margaret Ritchie does &mdash; I congratulate Margaret on her  election as leader of the SDLP &mdash; all Ministers can stand up and say that they  cannot do their job because they need more money. That rhetoric is no longer  satisfactory. We have to plan a way forward with the limited fiscal capacity  that we have.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Will the Member outline why Sinn F&eacute;in is not challenging its partners in the  DUP to open the books on the Budget and the Programme for Government? In light  of the difficult economic climate, will they have a real look at this year&rsquo;s  Budget and Programme for Government?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  If the Member for Upper Bann checks, she will discover that Margaret Ritchie is  not only the leader of the SDLP but a member of the Executive. The Executive  discussed in detail the required &pound;300 million of savings and the Programme for  Government and agreed the Budget in detail. All Statutory Committees, including  the Committee that is chaired by the Member, are scrutinising Budget bids by  their respective Departments. It is not Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s fault if the Member has not  seen the Budget; it is her own fault. Even as a Committee Chairperson, she  should be analysing in detail the Department of the Environment&rsquo;s budget. If  she is not, she should be asking serious questions of her fellow Committee  members.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Back to the point in hand &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  have only a few moments left.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the motion but, if we are to move forward in  serious political debate and offer alternatives, not only should we table  motions &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member must draw his remarks to a close.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Members must table motions that outline how those alternatives can happen.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  It has really surprised me that no one has been talking about education over  the past week. We have been at Hillsborough talking about parades, policing and  justice, a new future and how we are all going to get on together so much  better. Yet no one has mentioned education.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As Mr O&rsquo;Dowd said, this is real politics. We are in one  unholy mess. Last year &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Will the Member accept that Reg Empey, who is a party colleague of his, is the  Minister responsible for further and higher education? If education is in a  mess, that is an indictment of his own colleague.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  It is always good to hear from the honourable Member on the opposite Benches,  and it is good to hear that he is as entertaining as usual. I am not sure what  point he is making, but thanks anyway, Barry.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The issue comes along &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. Once again, I ask Members to make their remarks through the  Chair. If it continues, I will name the Member and ask him to go.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The question comes back to education. I am keen to debate  education. I am keen to work out why we were able to spend &pound;250 million on  capital projects last year and why we will spend nothing in this incoming year.  Decisions have to be made. I also want to know why we do not have &pound;100 million  for revenue budgets. I want to discuss those issues.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for Education receives presentations from  departmental officials giving it those facts. However, the facts are then  apparently countermanded by the Minister, meaning that all we get is confusion.  It is not possible to talk about these matters sensibly if we do not have the  proper information.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I have only five minutes in which to speak.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: Mr O&rsquo;Dowd&rsquo;s logic says that we should help  to identify problems. His own Minister sent the Committee for Education a  letter asking it to help the Department to identify problems. It is, therefore,  obvious that even the Minister does not know what she wants to do about the  education cuts that have to be made.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Mr Bradley will make the winding-up speech, so I am sorry that I cannot take  his intervention.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with Mr Storey. This is what the people of Northern  Ireland are talking about. They want to know what is happening to our schools.  Many of the schools in which our children are taught are substandard. We have  to make some arrangement whereby we continue to replace schools that are below  the necessary standard, and, if we have to, we must make the appropriate hard  decisions. That means some form of closure of schools that are, perhaps, not in  the right place. Certainly, we have to recognise that we want to ensure that  everyone has equality of opportunity. If we are to make those hard decisions,  we have to get together. It is not possible for one of us to come forward,  whether that is the Minister or someone else, and say that they will deal with  the matter in their way and that no one else is to be involved.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am struck by Mr O&rsquo;Dowd&rsquo;s admonishment that we will have  to look for a way to find the money. The next motion on the Order Paper, which  is about a health issue and which Mr O&rsquo;Dowd&rsquo;s party tabled, calls for precisely  what he is telling us not to do. He is telling us not to come forward with  proper plans. That is exactly the point. Perhaps the Member should reflect on  that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The issue comes down to how we deal with the finance. We  need to take a long, hard look at where waste and inefficiencies exist in the  system. We understand that the money is not there. I was not sure whether I  could support the motion, given that it calls for money that we know is not  there. However, we must find a way forward and do something for the sake of our  children and investment in the future.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">To that end, can we not, please, remove all the confusion,  unacceptable delay, prevarication and inquiries? Nobody really knows whether  certain schools will be built. A long list was issued years ago, and we do not  know whether those schools will be built. That is unacceptable, it is cruel,  and it is not fair. Those are all the things that politicians should not be  doing. We must bring some form of clarity. I make this pledge: the Ulster  Unionist Party will respond sensitively and appropriately in trying to work out  a solution for all people in Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that the Minister will speak about ESA, but my  party supports it, provided that its purpose is to streamline and improve  efficiencies. We had a problem with ESA when it became a super-quango that was  going to tell everyone what to do. If those issues are addressed, we will  support it. Finally, when we consider cross-party working groups, such as those  dealing with the transfer issue, why will Sinn F&eacute;in not join us? We have had  working groups left, right and centre on the efficiency of the Executive, on  trying to &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Bring your remarks to a close, please.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Why not have a working party on education?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Your time is up.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Why will Sinn F&eacute;in not work with the rest of us for the benefit of all the people  of Northern Ireland?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: A  quieter contribution is coming up. I support the motion. Even John O&rsquo;Dowd  agrees that we should support it. The need for newbuilds and ongoing  maintenance of schools is self-evident. If one were to ask the head teacher of  Lagan College if she needs a newbuild, she would say that the school would  probably have to fall down before it is rebuilt. If one were to ask in  Magherafelt, one would be told that a new school has been promised and will not  go ahead. If one is looking for a maintenance example, one could talk to a head  teacher on the Springfield Road who regards himself now as more a plumber and  electrician than a head teacher.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I notice that the motion refers to a procurement mechanism  to expedite the provision of capital projects. That is fair enough: we should  have a good, efficient procurement mechanism. However, if it were speeded up at  the moment, it would probably make things worse, because it would mean that  more projects were coming forward with even less money to provide for them. If  the strategic review turns a &ldquo;maybe&rdquo; into a possibility of one newbuild, that  will probably be the height of it. The backlog of maintenance work required is  critical and is getting worse. It is bound to get worse.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson of  the Committee for Education</strong>: An example was highlighted to me the other day  in which a school needs repairs done to windows, but, in order to spend the  money before 31 March, they are tarmacking the yard at the back to provide  additional car parking spaces. That shows that the Minister is not even in  control of the processes that she governs.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: The  maintenance budget deficit of &pound;240 million can only get worse. If I remember  correctly, the &pound;30 million expenditure figure this year has been reduced from  &pound;90 million, which might have made a dent in the problem. Trying to pay off  &pound;240 million at &pound;30 million a year will not get easier. That figure of &pound;240  million will probably rise. However, it is not a new problem. At the risk of  appearing to defend the current Minister, I will say that this has been going  on under direct rule and under the previous Minister. It is a cumulative  situation, which has now come to a head.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: No,  I have already given way once. All right; I will. Go ahead.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I thank the Member very much. The whole point of devolved administration was  that we would have control of our own affairs and make a difference to people  on the ground. It is a failure of devolved administration if we cannot get that  right.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>:  Getting a handle on our own affairs would be all very well if we also had  control of our own money. However, the money coming through is being reduced,  not increased.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  Wait until the Tories get their hands on it.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  You would put up our own taxes, Kieran.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>:  Every Department wants to get something out of the money that is coming  through, and every Department has to take a cut this year. It is not a new  problem, and it is hardly a surprise that we are faced with this situation. The  only way to solve it, and I find myself agreeing with Basil McCrea occasionally  &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Steady now.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: I  know.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McAllister</strong>:  Resign. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: It  needs to be &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I hope that it is a point of order.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  I hope it is too. A conversation seems to be taking place involving several  Members in sedentary positions.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: It is not a point of order. However, I am pleased that the Member  made that point, because I have been trying to do so. Some Members are overcome  by their own verbosity.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: Mr  Deputy Speaker, I am heartily glad that Mr McElduff made that point. If you  stood here and tried to speak on a regular basis, you would realise just how  difficult it can be.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Anyway, I will try to return to the issue. We need to  tackle the problem at its source. We need to have a proper go at dealing with  the entire issue of area-based planning rather than just tinkering with it. We  need to look at the issue of sustainable schools: there are too many sectors,  too many empty desks and too many systems. I am pointing towards the ESA. I  hope that the outbreak of goodwill which seemed to occur on Friday like some  sort of miracle will be extended.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that the working group that will look at the  business that has been stuck in the Executive logjam will speedily clear the  way for a proper discussion about the ESA, because that is the vehicle that  could produce efficiency. In addition to the &pound;20 million saving through its own  operation, it could help to bring about a root-and-branch review of the entire  system to try to make some sense of the situation. I am also glad to hear that  the Ulster Unionists appear to support the ESA again. Their support has been on  and off, but I am glad that it is on again, even if it is subject to caveats  and restrictions.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Will the Member take an intervention?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: I  am finished, Basil, so you will not be able to make an intervention.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  I support the motion. It asks us to recognise the additional economic benefit  of construction industry job creation. The economic downturn has had a  devastating impact on jobs, particularly in the construction industry. The  construction industry accounts for 44% &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. A complaint was made recently about conversations. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.] </span>I am sure that the Member will bear that in  mind. I apologise, Miss McIlveen. Continue.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  The construction industry accounted for 44% of the rise in unemployment in  December 2009. According to DETI claimant count figures, 13,245 claimants came  from the construction sector. As a response to that problem, I understand that  the Executive&rsquo;s gross capital investment during 2009-2010 will be in excess of  &pound;1&middot;7 billion, which is an unprecedented level of government investment. I am  referring to the parts of the motion that have not yet been addressed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I understand that the Minister of Finance and Personnel and  his predecessor have been working alongside construction industry stakeholders  to address concerns relating to improving opportunities for small and  medium-sized enterprises to access public procurement and information regarding  future government construction works and services. Such measures would go some  way to addressing the concerns expressed in the motion about a procurement  mechanism and the expedition of capital projects from the point of view of DFP.  However, the relevant Departments must provide information regarding capital  projects and the timing of those works.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am slightly disappointed in the motion. There is no doubt  that the Assembly will pass the motion, and, indeed, it will no doubt receive  unanimous support. From listening to the contributions to the debate, it is  obvious that Members recognise the need for newbuild schools and ongoing  maintenance at schools. I am sure that we are all united in our wish not only  to protect but to create jobs in our construction industry and that we all wish  that adequate funds were available for a host of things. In coming weeks, we  will no doubt see recurrent motions calling for various Departments to be given  adequate funds for a host of projects.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">What disappoints me about the motion is that it does not  address the fundamental issue: the Minister&rsquo;s handling of her Budget. As we  have heard, schools around Northern    Ireland have been earmarked for newbuilds  and extensions. Those are all at different stages and, previously, would have  been given an indication of when work would commence. However, given the  current financial situation, Members, the schools and the construction industry  do not know whether finance is available or when it might be made so. All those  groups need certainty about what is happening.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As has been mentioned, we have known for some time that  financial cuts are coming, and, since December, we have been made aware of how  severe they would be. In that same month, the Committee was told that there  would be a review of the capital programme, and we expected its results early  in the new year. We have yet to receive them.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has now decided that she will come to the  Committee and ask us where we think the axe should fall. Without doubt, she has  treated the Committee with contempt over the last two and a half years, and now  she asks us to provide cover for her. Perhaps we should not be so cynical;  perhaps we should see it as a new start for the Minister. She may be embarking  on a new path on which, in the future, she will be much more co-operative with  the Committee.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In a spirit of co-operation, I ask that the Minister  provide the clarity required by the Assembly, the schools and the builders.  Will she advise the Assembly of the criteria for her review of the capital  programme and of the results of that review? Will she tell the Assembly at  which of the schools earmarked for maintenance, newbuilds and extensions work  will proceed and at which work is placed on hold? Can she tell us how long the  projects put on hold will remain that way? Can she confirm that no new projects  will be commenced in 2010-11? Can she confirm that those projects already on  site will proceed? Can she reassure us that full equality impact assessments  have been or will be carried out in respect of decisions on whether projects  should proceed or be placed on hold?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s response to those  questions.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: As Question Time commences at 2.30 pm, I suggest that the House  takes its ease until that time. The debate will continue after Question Time, when  Mr Mitchel McLaughlin will be the next Member to speak.</p>

      <p class="H3SectionHeading">Office of the First Minister and deputy First  Minister</p>
      <p class="H4StageHeading">OFMDFM: Budget 2010-11</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mr G  Robinson </strong>asked the First Minister and deputy First Minister to outline  their 2010-11 budget.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 663/10<a name="AQO663/10" id="AQO663/10"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister (Mr M McGuinness)</strong>: In the 2008-2011 Budget, the Office of the  First Minister and deputy First Minister (OFMDFM) was allocated &pound;86&middot;4 million  of current expenditure and &pound;17&middot;3 million of capital for the 2010-2011 financial  year. On 12 January 2010 in the Assembly, the Finance Minister announced the  outcome of the Executive&rsquo;s review of their 2010-2011 spending plans. The  Executive&rsquo;s proposals, which were issued for consultation by the Finance  Minister, proposed a &pound;4&middot;1 million reduction in OFMDFM&rsquo;s resource allocation and  a &pound;5&middot;2 million reduction in its capital allocation for 2010-2011.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Subject to the outcome of the consultation exercise,  OFMDFM&rsquo;s revised budget allocations for 2010-11 will be &pound;82&middot;3 million of  current expenditure and &pound;12&middot;1 million of capital. We are considering a number  of options for delivering the budget reductions proposed in the Executive&rsquo;s  review of their 2010-2011 spending plans. The Committee for the Office of the  First Minister and deputy First Minister will be briefed on our proposals for  the delivery of the 2010-2011 budget reductions as soon as our considerations  are complete.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  Will the Minister indicate the implications for the number of staff in the  Department?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: It has implications, undoubtedly, but we are considering options  for delivering the additional savings agreed by the Executive for OFMDFM in the  review of their 2010-2011 spending plans. Following a bilateral meeting with  the Minister of Finance and Personnel on 19 November 2009 to discuss OFMDFM&rsquo;s  2010-2011 administration cost pressures, the First Minister and I agreed to  develop a robust plan to address those pressures through a reduction in the  Department&rsquo;s headcount.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The departmental restructuring plan will deliver  efficiencies of 51 OFMDFM full-time employees (FTEs), which will bring OFMDFM&rsquo;s  staffing level at 1 April 2010, or as soon as possible thereafter, to 314 FTEs.  The proposals will deliver estimated annual administration cost savings of &pound;2&middot;3  million. All OFMDFM staff have been advised of the staffing reductions in a  minute from the head of the Civil Service.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I am grateful for the opportunity to question the deputy First Minister. Will he  explain the absence of his Department&rsquo;s revised expenditure plans to the  Committee for the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister in  advance of tomorrow&rsquo;s plenary meeting?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: As I said earlier, we are considering a number of options for  delivering the budget reductions proposed in the Executive&rsquo;s review of their  2010-2011 spending plans. It includes an assessment of any impacts on our  obligations to promote equality, good relations and social inclusion.  Obviously, that takes time. I do not want to speculate on the potential impact  of the plans on any part of the Department until we have completed our  consideration of the issues and have briefed the OFMDFM Committee.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  Given that it appears that we are now moving with more certainty towards the  devolution of justice and policing, will the Minister confirm the budget line  for the proposed office of attorney general in the 2010-2011 budget plan? Will  he share with the Assembly and Executive Review Committee and the Committee for  the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister the report that he  and Peter Robinson received last September, nearly five months ago, about the  future shape and role of the attorney general&rsquo;s office &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member should come to his question.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  &mdash; so that all of us may be in a place to better understand what the devolution  of justice will look like when it comes?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: I am very pleased that the Member has adopted such a progressive  and constructive approach to the transfer of policing and justice powers. I do  not have the figures for the cost implications for the office of the attorney  general off the top of my head, but I will write to the Member with them.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: Last  month, the Department of Finance and Personnel (DFP) confirmed to me that it  has received almost &pound;1 million from the UK migration impacts fund for this  year, and I understand that the fund will run for a second year in 2010-11.  Will the Minister state whether any of that money was given to OFMDFM to help  those migrant workers who have no recourse to public funds? Will OFMDFM receive  any more money for next year?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: That will be part of an ongoing discussion between OFMDFM and  DFP. When we know the outcome of that discussion, we will write to the Member.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">Central Advertising Unit</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Ms  Purvis </strong>asked the First Minister and deputy First Minister how much was spent  by the central advertising unit on newspaper advertising in the last three  years; and whether competitive tendering practices are always followed to  ensure that the best possible price is obtained for such advertising.&nbsp; (AQO 664/10<a name="AQO664/10" id="AQO664/10"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: The central advertising unit holds figures for the amounts spent  on newspaper advertising by Departments, their agencies and non-departmental  public bodies. The total amounts for the past three years are &pound;8&middot;7 million for  2006-07, &pound;9&middot;6 million for 2007-08 and &pound;8&middot;4 million for 2008-09. That amounts to  more than &pound;26 million over the past three years on classified advertising &mdash;  public notices and recruitment &mdash; and campaign advertising.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The differing natures of the two types of advertising mean  that different approaches are required. A competitive tendering process that  was applied to classified advertising in 2006 resulted in a lengthy court  challenge by some newspapers. Given the level of expenditure and the ongoing  pressures on departmental budgets, we recently agreed to carry out an interim  review of the policy on classified advertising. That review, to be undertaken  by OFMDFM officials, will include some of the highest spending Departments,  with support from the Central Procurement Directorate.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The approach to campaign advertising is different. Competitive  rates for government have been negotiated with each of the main media  organisations. That approach now delivers improved value for money, with  incremental savings last year estimated at more than &pound;660,000.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">All aspects of the tendering process must comply with  procurement guidelines.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Purvis</strong>: I  thank the deputy First Minister for his answer. When will that interim review  on classified advertising be completed and published? Is a value-for-money review  of all government advertising planned?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: The review is ongoing. I do not have a date for its completion,  but we wish to expedite it. We are all conscious of the need to ensure that  public money is used properly. A tendering process was run for classified  advertising in daily newspapers. After the results became known, three local  newspapers combined in a legal challenge to stop its implementation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The case never came to judgement. As the length of time  that subsequently passed rendered rates and other marketplace data out of date,  the newspapers agreed to drop the case on the basis that the approach would be  re-examined. That re-examination is now under way.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Will the Minister outline the role of  the central advertising unit?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: The unit applies specialist expertise to improve the value for  money and effectiveness of advertising for all Departments. In 2008-09, the  unit cost &pound;398,000 to run and delivered savings of more than &pound;1 million. The  unit has 12 posts: nine in Belfast and three in Derry. Last year, the Derry  team handled almost 7,500 classified ads worth &pound;2&middot;6 million. It recently  achieved a 100% customer satisfaction rating across seven performance areas.  The Belfast  team delivered 18 advertising campaigns, each of which had clear objectives and  measures of effectiveness.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Will the deputy First Minister outline  how much was spent on the development of the Executive&rsquo;s website? In light of  its being virtually a replica of the Directgov website in the United Kingdom,  was there a tendering process?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: I do not have that information to hand, but we will write to the  Member with it.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">Child Poverty</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Mr  Butler </strong>asked the First Minister and deputy First Minister whether they plan  to use the Financial Assistance Act 2009 or to set up an Executive programme  fund to ensure that the Executive meet their targets in relation to child  poverty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 665/10<a name="AQO665/10" id="AQO665/10"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: With your permission, Mr Speaker, junior Minister Kelly will  answer that question.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister) (Mr G Kelly)</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. The tackling of poverty and  disadvantage is a priority in the Programme for Government, and it is a theme  that cuts across departmental boundaries. Child poverty is an integral part of  the overall work to tackle poverty and disadvantage, and specific child poverty  targets have been set in the Programme for Government. To ensure that resources  and efforts are directed to those in greatest need when allocating resources to  programmes, Departments are required, in line with normal public expenditure  guidelines, to consider available data and research on poverty, including child  poverty.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is the responsibility of the Executive subcommittee on  poverty and social inclusion to agree the priorities and the key Executive  actions that are necessary to meet child poverty targets. To that end,  Ministers have asked officials to work with colleagues from other Departments  to identify the priority actions that are required to benefit those groups,  including children who are in greatest objective need. The Executive subcommittee  on poverty and social inclusion is due to meet shortly to consider the outcomes  of those cross-departmental discussions and associated proposals for priority  action.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Once priorities are agreed by the Executive subcommittee,  it will be for the Executive to consider and decide how those priorities should  be implemented and resourced. In the Executive&rsquo;s considerations, they will  consider non-legislative options before legislative methods, such as the  Financial Assistance Act 2009.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Butler</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as an  fhreagra sin.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the junior Minister consider, through his good offices  on the subcommittee on children and young people and the subcommittee on  poverty and social inclusion, whether money in dormant bank accounts could be  used to create a dedicated fund to address child poverty?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr G Kelly)</strong>: We recognise that legislative proposals for dormant  bank accounts represent an opportunity for the Executive to target additional  resources at tackling social need through the Big Lottery Fund. We look forward  to the outcome of the Department of Finance and Personnel&rsquo;s consultation  process, which ended in October 2009.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>:  Has there been any progress in resolving the dispute between the Department of  Education and the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety about  school-age childcare, which the Committee for the Office of the First Minister  and deputy First Minister identified as one of the main barriers to people&rsquo;s  being economically active and, therefore, to their being able to lift their  families out of poverty?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr G Kelly)</strong>: We were due to meet the Committee for the Office of  the First Minister and deputy First Minister last week, and we will meet it  next week. I do not have precise information now, but we will have it when we  meet the Committee.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: To  ensure that any distribution of financial assistance funds is seen to be fair  and equitable, what steps and protocols has the Office of the First Minister  and deputy First Minister put in place to determine the relative priority of  each government programme that has suffered from cutbacks that inhibit the  achievement of preset targets?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr G Kelly)</strong>: To date, the Executive subcommittee has met on two  occasions, during which it reached conclusions about the agreed terms of reference.  In addition, it has been informed about the extent of poverty here, and it has  agreed the work that should be undertaken to identify the key co-ordinated  priority actions that are needed to benefit areas, groups and individuals,  particularly families and children in greatest objective need. We considered  and agreed initial proposals for a monitoring and reporting framework for the  Lifetime Opportunities strategy, which we adopted more than two years ago as  the overall architecture of our approach to poverty and social inclusion.  Furthermore, we agreed to the early re-establishment of the Minister-led  poverty and social inclusion stakeholder forum, which would be another  accountability mechanism.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The third meeting of the Executive&rsquo;s subcommittee is due to  be held shortly. The meeting that was scheduled for 17 December 2009 was  cancelled due to an extended Executive meeting. A new date is to be agreed. At  that meeting, Ministers will consider further proposals on priority action  areas, as well as the monitoring and reporting of a framework for lifetime  opportunities.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">Promoting Social Inclusion: Disability</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mr  Hilditch </strong>asked the First Minister and deputy First Minister how the report  of the promoting social inclusion working group on disability will be taken  forward.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 666/10<a name="AQO666/10" id="AQO666/10"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: On 3 December 2009, the promoting social inclusion working group  on disability presented a report to the First Minister and me at an event in Belfast City Hall. When we accepted that working  group&rsquo;s report, we committed to taking it to Executive colleagues to seek their  response. The report has already been agreed by Departments at official level.  The next step will be to discuss and agree a formal Executive response to the  report&rsquo;s recommendations. Following that, we will carry out a consultation  exercise on the response. The response to the report will form an important  part of the Government&rsquo;s implementation of the United Nations Convention on the  Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and it will promote equality of  opportunity for people with disabilities in line with our statutory and  equality duties.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We have already provided a copy of the report to the OFMDFM  Committee and have agreed that the Committee should be provided the opportunity  to comment on the Executive&rsquo;s response in due course.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hilditch</strong>:  I welcome the deputy First Minister&rsquo;s response. Can he assure the House that  every effort is being made to end discrimination and the abuse that people with  disabilities sometimes face in day-to-day society? Departments have been almost  silent on disability discrimination compared with other forms of discrimination  on, for example, grounds of race or religion.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: The report&rsquo;s key vision is of a future in which people with disabilities  contribute to and benefit from cultural, social, political and economic life on  an equal basis with others. We in OFMDFM absolutely agree with that. It is  essential that any government, particularly any that we are part of, recognise  the need to ensure that everybody in society has the ability to achieve their  full potential. We are absolutely committed to taking that work forward through  to the Executive and on to consultation in the total belief that, on the other  side of the process, we will have devised an approach and a strategy that  recognise that people with disabilities must be treated with respect and have  the unequivocal support of all Departments under our tutelage.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  Does the deputy First Minister agree that the best protection that this region  could offer people with disabilities would be a strong and inclusive bill of  rights? Do he and his Office agree with the SDLP that the British Government&rsquo;s  proposal for a bill of rights, which is currently out to consultation, is defective  and falls far short of the ambitions of this region and of the Good Friday  Agreement?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: I will speak now on my own behalf and as a member of Sinn F&eacute;in,  rather than on behalf of the Office of the First Minister and deputy First  Minister. My party has registered its strong opposition to the approach that  the British Government have taken. I would be surprised if many other Assembly  parties did not share some of the concerns of Sinn F&eacute;in and the SDLP, and,  indeed, those of many other people who are involved in community and voluntary  work.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I welcome the deputy First Minister&rsquo;s answers. If he wants to take those  efforts a step further, there is nowhere better to promote inclusion of people  with disabilities than the Building itself. Last week, I attended a conference  to which people with disabilities were denied entrance through the front door  of the Building. Why should people with disabilities not be permitted to enter  through the front door of Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s Parliament Buildings? They were  sidelined to a side door. I ask the Minister to take that on board.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. I must point out to the Member that his question is for the Assembly  Commission, not for the deputy First Minister. We shall move on to Question 5.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Mr McCarthy, it is clear that your supplementary question related to the  Assembly Commission&rsquo;s responsibilities in and around the Building.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We will move on. Question 5 has been withdrawn.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">Equality Commission</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">6. <strong>Mr  Campbell </strong>asked the First Minister and deputy First Minister, following the  publication of the latest fair employment monitoring report by the Equality  Commission, if they intend to hold discussions with the Equality Commission  regarding the under-representation of Protestants in organisations which come  under their remit, including the Equality Commission itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 668/10<a name="AQO668/10" id="AQO668/10"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: All specified public bodies, including the Department and its  agencies, are legally required by the Fair Employment and Treatment Order 1998  to monitor the community background of their workforces. The Order also places  a duty on them to conduct a review, at least once every three years, of their  employment composition and employment practices. The purpose of the review is  to determine whether both communities enjoy fair participation in employment.  Where that does not appear to be the case, employers may take affirmative  action measures to attract members of the under-represented community into  their employment.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Equality Commission has in place an affirmative action  programme designed to redress the imbalance of representation in its staff.  That includes the use of a statement in all job advertisements welcoming  members of the Protestant community; contacts with schools and third-level  educational establishments; contact with, and forwarding job vacancy  information to, community organisations servicing the Protestant community; and  engagement with representatives and people with influence in the Protestant  community. Officials maintain regular contact with the commission to keep the  situation under review.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  I note that there was an admission that some work goes on in bodies in which  there is an under-representation of one community or another, but there was no  admission that the Equality Commission is one of those bodies. Yet, the facts  are there; they are undeniable. The figures involved are quite small, but other  figures regarding recruitment of Protestants to many major public sector bodies  are equally undeniable; many thousands of them are denied equality of  opportunity. When is the deputy First Minister going to waken up to that  reality and address his mind to trying to resolve it?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: I remind the Member that when he asks a question of me, he is  asking a question of the Office of the First Minister and deputy First  Minister. I also remind him that, in my earlier answer, I said that the  Equality Commission has in place an affirmative action programme that is  designed to redress the imbalance of representation in its staff. I must point  out that when I was 15 years of age, I was a victim of religious  discrimination, so I know all about it, and under no circumstances would I  tolerate any section of our community being discriminated against because of  religion.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. Does the Minister accept that it is important that the  employ&shy;ment profile in the North reflects equality of opportunity, and that  equality means equality for everyone in this society, not for one community  over another?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: I absolutely agree that it is vital for the employment profile in  the North to fully reflect equality of opportunity, particularly in the public  sector. Some good progress has been made to ensure a more fully representative  employment profile across the public and private sectors. That has been due not  least to the pressure for more effective fair employment legislation and  implementation. However, there is still some way to go, and there remain  worrying levels of structural inequality across wider society.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  I listened very carefully to what the deputy First Minister was saying about  recruitment. Does he believe that the time has now come to take indicative action,  along the lines of the 50:50 recruitment policy for the PSNI, to redress some  of the long-standing under-representations of the Protestant community in  sections of the public sector?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: The difficulty is that, if we went right across the North, we  would be able to pick out all sorts of examples of people being  under-represented, whether in the Protestant community in regard to some  situations, or in the Catholic community in regard to others. I want to get  away from talking about the issue in the context of Protestant or Catholic. We  must recognise that all citizens have rights, and we have to ensure that, as we  move forward, there is equality of opportunity for everybody.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We are dealing with a one-off situation in respect of the  PSNI. Throughout the decades, since the partition of Ireland, there has been  under-representation in the police for many reasons. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: I will not turn this into a political debate, because I could  stand and talk about the subject for the next two hours without any difficulty.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">North/South Parliamentary Forum</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">7. <strong>Mr  Gallagher </strong>asked the First Minister and deputy First Minister for their  assessment of the proposed creation of a North/South parliamentary forum to  advance political understanding and wider opportunities on the island of Ireland.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  669/10<a name="AQO669/10" id="AQO669/10"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: Agreement to establish a North/South parliamentary forum is a  matter for the Assembly and the Oireachtas. The issue has been discussed at  North/South Ministerial Council plenary meetings. It was most recently  discussed at the meeting held in Limavady on 14 December 2009. At that meeting,  the Council noted that the establishment of a forum is a matter for the  Oireachtas and the Assembly under paragraph 21 of annex A to the St Andrews  Agreement. It also noted the Speaker of the Assembly&rsquo;s proposal to hold a  North/South parliamentary conference.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Two working groups, one in the Oireachtas and one in the  Assembly, have been established to develop proposals for a North/South  parliamentary forum. The Houses of the Oireachtas Commission and the Assembly  Commission held a joint meeting on 18 November to discuss issues of mutual  interest. During discussions, our Speaker, Mr William Hay, proposed that a  North/South parliamentary conference be arranged. That proposal was welcomed by  the Ceann Comhairle, and it was agreed to progress the matter through two working  groups established by both institutions. I understand that a meeting to discuss  arrangements for a North/South parliamentary conference, involving officials  from the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Assembly, was scheduled for last  week.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  Will the Minister provide more precise information on when the North/South  parliamentary forum will be established? I welcome the progress that he has  outlined. However, since the inter-parliamentary forum will be such an  important body for building trust among our politicians across Ireland and  improving understanding on the island, will OFMDFM soon be able to tell us that  it is going ahead with it?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: As I outlined in my answer, whether it goes ahead is a matter for  the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission and the Assembly Commission. As many  people know, we went through arduous negotiations in the Hillsborough  discussions, which lasted variously from 10 days to two weeks. The matter was  discussed, and the outcome is apparent in the document that was issued. It is  clear that the working group that we have established will have a  responsibility to take forward matters in the St Andrews Agreement that have  yet to be implemented. The responsibility rests with that group, and I hope that  its work will be expedited in the interests of ensuring that we see the full  implementation of what was agreed at St Andrews  some three years ago.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Chean Comhairle. T&aacute; ceist agam don Aire. Will the deputy  First Minister confirm that the parliamentary forum and all other outstanding  aspects of the St Andrews Agreement, including a strategy to promote and  enhance the Irish language, will be addressed and implemented through the  structures that were agreed at Hillsborough last Friday?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: As was made clear in the agreement that was published on Friday,  the First Minister and I will oversee an exercise that examines the St Andrews  Agreement and identifies all matters contained in it that have not been faithfully  implemented or actioned. We will provide a report to the Executive by the end  of February in which we will detail the level of progress that has been made on  each outstanding matter. We will seek approval from the Executive to set up a  working group to make recommendations on how progress can be made on matters  that have not been actioned. Junior Ministers will be asked to chair that  working group and to make an initial report by the end of March. Within four  weeks of the working group&rsquo;s initial report, we will agree a programme to  effect completion of the working group&rsquo;s agreed conclusions.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">OFMDFM: Legislative Programme</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">8. <strong>Mr  Kinahan </strong>asked the First Minister and deputy First Minister to detail their  Department&rsquo;s legislative programme for the current session of the Assembly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 670/10<a name="AQO670/10" id="AQO670/10"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: The Member will be aware that, in this session of the Assembly,  we introduced a Department of Justice Bill, which passed its Final Stage on 1  December last year. We are developing proposals for a commissioner for older  people and a victims and survivors&rsquo; service, and consultation exercises on the  respective proposals took place recently. Legislation will be required to  establish both of those, and once we have considered the consultation responses  and consulted with the Committee for the Office of the First Minister and  deputy First Minister, we intend to seek the agreement of the Executive to  finalise policy proposals ahead of introducing the relevant Bills in the  Assembly later this year. Furthermore, the Member will be aware from the  agreement that was published last Friday that we intend to introduce a Bill on  parades later this year. Other legislative requirements may arise in the  future, and the Executive&rsquo;s agreement to the policy and to the legislation will  be sought in accordance with the established procedures.</p>

      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="7"></a>Health, Social Services and Public Safety</p>
      <p class="H4StageHeading">Heart Disease</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mr I  McCrea </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety what  action he is taking to reduce the level of heart disease. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 711/10<a name="AQO711/10" id="AQO711/10"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: In June 2009, I  launched a service framework for cardiovascular health and well-being that set  standards for the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, rehabilitation and  palliative care of individuals in communities at a greater risk of developing  cardiovascular disease. In that context, action is being taken across a wide  range of areas to reduce heart disease, including initiatives to promote  healthier lifestyles and to reduce smoking, obesity and alcohol consumption.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In recognition of the pivotal role of GP practices,  substantial funding is provided to practices for the provision of lifestyle  advice on smoking cessation, safe alcohol consumption, healthy diet and  physical activity. In addition, GP practices maintain registers of at-risk  patients and carry out annual blood pressure assessments and medication reviews  for that group. My Department is also developing plans to make Northern Ireland  self-sufficient in cardiac surgery and is investing in cardiac rehabilitation.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister may be aware that Cookstown in my constituency  has the highest rate of heart disease in Northern Ireland for people under  65 years of age and the third highest for those under 75 years of age. Does the  Minister agree that those figures are startling and that the fact that it is a  rural constituency is cause for concern? Will he give details of what steps can  be taken in rural areas, especially areas that no longer have acute hospital  provision?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The first step taken is that I  established the Public Health Agency, and its key role is to take forward those  vital messages to the general public. The reality is that our hospitals are  filled with large numbers of people who, had they made different lifestyle  choices in years gone by, would not now be in hospital. Those lifestyle choices  relate to smoking, obesity, alcohol, and healthier lifestyles. Secondly, we are  dealing with the current situation. For example, we have a requirement for  1,000 cardiac procedures per annum, which is the capacity in the Royal Victoria   Hospital. However, demand  is higher than that, and we want to satisfy that demand and ensure that  patients do not come to harm by waiting overlong for their treatment.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am not aware of the specific numbers as regards  Cookstown. People in Cookstown are the same as everyone else in Northern Ireland:  they are entitled to the support of the Health Service for cardiac and any  other procedures, which are provided on the basis of equality and fair  treatment for all patients.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comprehensive  response, and I also welcome the additional investment in cardiac  rehabilitation. Does the Minister believe that the service framework dealing  with cardiac rehabilitation is working, and will he give the percentage of  heart attack patients who are able to access cardiac rehabilitation programmes?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: With regard to whether the  programme is working, the Health Service is, in general, clearly working and  that is evidenced by the higher life expectancy of the general population. For  example, 25 years ago, cardiac open heart surgery was, typically, provided for  patients in their fifties. Today, it is much more likely to be provided for  patients in their eighties, due to new medical interventions, the skills of our  cardiac teams and the work being undertaken by primary care through GP  practices. All that has combined to ensure that we are able to defer major  cardiac surgery until much later in life, which demonstrates that the system is  working.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The service framework for cardiovascular health and  well-being are new standards that the Department has put in place, which allow  patients to be shown exactly what type of service they should expect to receive.  The Department is rolling out similar frameworks across several other areas of  healthcare, and it has already done that for cancer and stroke services. Those  frameworks are all about improving the service and expanding quality of life.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  Will the Minister join me in paying tribute to the staff who work in cardiology  services across Northern    Ireland? Does he agree with me that,  contrary to what has been proposed by the DUP, health funding should not be  reduced? That will ensure that Northern    Ireland maintains the highest standards of  cardiac care.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Of course I agree with the  Member&rsquo;s second point about funding. Members have heard me make that point over  and over again, and I assure them that I will not get tired of making it. There  is substantial underfunding in health and social services in Northern Ireland,  as we heard during the previous debate on the McElhill/McGovern tragedy.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We have very highly talented and trained professional  cardiac teams in Northern    Ireland, which are headed by our cardiac  surgeons. Each of those surgeons requires a specialist team, including  cardiology anaesthetists and specialist nursing and theatre staff, who must be  trained and be able to maintain their skills. It is very much a team game, and  it is appropriate that we occasionally pay tribute to them, because they save  lives daily.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his very detailed response to the original question.  Will the Minister provide the cost of sending patients to places such as England and the  Republic for heart treatment?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Northern Ireland has the capacity  to conduct approximately 1,000 cardiac operations each year, and approximately  1,250 operations are required. Two years ago, I was presented with the choice  of allowing patients to remain on waiting lists until those operations became  available or sending them elsewhere. Our cardiac surgeons are very successful  in determining risk and ensuring that those who are most at risk come first,  but some patients were coming to harm while waiting for operations. Therefore,  I invested extra money in procedures to ensure that those patients received  timely interventions.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As I have said, those interventions are not all available  in Northern Ireland.  Therefore, the Department offered patients a choice among London,  Dublin and Glasgow.  The procedure in London is comparable to the  cost of a procedure in the Royal, but it is more expensive in Dublin. There are differences in travel and  accommodation costs. I am considering that matter, because the cost of travel  and accommodation brings the cost of having those interventions carried out in  Guy&rsquo;s Hospital to almost the same total as the Dublin clinics.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">However, one must give patients a choice, and patients very  often prefer Dublin  because it is a land rather than a sea trip. The other reality is that many of  those who require open-heart surgery today are much older and perhaps frailer  than they would have been 25 years ago. Indeed, many of those patients are very  often well into their 70s or 80s. All those factors must be taken into account  to ensure that our patients do not come to harm.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">DHSSPS: Budget 2010-11/Efficiency Savings</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr  McClarty </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  for an update on his Department&rsquo;s proposed revised budget for 2010-11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 712/10<a name="AQO712/10" id="AQO712/10"></a>)</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mr  O&rsquo;Dowd </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety if  he can provide an assurance that the additional savings to be found, as  announced by the Minister of Finance and Personnel, will not impact on front  line services.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 715/10<a name="AQO715/10" id="AQO715/10"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: With your permission, Mr  Speaker, I will answer question 2 and 5 together.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The position that I face in the next financial year is  dire. Not only am I faced with delivering &pound;700 million of existing efficiencies  and a 9% increase in demand, but I am facing a proposed budget reduction.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If implemented, the reduction would take my settlement to a  meagre 0&middot;3% above general inflation: in effect, it would be a stand-still  budget. My position is even worse than that. Given the increase in GP  referrals, the rapid ageing of the population and the increase in the birth  rate, I will have to find another &pound;100 million, or perhaps more, in order to  simply stand still. The Executive are well aware of those pressures but chose  to ignore them when making the proposal for a reduction. I cannot guarantee  that the additional cuts will not hit the front line.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McClarty</strong>:  I thank the Minister for that response. The facts and figures that he has  provided are not good news at all. The Minister will be aware that the revised  Budget Bill will be introduced to the House next week. Does he agree that any  party that votes to further cut the health budget by &pound;133 million will be  treated with contempt by the public? Does he also agree that if one does not  want cuts to the Health Service, one should not vote DUP? <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: It is possible that there will  be a lot of contempt floating around before all of us are much older. I have  outlined the situation in relation to the Health Service, and I make no apology  for doing so again. We need to find &pound;700 million to take out of the health  budget over three years. That is an enormous task, and it is causing huge  pressures in all the trusts. All Members need to bear that in mind when considering  the difficulties in the trusts in their areas.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is also estimated that, by the end of the CSR period, we  will be &pound;600 million short of the cost of providing a service comparable to  that provided in the UK.  As a unionist, I make no apology for saying that I believe that all parts of  the UK  should get equal treatment. However, that is not possible given the current  funding available to the Health Service.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Under the Budget settlement, I got full flexibility over my  resource and I was entitled to bid for funding to deal with pandemic flu.  However, when I bid for that, I had to accept a very poor settlement indeed,  which represents a very serious cut to the Health Service of well over &pound;30  million. As part of the Budget, I also made an agreement to receive the first  &pound;20 million of available in-year moneys; I am still waiting for that. All those  things add up, but the key thing that people must remember is that demand is up  by 9% this year, and was up by 12% last year. Those are huge increases, and  they cannot be addressed by a budget increase, in real terms, of less than 1%.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. It is clear that the Minister faces  difficult decisions, as do many of his ministerial colleagues. He made an  interesting comment when he said that, as a unionist, he expects everybody in  the UK  to receive the same treatment. Is that not part of the difficulty? The Minister  is looking at Health Service planning on the island of Ireland  from a unionist perspective, rather than a health perspective. Does he agree  that, as long as he is involved in turning his back on the Health Service in  the Twenty-six Counties and does not plan island-wide, we will continue to run  into the serious financial difficulties that we are currently faced with?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Over and over again, I have said  that where we can derive benefits for patients in Northern   Ireland, I am not averse to a co-operative venture with the  Irish Republic. Mary Harney takes a similar  approach.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I remind Mr O&rsquo;Dowd that cradle-to-grave healthcare is  provided universally and free at the point of delivery in the UK. That is not  the case in the Irish   Republic, where people  have to pay. The UK  has the only proper health service that actually delivers and is free at the  point of delivery. The UK&rsquo;s  Health Service is also the cheapest. In France  and Germany, there is a  hybrid of the system in the Republic   of Ireland. In America, where  there is a big debate on health, there is a purely private health service, and  people pay for that at the point of delivery. There, the health service costs 18%  of GDP. In France and Germany, the health service costs 10&middot;5% to 12% of GDP,  and in the UK, where the service is universally delivered, it is free and is  the best health service in the world, costing just over 8% of GDP. Not only is  it better and more efficient but it is cheaper.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  I understand the Minister&rsquo;s difficulty, and that of each Minister, in operating  under tight financial constraints. Will he join me in commending the many  groups that are involved in a voluntary capacity and which do excellent work,  particularly those that are involved in the area of chronic obstructive  pulmonary disease (COPD)? Within those tight constraints, will he consider what  assistance might be offered to try to help them to alleviate the difficulties  that people face?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I subscribe to Mr Campbell&rsquo;s  sentiments, and I will look to support anyone who provides health and care in  the Province, particularly those who alleviate and address the pain and  distress that so many patients feel. However, activity is directly  proportionate to the resources that are available to fund it, and as the  funding reduces in real terms, which is happening, activity is bound to reduce.  Therefore, tough choices are to be made, but I assure the House that I will not  make those choices on my own. I will allow every Member to join me in making  those tough choices about what happens in hospitals and with staff. As I have  done before, I assure every Member that the order of the reductions is severe.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  Does the Minister consider that the system of merit payments for consultants  and doctors represents an effective use of public funds? Does he intend to  return to that issue when he next undertakes pay negotiations?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I operate the system to the  optimum efficiency that I can derive. I take the opportunities to make savings,  and I will go forward on that basis. Merit payments, or payments by results,  are cost-effective in many areas. I can write to the Member to discuss the  basis of BMA contracts, and I remind him that, in Northern Ireland, consultants  in hospitals get paid less than they would get paid if they lived in the Irish  Republic or on the mainland and they get paid about a quarter of what they  would get paid if they lived in the United States.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Our entire Health Service provides value for money. I do  not pretend that it is perfect in every way and that there is no waste, but  where I see waste, I will seek to drive it out. As I said to Mr O&rsquo;Dowd, as a  general rule, the Health Service is efficient and we should be proud of it, not  simply because of the standard of care but because of the way that staff  provide that care with the limited budget that is offered to them.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  have sympathy for the position in which the Minister finds himself, but does he  regret describing his budget settlement as a &ldquo;good deal&rdquo; in February 2008? I  identify with the Minister&rsquo;s desire for common standards across the UK. Does he  agree that it is time for his party and his Executive colleagues to bite the  bullet over water charges? It is difficult to argue that the Health Service is  underfunded while taking a different approach to funding water to the rest of  the UK.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I am grateful that Mr Farry&rsquo;s  question went into the realms of water. I remind him that I am the Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety, not the Minister for water. I never  described the health budget as a good deal. I said that it was not enough but  was as good as it gets. The key UK  standard is democracy, and that standard governs us all. How would the  appointment of the Member&rsquo;s party leader as Minister for policing and justice  reinforce that principle in any way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Questions 3 and 4 have been withdrawn and question 5 was grouped with question  2.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">Hip Arthroscopy Surgery</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">6. <strong>Mr  McCarthy </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety to  provide an update on the provision of hip arthroscopy surgery.&nbsp; (AQO 716/10<a name="AQO716/10" id="AQO716/10"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The Health and Social Care Board  is working with trusts to develop an evidence-based business case for the  development of a hip arthroscopy service in Northern Ireland. In the interim,  where the procedure is recommended on clinical grounds, the Health and Social  Care Board will consider funding the treatment of individual patients through  the standard procedures for extra-contractual referral. The alternative  treatment is physiotherapy and medical therapy, and that may be offered to  patients if it is considered to be clinically appropriate.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I am deeply disappointed at that response, because it is exactly the same as a  written response that I got from the Minister almost one year ago. What has the  Minister got to say to a 34-year-old constituent of mine and, indeed, others  who are desperately seeking that surgery but cannot get it? They cannot even  get that service across the water, because they are being denied extra  contractual referrals by the trust. Those people&rsquo;s options are confined to  gobbling up medicine and pills.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I advise the Member to come to his question.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  What does the Minister say to those people?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I am just wondering what I will  say to Mr McCarthy. Hip arthroscopy is a low-demand service with around 30  procedures per annum: that is the figure for 2009-2010. We cannot provide that  type of service when it is in such low demand, because it would not be cost  effective given all the other demands on the Health Service. Hip arthroscopy is  usually performed through keyhole surgery, and patients can be referred to  hospitals on the mainland for the procedure. Physiotherapy and medical therapy,  as well as the standard surgical procedures, are also available. Arthroscopy  surgery is mainly used in operations on knee and shoulder joints. I regret that  folks have to wait longer for that surgery than they perhaps anticipate that  they should have to wait, and I am happy to look at the issue of waiting times  and referrals. However, I really believe that the demand for hip arthroscopy in  Northern Ireland  would need to be higher than it currently is in order for us to put that  service in place.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  Good, effective work in hip and knee replacement surgery has been ongoing. Will  the Minister outline whether the number of fractures that people sustained in  unfortunate incidents and falls during the severe weather this winter has had a  detrimental effect on those already on the waiting list for surgery?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I am sure that the Member is  aware that the Health Service experiences those pressures every winter. They  were particularly severe this winter, and we are still not out of that  situation. If the clinics at the Ulster Hospital, Craigavon Area Hospital, the  Royal Victoria Hospital and Altnagelvin Area Hospital cannot cope, we will &mdash;  this has happened on occasions &mdash; suspend elective surgery, which is planned  visits to hospital for planned surgery. Elective surgery was temporarily  interrupted, but I understand that extra sessions were put on at Altnagelvin  and other hospitals to deal with the increasing number of patients on the  waiting lists. I will keep that under review. It happens every year; it has  been slightly more severe this year. However, I think that the Health Service  has coped very well given the pressures under which it operates.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">Tyrone   County Hospital</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">7. <strong>Mr  Buchanan </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety if  he can confirm that the rehabilitation and palliative care beds at the Tyrone  County Hospital, as set out in the new model of care services, will be  sufficiently funded in order to ensure high-quality and safe services.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 717/10<a name="AQO717/10" id="AQO717/10"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Funding for individual services  in the Western Health and Social Care Trust area is a matter for the Western  Trust and the Health and Social Care Board to resolve. I understand that the  board has asked the trust to submit a business case for the recurrent funding  of palliative care beds at Tyrone   County Hospital  and that work on the business case is under way. Ensuring the safety of  patients receiving treatment in any part of the Health Service and the quality  of the services that they receive are my top priorities. I believe that the new  model of care services envisaged for the people of the Western Trust area is  consistent with those principles.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his response. The Minister will be aware that those  beds are part of the model of care services that was set up at the time when he  removed acute services from Tyrone   County Hospital.  I am sure that the Minister will also be aware that the commissioner of  services has informed the Western Trust that the board is not in a position to  fund those beds. How, therefore, can the Minister be committed to something  that the commissioner for services has indicated to the trust that the board is  not prepared to fund?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I do not know where Mr Buchanan  got that information from. It is about as consistent as the other information  that he frequently offers to me on the Floor of the House, not least his  intervention during this morning&rsquo;s debate on the Omagh fire when he pointed the  finger firmly and straight at social services workers. Shame on him for that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The trust has been asked to submit a business case for  rehabilitation and palliative care beds. Business cases are submitted to show  that a need exists and to demonstrate value for money. That is happening now,  and it will subsequently be determined what degree of service will be provided.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Buchanan, for one, majored on efficiencies. My  Department is investigating how to provide palliative and rehabilitation care  beds in the Tyrone   County and achieve the  optimum value for money.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>: <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Even when shouting from a  sedentary position, Mr Buchanan should make his remarks a little more  consistent with what he said in the past.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  Does the Minister agree with everyone in the Omagh and Enniskillen areas that  the best way to secure safe services in the long term is through the provision  of new hospitals? The hospital on the Enniskillen site is going ahead. Will the  Minister assure Members that the plans and funding for the new hospital in  Omagh, which were to follow on smoothly from those for the Enniskillen  hospital, are in place?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: When the Member began his  question, I wondered what on earth he was going to say next. The hospital in  Enniskillen is on time and on the money, and it will be delivered by the  expected date.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In the teeth of opposition from Mr Buchanan and others, I  announced plans for a new enhanced local hospital at Omagh. That is still in  the planning process, and funding is at least a year away. We all know what is  happening to funding at the moment. Perhaps Mr Buchannan would talk to his  colleague the Minister of Finance and Personnel and come back to the House in  due course to tell us how much funding will be made available for the hospital  in Omagh &mdash; but no one will hold their breath for that to happen.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  Does the Minister share my concern at Mr Buchanan&rsquo;s continually negative  remarks on the entire health provision in the south-west of the Province? Will  the Minister confirm that the commitment of providers in the south-west to the  Health Service is absolute and that the acute services hospital in Enniskillen  will be delivered on time?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I confirm that the hospital will  be delivered on time and will provide the full range of services that one would  expect of an acute hospital. It will be a major addition to the provision of  hospital services in the south-west. Those services will include 24/7 A&amp;E,  inpatient medicine and surgery, paediatrics, obstetrics and gynaecology, a  critical care unit and day procedures. Its comprehensive range of outpatient  services will include medicine, surgery, paediatrics, and obstetrics and  gynaecology. It truly is the twenty-first century hospital that the south-west  so badly needs.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">All that is needed now is a decent road from Enniskillen to  Omagh. If I could provide that at no expense to the Health Service, I would do  so, but I notice that the Minister who is responsible for roads is about to  step up to take questions.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">Disability Strategy</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">8. <strong>Ms  Anderson </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  when the disability strategy will be published.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  718/10<a name="AQO718/10" id="AQO718/10"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: My officials are working to  develop and publish a draft disability strategy for full public consultation by  the end of March 2010. Recently, significant progress has been made towards  achieving that goal; for example, a multiagency project team has been  established to oversee and contribute to the development of the strategy, and  pre-consultation events have been held to engage with health and social care  professionals, service users, carers and the voluntary and community sector. It  is anticipated that the finalised strategy will be published by early autumn.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  The disability strategy is cross-cutting and cross-departmental in nature.  Therefore, is the Health Department working with OFMDFM on the consultation on  promoting social inclusion, which the deputy First Minister mentioned today,  and on the working group report that was handed over to OFMDFM in December  2009?</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The Member makes an important  point about social inclusion. The Health Service provides most of its care for  those in the first and last 10 years of their life, by definition the most  vulnerable individuals in our society. Any cuts to the health budget will  specifically hit those people, so there is no way around an equality impact  assessment, except by sleight of hand.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We are looking to develop our strategy with any Department  that has a cross-cutting interest. We have developed a number of strategies.  The issue is getting the strategy right and getting the plans and the resource  in place to back it up. That is what I am looking to do in a disability  strategy.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is a fact that disability increases with age, and it is  also a fact that women are more likely to have a disability than men, unless  they are in their younger adult years. Disability gets worse with age, so a  strategy is a key measure in extending life and ensuring quality of life.</p>
      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="8"></a>Regional Development</p>
      <p class="H4StageHeading">Belfast  Rapid Transit System</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mr  McClarty </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development for an update on the  progress of the rapid transit system.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  725/10<a name="AQO725/10" id="AQO725/10"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development (Mr Murphy)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.  My Department is undertaking a public consultation exercise on the policy  proposals to inform a new rapid transit Bill. The consultation period will run  until 19 February 2010. After that, the Department will consider the views  expressed by the consultees and produce a consultation report that will contain  the finalised policy.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The rapid transit division is preparing an outline business  case for the project. The outline business case process will identify the  preferred options for rapid transit with regard to the network routes, a  procurement strategy, a commercial business model and a fare system.  Identifying the preferred options will allow the Department to undertake the  necessary public consultation, impact assessments and appraisals on the various  options before recommending a final route alignment for each of the three  routes.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McClarty</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his response. Will the Minister give the House  assurances that the scheme will be developed in a way that will allow for an  upgrade to light rail and an extension to the Belfast commuter belt in the future? Does he  accept that Belfast&rsquo;s  transport requirements will only grow and grow in the future and that he needs  to make future development as easy as possible?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I accept that the transport requirements in Belfast will continue to  grow, which is why we have sought to bring forward proposals to address that,  such as rapid transit. High dependence on the car, even in the Belfast area, is causing a serious problem  for our road network. Therefore, proposals such as rapid transit and more  quality bus corridors in and around the Belfast  area will be vital in the years ahead.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Future-proofing of anything that is done now is essential.  That is why I wanted to ensure that the Environment Minister, the Social  Development Minister and I were together on the Belfast  city centre proposals so that no Department was doing anything that would  inhibit the development of a better transport system in and around the city centre  and Belfast  generally.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The rapid transit system is designed so that it could be  upgraded to light rail, if numbers justified such a move. Although the initial  proposal is for three pilot routes, the hope and intention is that the system  will include further routes. In due course, that may well take into  consideration some of the areas that the Member talked about.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  I bear in mind the points that the Minister made about statutory consultation  on aspects of the rapid transit system. Is his Department having discussions  with the Planning Service on some aspects of the rapid transit system, and will  he update us on any meetings that have taken place?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The current consultation, which closes on 19  February, is on the legislative proposals, which are, in essence, enabling  legislation. The consultation is not about the detail of the projects or the  routes; that discussion is being taken forward by the rapid transit group in  the Department. That group is in discussions with all stakeholders, and I am  sure that that includes planners.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The group is examining each of the three routes that were  proposed as pilot schemes and talking to various people on the ground such as  business organisations, public transport providers, planners and Belfast City  Council. There will be a consultation period when it releases its proposals for  those three routes.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Question 2 has been withdrawn.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">Car Parking</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Mr F  McCann </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development how Roads Service  intends to manage the issue of commuter parking in residential areas,  especially in Belfast.&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 727/10<a name="AQO727/10" id="AQO727/10"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: By way of background, I should explain that the Belfast metro&shy;politan  area plan 2015 sets out the transport proposals that my Department aims to have  implemented by 2015. The plan has identified some areas of parking restraint  where it is my Department and Roads Service&rsquo;s intention to work towards the  improved management of parking, including, where appropriate, the introduction  of residents&rsquo; parking schemes.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Members will be aware that Roads Service&rsquo;s initial attempts  to introduce the first residents&rsquo; parking schemes in the inner-city areas of Belfast were met with  considerable local opposition, particularly on the cost of a permit. That led  to a considerable delay while my officials dealt with those concerns. Despite  the fact that we amended the policy on the introduction of residents&rsquo; parking  schemes to address local residents&rsquo; concerns, I regret that the most recent  consultation in Belfast still failed to gain sufficient support to allow a  scheme to be implemented. However, I am aware of the difficulties that  residents experience in many areas of Belfast,  and I have not closed down any options that are open to me to resolve the  issue. I will meet my officials to consider the best approach for moving  forward in light of the experience that has been gained to date and in a way  that will harness residents&rsquo; support.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. Is the Minister open to exploring the introduction of  separate schemes in the five identified areas of Belfast, as opposed to operating them  together as is currently proposed?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: As I said in my initial answer, I am not closing down  any option. I was disappointed because the central objection and, in some  cases, the only objection was the cost of the permits. I moved to address that  problem and removed the cost of permits. However, when we surveyed in all five  areas, we found a very low level of response, which indicated some degree of  apathy in those areas towards the parking schemes and nowhere near the required  level of support. However, I will meet officials tomorrow to discuss how to  make progress, and I am happy to discuss any option to get the schemes off the  ground.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>:  Does the Minister accept that the problem exists because our public transport  system is simply inadequate? Does he accept that improving the reliability,  price and quality of public transport into the city centre would have a direct  effect on the problem of on-street parking?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I accept that. We have been striving to achieve that,  and passenger numbers on the rail and bus networks have grown considerably over  the past number of years. The impetus is to continue to invest to ensure that  public transport is reliable, comfortable and accessible. All of our  substantial investment in public transport has been intended to achieve that  outcome.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Of course, that is one aspect of what needs to happen to  stop the problem of people taking cars into city centre areas and parking them  there all day. We must reduce the availability of parking spaces in the city  centre. Ultimately, we must adopt a carrot-and-stick approach to get more and more  people out of private cars and on to public transport. However, public  transport needs to be brought up to scratch; the investment is trying to  achieve that.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s acknowledgement that the early trials of residents&rsquo;  parking schemes were a failure, particularly in south Belfast. Will the Minister give a commitment  to the House to work with me and colleagues in other constituencies that are  badly affected by commuter parking to develop schemes that satisfy the  community? Does he accept that many communities would welcome properly managed  and properly designed residential parking schemes?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I do not accept that the proposed parking schemes  have been a failure. The exercise was not met with the support that we wanted.  Nonetheless, while teasing out the issues and working with communities in  inner-city areas, we addressed a range of issues and examined each area to  determine its specific requirements. The residents&rsquo; parking scheme has been tailored  for each area. As the Member will know, each area is different and has  different requirements.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have met many elected representatives from all areas of Belfast to discuss those  schemes, and I am happy to continue to do so. I know that there is a demand in  other areas, and we are keen to get some schemes under way, if only to display  the benefits that can flow from a residents&rsquo; parking scheme. Where none exists,  it is hard to point out the benefits that will accrue to neighbourhoods. The  areas that suffered the most acute stress were the five inner-city areas that  have been identified; quite rightly, the schemes in those areas are a priority.  We have not given up on getting those schemes off the ground, and we will  continue to examine all options. I am happy to discuss those issues with any  elected representatives in any of those areas.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: When  I last spoke to the Minister, I mentioned Stranmillis. Will he confirm that,  when he attends his meeting tomorrow, he will consider areas just outside the  five identified areas in the first pilot scheme such as the lower Malone Road and  Stranmillis?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: My colleague mentioned the Bogside, which is also  being considered as part of the scheme.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The problem of all-day residents&rsquo; parking was most acute in  the inner-city areas closest to the city centre, and that is where the priority  was. Nonetheless, the Member is right: a range of other areas has been  identified, and some preliminary assessments have been done in those areas,  including the lower Malone Road  and Stranmillis and, indeed, the Bogside in Derry.  All those issues will be up for discussion as we try to move those schemes  forward.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">Railways</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mr Burns </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development to detail his priorities in  relation to the extension of the rail network.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  728/10<a name="AQO728/10" id="AQO728/10"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: My priority is to maintain, improve and upgrade  existing railway lines in the region. There are no plans to extend the rail  network at this time. The development of an overall railway infrastructure was  considered during the production of the business case that was completed in  August 2007 for the New Trains Two programme. That followed the work of an  interdepartmental group that was established in 2006 to consider options for  future investment in the railway network here.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As a result, it was agreed that we should continue the  emphasis on maintaining and improving the existing infrastructure and improving  passenger services. The planned investment in public transport by my Department  in the North of Ireland over the next 10 years is set out in the investment  delivery plan, which is published on the Strategic Investment Board&rsquo;s website.  Therefore, my current priority is to extend the track life of the line between  Ballymena and Coleraine; introduce 20 new trains with supporting platform  infrastructure and stabling facilities over the next few years; and undertake a  full relaying of the line between Coleraine and Derry.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Along with essential maintenance, total rail invest&shy;ment  over the next three years could be close to &pound;250 million. That demonstrates  clearly my commitment to rail investment. Future investments in the railway  will be considered in the context of the current regional development strategy  and regional transportation strategy review, the next comprehensive spending  review period and ISNI.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burns</strong>: As  the Minister knows, my aim is to get the railway line between Lisburn and  Antrim reopened to service Belfast   International Airport.  Has the Minister had any further discussions with the Kilbride Group regarding  the development of a station at the International   Airport, the feasibility  study for which he agreed to contribute to at a meeting last year?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I share the Member&rsquo;s view: I would like to see that  line reopened, and I would like to see the railway network extended. However, I  am dealing with the here and now, and I am securing a substantial investment to  ensure that what we have continues to operate properly and is improved,  including the number of trains on the network.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As the Member said, I met representatives of the Kilbride  Group&rsquo;s community rail group in March 2009. We discussed proposals to have the  Antrim to Knock&shy;more railway line reopened in order to provide new commuter  services. Given the proximity of Belfast   International Airport  to the line, the Kilbride Group&rsquo;s representatives argued for a feasibility  study to develop a halt or station at the airport. I made it clear that, if  they secured local council support for a study, my Department would contribute  to the cost. There has been no follow-up from the Kilbride Group since.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I encourage Members to stand in their place if they want to ask a supplementary  question.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>:  While we are on the subject of the development of the rail network, will the  Minister update the Assembly on the provision of new trains, particularly those  for use on the Larne line?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The Member will know that we signed off on the  procurement of 20 new trains last year. I do not have the exact details to  hand, but I recollect that they are to come into service in 2012 or 2013. The  Member and other East Antrim Members have raised the issue of trains on the  Larne line on many occasions. There is a commitment, when the new trains come  into service, to replace the trains on the Larne line. That will be done very  shortly after they come into service.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>:  The Minister is aware of the high cost of the railway line from Antrim to  Lisburn. However, has he other possible routes in mind so that we can have a  railway system that measures up to his expectations?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: It is not necessarily a question of what I have in  mind. There has been a strong lobby to extend the rail network, particularly in  the north-west. That applies not just to this Administration; there has been a  strong cross-border lobby to extend the railway service into Tyrone, Derry, Fermanagh and Donegal. There is an obvious gap in  the rail network in Ireland  in the north-west.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member is right that extending the rail network would  be expensive. Some say that it could be done at the drop of a hat or that Europe is willing to invest a huge amount of money, but  that does not always prove to be the case. Europe  has been very supportive but not to the extent of opening entire new railway  networks.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department will continue to press the case. I have  supported those who have come to me wanting to extend the railway network and  have encouraged them to continue to build their case and to lobby for it. Even  though the population in the west is more scattered, the importance of  sustainable transport will move higher up the agenda as congestion increasingly  becomes a problem.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  We should never have closed the line to Comber.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">Portaferry-Strangford Ferry</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mr  Hamilton </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development if any assessment has  been made of the need to provide an improved backup service for the Portaferry  to Strangford ferry.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 729/10<a name="AQO729/10" id="AQO729/10"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The Department&rsquo;s Roads Service reviewed the need for  a backup service for the Portaferry to Strangford ferry several years ago. In  2009, Roads Service produced the MV Rachlyn foot passenger-only vessel. The  vessel is now available in its backup role, should the MV Portaferry II and the  MV Strangford car and foot passenger service not be operational.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer. Does he agree that two breakdowns of the  40-year-old backup vessel, the MV Strangford, over a 24-hour period during the  critical Christmas period is unacceptable? Does he also accept that equally  problematic during those breakdowns was the perceived lack of information given  to passengers? That included the continually malfunctioning electronic signage,  which his Department purchased some years ago at more than &pound;200,000, on some of  the roads around the Ards   Peninsula.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I am disappointed and share the Member&rsquo;s frustration  that the service was not available over Christmas. MV Portaferry II, the main  operating vessel, was in dock for its annual refit from 5 November 2009.  Unfortunately, the main backup vessel, the MV Strangford, developed an engine  failure that proved difficult to diagnose. Consequently, that disrupted  services from 26 to 29 December. The MV Strangford had been operating reliably  before that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate the difficulties, as people from the peninsula  rely heavily on the service. I will raise the operation of the service with  Roads Service. Lessons will have to be learned from that breakdown, because no  one likes a breakdown in the service. Information is essential to those who use  the service. I will, therefore, raise the issue of signage with Roads Service  to ensure that we learn lessons.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  Will the Minister confirm that there is a foot passenger-only vessel anchored  somewhere in Strangford Lough that cannot be put into service because the crew  has not been trained? Is there a reason for that delay?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: Roads Service plans to recruit additional crew. Two  mechanical maintenance staff have been appointed, although they have yet to  take up the posts pending security clearance. Agency staff are being brought in  to assist on deck until permanent crew have been appointed.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answers. Has he discussed the Portaferry to  Strangford ferry with his counterpart in DETI with a view to encouraging  tourism? Despite a number of breakdowns, the service operates regularly, and it  could be a tourist attraction.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: No; however, I concur with the Member&rsquo;s view. Having  crossed on the ferry on a lovely sunny afternoon, I know that it is a beautiful  part of the world. The ferry service greatly enhances that, and it could become  a tourism feature. I will mention it to the Minister at the next opportunity.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Mr Campbell is not in his place to ask question 6, and question 7 has been  withdrawn.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">A1 Beech Hill to Cloghogue</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">8. <strong>Mr  Boylan </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development for an update on the A1  Beech Hill to Cloghogue road scheme.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  732/10<a name="AQO732/10" id="AQO732/10"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The A1 Beech Hill to Cloghogue dual carriageway is  being constructed as part of package 2 of the Roads Service design, build, finance  and operate (DBFO) programme. Amey Lagan Roads Limited is the project company,  and Lagan Ferrovial is the construction contractor. I can confirm that work is  progressing satisfactorily: for example, the bridge providing access from Derrybeg Lane to Newry&rsquo;s  new railway station has been open to traffic for several months.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Lagan Ferrovial also made a particular effort to make the  Cloghogue junction at the southern end of the scheme available to traffic at  the beginning of December to assist with Christmas travel. At the northern end  of the scheme, traffic has been moved onto the new northbound dual carriageway  between Beech Hill and the new Sheepbridge junction to facilitate the completion  of the southbound carriageway at that location.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Lagan Ferrovial recently indicated that construction works  on this strategic road improvement scheme were ahead of schedule. Therefore,  subject to that momentum being maintained, there is an expectation that the new  road may be open to traffic ahead of the programme completion date of December  2010.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his answer. I  hope that he keeps Armagh in mind if he  intends to introduce a new railway network. If there is an opportunity for  sections of the new road to be completed on time, will they be opened ahead of  the completed road scheme?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: Lagan Ferrovial indicates that it does not plan to  open the A1 Beech Hill to Cloghogue dual carriageway in sections. It points out  that substantial completion of the construction works under the DBFO contract  requires road safety audits, snagging works and other commissioning activities  to be carried out that will require access to the new dual carriageway. It also  advised that, as construction works progress, it will be necessary to transfer  traffic onto sections of the new dual carriageway from time to time. Those  arrangements will involve temporary traffic measures.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Does the Minister agree that the  completion of the new A1, welcome as it will be, will have only minimal impact  on the traffic chaos in Newry, especially the tailbacks on the Camlough, Belfast and Warrenpoint  Roads? Will he outline how he intends to address that problem in the interim as  we await the progress of the southern relief road for Newry?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I do not agree with the Member. He knows the area as  well as I do, and, when the strategic traffic &mdash; the Belfast to Dublin traffic &mdash;  is separated from traffic going into Newry on the Belfast Road, that will have  a substantial impact on the Camlough Road when the new junction is available.  It will also have an impact on the backup of traffic there.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member mentioned the Warrenpoint Road, and the southern relief  road is a project that we are pressing forward with. Interim measures have been  taken, such as signalling and park-and-ride facilities, to encourage more  people to use public transport. However, Newry&rsquo;s problems are experienced in every  urban area across the island and beyond. A substantial increase in the use of  private cars has created difficulties for road systems that were not built to  cope with such a volume.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I assure the Member that, when finished, the road will have  a significant impact. He said &ldquo;welcome as it will be&rdquo;, and I am sure that he  will be out welcoming it when it does open. I am sure that he will also welcome  the substantial investment that we have made in Newry railway station, which  will encourage more of the travelling public to use public transport.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Mr Lunn is not in his place to ask question 9.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">Coleraine   Harbour</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">10. <strong>Mr  Dallat </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development to outline his plans for  Coleraine harbour.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 734/10<a name="AQO734/10" id="AQO734/10"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: Coleraine harbour is a trust port, and my direct  responsibility is limited to matters relating to its governance structure. As  part of the forthcoming public consultation exercise on new harbours  legislation, I intend to consult on my view that, in principle, Coleraine  harbour should become a municipal port. Under that proposal, ownership would  transfer from Coleraine Harbour Commissioners to Coleraine Borough Council.  Such a change in status would be effected by means of a transfer order that would  be brought to the Assembly for approval.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>:  The Minister will be aware that there has been a wind of change in the  Coleraine Harbour Commissioners, largely because new people with vision have  been introduced there. Those people have produced a master plan in a short  time. Does the Minister agree that it is right to revisit the proposals, given  that Coleraine will need to be developed to handle the traffic that will flow  from the Shannon and the Erne when the Ulster canal is reopened?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The Member referred to &ldquo;new people with vision&rdquo;; I  will have to take his word that the old people did not have vision. From my  early discussions with people in that area, including the Coleraine Harbour  Commissioners, I concluded that it would be best to transfer the harbour to  Coleraine Borough Council and to make it a municipal port. However, that  proposal is out for consultation, and I am open to what that will bring. If  things have changed, I am sure that we will be able to adapt accordingly.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">A6 Road  Scheme</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">11. <strong>Mr  Leonard </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development for an update on the A6  road scheme.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 735/10<a name="AQO735/10" id="AQO735/10"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I assume that the Member is referring to the proposed  A6 Derry to Dungiven dual carriageway scheme, which will incorporate a dual  carriageway bypass of Dungiven. Roads Service has advised that work to finalise  a reference design for the scheme is continuing. That will enable the  completion of the environmental statement in preparation for the publication of  the draft direction and investment Orders. It is anticipated that those Orders  will be published before the end of 2010.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Consultations with statutory bodies on environmental issues  are under way. Two site investigation contracts, with a combined value of &pound;1  million, have just been awarded. I can further advise that a public exhibition  that was held in Strathfoyle on 19 and 20 January sought the views of local  residents and businesses on proposals for the A2 between the Maydown and Caw  roundabouts. Those proposals resulted from those that were made for the new  A2/A6 junction at Stradreagh.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Leonard</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. I thank the Minister for his answer. Will he confirm how  much the A6 Derry to Dungiven dualling scheme will cost?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: It is estimated that the scheme will cost between  &pound;320 million and &pound;390 million.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">Town Centres</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">12. <strong>Mr G  Robinson </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development what co-operation  exists between his Department and local councils to ensure that the commercial  centres of towns are accessible during periods of freezing weather.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 736/10<a name="AQO736/10" id="AQO736/10"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: This could be a record, a Cheann Comhairle.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I advise the Member that there is no statutory duty on  Roads Service or, indeed, on district councils, which are responsible for  street cleaning, to salt or to clear snow and ice from footways. A key outcome  of the most recent review of the winter services, policies and procedures that  Roads Service operates and that the Assembly debated fully and accepted, was  that the practice of targeting the limited resources available at the busier  main routes should continue.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The review also included the treatment of footways. At that  time, it was recognised that the cost of salting footways was prohibitive and  that the basic logistics of introducing what were largely manual tasks would be  impractical. It was proposed that, in periods of prolonged lying snow, the Department  should seek to enlist the help of other agencies, such as district councils, to  assist in clearing busy town centre footways. The then Minister wrote to each  council to outline the proposals for partnering arrangements for the removal of  snow and ice from town centre footways and pedestrian areas.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Roads Service followed that up by writing to each council  to explain the proposals in detail, and it enclosed a proposed model  arrangement. In consultation with NILGA (Northern Ireland Local Government  Association), Roads Service drew up a draft legal agreement. However, only a  small number of councils signed up to that agreement. Therefore, the resources  that are available to treat snow and ice on footways are somewhat limited. No  further action was taken at that time. However, following the recent prolonged  spell of wintry weather, I have asked the chief executive of Roads Service to  revisit the proposed partnering arrangements with councils.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  Will more salt boxes be provided, particularly in very remote rural areas?  During the recent period of extreme weather, a lot of people called at my  office to request an extension of that facility.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: During the prolonged spell of wintry weather, I had a  discussion with Roads Service, and its experience is that periods of extreme  weather provide an opportunity to test systems to see how they are working.  Salt piles and grit are provided on request. Generally, those requests are made  by people who live in difficult stretches of road. Indeed, elected  representatives make such requests.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There are some 3,500 salt boxes across the North, and there  are criteria for where they are located to ensure that they are adequately  spread out and that they are not too close together. It is a matter of having a  discussion with the depot manager or the Roads Service manager in one&rsquo;s area to  identify the areas where salt boxes are required. It is during the summer that  such measures will be taken. It is difficult for Roads Service vehicles to get  out in icy weather in order to provide new salt piles. If people could identify  the trouble spots from their winter experience and discuss them with local  managers, we could see whether those needs could be met during the summer so  that salt and grit could be in place for the following winter.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  Our weather patterns have changed dramatically and will, by all accounts,  continue to change. Does the Minister agree that instead of fiddling around and  trying to get councils to do one thing, someone else to do another and someone  else again to do a third, an official should go to a country such as Germany to see  how it deals with consistent snowfall, year on year? In that way, a  comprehensive policy to deal with the situation could be devised.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The problem is that weather patterns are not  consistent. On the one hand, we are told that there is global warming; on the  other, we have the coldest winter in 30 years. The fact that we have not  experienced such weather for 30 years illustrates that we do not get the  weather patterns that are usually experienced in the centre of a large  continent. There are always lessons to be learnt, but Ireland is an  island and it is affected by different climatic conditions. Ours is a difficult  country to plan for because it does not have a consistent weather pattern. All  we can do is try to improve the systems we have. We have developed systems that  cover the vast majority of the needs of the travelling public. However, that  still presents problems for people living in rural areas.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As for district councils, the gritting and salting of  footpaths is a largely manual operation: it is not suited to Roads Service  which works mostly from vehicles. There is an opportunity to use the connection  between regional government and local government. I discussed that with local  government in my own area, and I found that manual staff who could have been  available for work such as clearing footpaths had been laid off because they  could not work. I am disappointed that the discussion a number of years ago did  not bear fruit, but, in the light of this winter&rsquo;s experience, there is an  opportunity to revisit it.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. That ends Question Time. I know that a number of questions were withdrawn,  but we were able to answer eight questions. I receive complaints all the time  from Back-Benchers that Ministers take time deliberating in their answers.  However, we cannot say that today, and so I congratulate the Minister. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. I concur with all the remarks you make, as do  many Members from around the Chamber. I hope that the Minister&rsquo;s colleagues  will take a lesson from Minister Murphy&rsquo;s achievement in this respect.</p>
      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="9"></a>Private Members&rsquo; Business</p>
      <p class="H4StageHeading">Schools Estate</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Debate resumed on motion:</p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly notes the need for newbuild and ongoing  maintenance to ensure provision of a schools estate fit for the twenty-first  century; recognises the additional economic benefit of construction industry  job creation; and calls on the Minister of Education and the Minister of  Finance and Personnel to ensure that a procurement mechanism is in place, which  expedites the provision of capital projects, and that adequate funds are  provided to maintain our schools to the highest possible standards. &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Mr D Bradley]</span></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  The Minister for Regional Development is leaving the Chamber, and I am trying  to work out how we will be able to cope with his ego from now on.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have considered the motion carefully. On balance, it is  very worthy and it deserves to be supported. I hope that it is passed. All  parties should enthusiastically support the call to provide a schools estate  fit for the twenty-first century and should support the Minister as she bids  for additional resources and capital in the monitoring process. Parties should  recognise immediately the economic benefit that accrues to the construction industry  from newbuild and ongoing maintenance spend.</p>
      <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Molloy] in the Chair)</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">This matter relates to the Education Department, but when  our spending Departments put their minds towards ensuring that there is maximum  uptake from local industry and enterprises, that benefits indigenous companies.  I look forward to the publication of the Finance Committee&rsquo;s report on the  procurement process. Despite various entreaties from all parties in the House,  there is work still to be done to open up participation and opportunity for  indigenous companies to avail of government contracts.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education (Mr Storey)</strong>: Does the Member accept that  there is a huge difficulty with procurement, which is why the frameworks  collapsed? Indigenous companies are excluded from the procurement process  because of the introduction of a process that has created a wider net. The  result is that local companies involved in maintenance, minor works and capital  works are being severely penalised and are unable to get the work that will  supply local industries and local people doing those jobs.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  I accept the Member&rsquo;s point. The Finance Committee examined that matter. Quite  clearly, legal challenges have contested the orthodoxy that bigger is  necessarily better. We have seen the anomaly where local indigenous companies  carried out 100% of the works but did so under the project management of big  multinationals, which had all the in-house facilities to ensure that they won  the tendering process. There is scope, which is the point that I made. I value  the comments that the Member made in that respect.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The final section of the motion states that adequate funds  should be provided:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;to maintain our schools to the highest possible  standards.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is a very worthy statement. The proposer would  have done justice to his commendable motion had he indicated how much he was  talking about. That is a very high standard, and people would want to see &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way. I would certainly have indicated how much  money is needed had the Minister provided me, as a member of the Education  Committee, with that figure. Had the Member been here for the debate this  morning, he would have heard that the Minister has not provided the Committee  with that information. Perhaps, when she brings forth the information, I will  be in a better position to provide a figure.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member has an extra minute in which to speak.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  I welcome the point that was made. I was present for the debate this morning:  competing diary commitments created the initial difficulty. I paid particular  attention to the proposer&rsquo;s arguments, and I make it clear that I support him.  My point is that, over and over again, we have heard arguments from the same  party that do not specify where exactly the money would come from, what other  budgets would be affected, or how the Executive could address the grandiose  claims that are made.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The general thrust is that everyone would address the  stricture in the motion, which states that schools should be maintained to the  highest possible standards. We are discussing only one of the spending  Departments. There are a number of them, and they have all been affected. We  have heard the arguments being made for an increase in the budgets for social  housing and health. However, we have a finite amount of money that has been  reduced somewhat as a result of external economic conditions changing, the  responses of the British Government to those and the falling property prices,  which have rendered the entire programme of the disposal of surplus assets of  no benefit at all to those spending Departments in the present circumstances.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member should bring his remarks to a close.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  Bring forward the motions and arguments to achieve the highest possible  standards, but let us be sensible. It is time to get away from that  pie-in-the-sky argument.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I support the motion, because the issue must be considered. The Minister will  be under no illusion about the issues that I will highlight and draw to her  attention yet again. It is important that we do so within the remit of the  proposal. In particular, I will make very clear the issues that are vitally  important to the people whom I represent and to the constituency of Strangford.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion clearly outlines the fact that we must ensure  that the physical aspects of our schools maintain the highest standards of the  education system that we provide, and it asks for a mechanism to be put in  place.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister of Finance and Personnel has made clear his  Department&rsquo;s dedication to the construction industry and to playing its part in  ensuring that work that is carried out goes to home-grown talent and firms.  Indeed, government projects account for over 40% of construction work. That can  be maintained and built on, not just for the sake of ensuring that jobs are in  place but because that work must be done.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The October 2009 report, &lsquo;Construction in the UK Economy:  The Benefits of Investment&rsquo;, highlights the multiplier effect of construction  on the economy.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Tha repoart suggests that fer ivery &pound;1 pit in tae  coanstructshin, that thers aa&rsquo; hael benifut tae tha naetshin o&rsquo; &pound;2&middot;85 an fer  ivery &pound;1 pit in tae roads an infastructur, aa&rsquo; foar braider benifut o&rsquo; &pound;4&middot;83.  This is sumthin whuch Aa&rsquo; hae bin saein fer yeers an it is ther fer aw tae see  that tha benifuts er twaufoal: joabs in tha shoart term an lang term benifuts  tae tha economy.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The report advises that for every &pound;1 spent on construction,  the nation derives a wider economic benefit of &pound;2&middot;85. For every &pound;1 spent on  roads, infrastructure benefits by &pound;4&middot;83. I have been saying that for years. The  benefits are twofold: jobs in the short term and economic dividends in the long  term. The Minister of Finance and Personnel also recognises that, and he has  consequently ensured continued investment in that realm. He has set up a task  force to help to bring about the right results: getting people off unemployment  benefits and into jobs that enhance their skills.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, the Minister provided budgets for each  Department that, if properly managed, will ensure that capital is spent on  construction and maintenance. The Minister of Education must fulfil her role in  that area. She must take a real look at her Department, how it is organised and  how it uses its capital spend.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I cannot talk about newbuilds without mentioning one that  is close to my heart, and I declare an interest, Mr Deputy Speaker, as a member  of the board of governors of Glastry   College. The college is  in my constituency and has an &pound;11 million project for a school newbuild. The  college is oversubscribed by 57 pupils this year, and children are turned away  every year. The feeder schools are full, and enrolment is steady and secure,  yet we are still waiting for the project&rsquo;s start date.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Until now, we have spent &pound;3 million on purchasing land for  the newbuild, on consultation costs and on architect&rsquo;s fees, but the school  still awaits the green light from the Minister. Recently, two meetings about  the newbuild have been cancelled. The school has been left in limbo. It does  not want to patch up the roofs and boilers in the short term at a cost of  thousands of pounds, because it believes that the newbuild will start soon  enough; however, no date has been fixed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I assume that the money is there. The Minister of Education  was confident of having it when she gave the go-ahead to meet the initial  costs. Why has the contract not been allocated? Why have the jobs not been  created? Why are workers not on site?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister must also consider how she allocates her  budget and understand the need to prioritise rather than, with respect,  allocate money to apparently unnecessary and often gratuitous schemes that  reflect her beliefs and affiliations. Those include &pound;20,000 for each of the  four boards for youth clubs and community organisations to promote the Irish  language. When funding is needed for much more important projects, why has that  money been sneaked in the back door?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I ask the Minister to examine that seriously. We need a  fit-for-purpose school that provides quality education to many children. With  great respect, there can be no pet projects. Members are well aware that it is  not my style to attack Ministers. However, I cannot sit here quietly and allow  a debate to take place that highlights the plight of our construction industry  and how to further the education of our children.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I ask the Minister to allocate her funding to provide  institutions that ensure that our children are the best educated in the world  and that they have the facilities required to enhance their education at the  most basic level. The time for point-scoring allocations has passed. The  community that I represent comprises people of all backgrounds who are urging  the Minister to do right by their children and to stop her game playing. Leave  that for children in their playgrounds. I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s  response.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I thank the Members who tabled the motion. The built environment within which  our children study is crucial to their educational experience and their ability  to learn. Schools should be inspiring places in which children and teachers  feel that they can flourish. Unfortunately, for two reasons, that is not the case  in many schools across Northern    Ireland. First, we have a largely  dysfunctional procurement and planning policy; and secondly, we face a growing  financial crisis.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In November 2006, in the Department of Education&rsquo;s review  of public administration policy paper, which was compiled under direct rule,  Ministers outlined problems with the Department&rsquo;s procurement policies, namely  the lack of integration, co-ordination and consistency between the planning  activities of the education authorities; the lack of robust and consistent information  on the condition and suitability of the schools estate; the time taken to  complete economic appraisals in the approval process; the duplication of  activities; and the differences between sectors in how planning and development  matters are resourced and delivered.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: The Member hit on a very important point.  The Minister has put a lot of store in area planning and collaboration, but in  the recent report that the Member will be aware came to the Committee for  Education, it is abundantly clear that area planning is no longer broadly  accepted in the school environment. Furthermore, the entitlement framework  contains other criteria that the Minister uses to determine whether or not a school  will be built. However, she is proposing to take money out of the entitlement  framework, even though it is a statutory obligation that she is supposed to  meet by 2013. Yet she tells us that establishing the education and skills  authority (ESA) is an Executive programme that must be implemented. Obviously,  the Minister does not know what policy suits on any given day of the week.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member has an extra minute.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I am grateful to the Member for his intervention. Indeed, the Minister talks  about her interlinking policies, but when one takes several links out of a  chain, it is not much good to anybody. As the Member pointed out, the picture  is relatively disorganised, particularly with respect to the procurement  policy, which cannot possibly deliver the best value for money or the best  results for our children, teachers, society or, indeed, the economy.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Can anyone honestly say that, in nearly three years of  devolved government, the situation has improved? The ESA and, as the Member  said, area-based planning are in turmoil. Capital projects are under review.  The Minister is making decisions, such as those pertaining to the Middletown  Centre for Autism, there is a completely unacceptable backlog in school  maintenance and, to cap it all, we have run out of money.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Although Mr Lunn is not in his place, will the Member take this opportunity to  clarify the Ulster Unionist Party&rsquo;s position on the ESA?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  As we made clear in the debate last week, of course we are not opposed to the  principle of streamlining education structures. Indeed, Mr McCrea clarified  that point earlier. However, we have consistently opposed the creation of a  super-quango, which the Minister seems intent on doing. We have been rock solid  in opposing that measure, and, until the Minister comes up with something more  in keeping with our views and our policy statements on the issue, we will  continue to oppose it. It is disappointing that Mr Lunn is not in his place.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">During the 2008 strategic stocktake, the Minister of  Education claimed that, in 2010-11, she would need &pound;90 million for capital  projects. The Minister of Finance and Personnel has proposed a further &pound;22  million of cuts to the Department of Education&rsquo;s capital budget next year.  There is a gaping hole in the Minister&rsquo;s capital budget, which means that, in  the foreseeable future, it is very unlikely that any newbuilds will commence.  We must ask ourselves whether that is an acceptable situation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The &lsquo;Investment Strategy for Northern Ireland 2008-2018&rsquo;  states:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Executive is determined that our schools estate  will be redeveloped in time to engage children from all backgrounds &mdash; so that  all are helped to reach their full potential. Our future economic and societal  well-being depends on it.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">It is clear that financial mismanagement,  circumstances and proposals from the Minister of Finance and Personnel have led  to a situation in which developing the schools estate is no longer crucial to  our future economic and societal well-being.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate that we are in a period of fiscal crisis.  However, the Executive are still in a period of crisis in government. Their  lack of collaborative decision-making until now has led us to that point. We  cannot allow the idea that the current financial crisis was inevitable and that  current options are the only ones that are available to prevail.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  Formerly, the issue of the schools estate was one of progression. However,  since the onset of the current economic climate, the progress on newbuilds has  been virtually non-existent. Information on the maintenance of older schools is  frighteningly scant, to say the least. Education is in a state of general confusion.  Some schools&rsquo; physical structure is extremely poor. Overall budgets have been  slashed to nothing. Some schools are in desperate need of repair. It is  worrying when issues such as health and safety are sidelined due to financial  constraints.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In the latest round of cuts, education has taken a &pound;73 million  hit, which is to be achieved through the reduction of current expenditure and  the halting of non-essential capital expenditure. In plain terms, that means  that there will be no newbuilds and a vast reduction in current school budgets  that are already near breaking point.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">DSD, under the stewardship of my colleague and, of course,  my new party leader, Margaret Ritchie, has already evaluated the benefit of  investing in newbuilds at present. Quite frankly, if material and labour costs  have fallen for house building, the same will apply to education newbuilds.  That said, the Minister of Finance and Personnel would no doubt have a line to  dampen that theory and would endeavour to challenge any Member of the House who  dared to ask for more money. He would want us to tell him where he must find  the sum involved and which Department&rsquo;s budget should suffer in order to  increase the coffers of another. Perhaps he did not receive my party&rsquo;s  document, &lsquo;New Priorities&rsquo;, which, in fact, tells him where he can find &pound;400  million without inflicting any more stress on Departments.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I do not want to detract from the motion&rsquo;s seriousness. I  am sure that there are schools in every Member&rsquo;s constituency that are in need  of essential repair or a complete newbuild.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister of Education will be well aware of the  problems around services for pupils and the extreme pressure that special-needs  delivery is under. I assure the House that the Committee ensures that she is  well informed of our concerns in all aspects of education, not least the education  budget forecasts for the new financial year. It is with that in mind that I  hope that she will respond positively to the motion and petition the Minister  of Finance and Personnel to ensure that a formal and effective procurement plan  and mechanism are implemented in order to, at least, ease the burden on some  schools that are in need of essential repair or, as I said, newbuilds, at the  earliest possible date.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">All Members have such schools in their constituencies. I  certainly do in my area, where lots of schools need lots of repairs. A  controlled primary school in my area has been waiting for years to be rebuilt.  It owns the land beside the school. Plans to rebuild have been with the  Department for many years. I want to see them come to fruition.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is essential that the Minister of Education oversees  schools that are fit for purpose in the twenty-first century. Young people  deserve every chance and facility that it is possible to give, so that they all  reach their optimum potential. Education is the only avenue that is open to  many children and young people who are caught in the poverty trap. It is  essential that we do everything that is physically possible to make that learning  process safe and enjoyable. I support the motion.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Ba mhaith liom mo thaca&iacute;ocht in  i&uacute;l don r&uacute;n.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion. Of course, the Assembly &mdash; an Tion&oacute;l  seo &mdash; must work extremely hard to ensure that the Minister of Education has  adequate funds with which to upgrade the schools estate and make it fit for the  twenty-first century. I agree with that absolutely. Of course, the Assembly  must take into account the financial difficulties in her Department and the  wider Executive. Like Mitchel McLaughlin, I hope that parties who have spoken  strongly this afternoon will support Caitr&iacute;ona Ruane when she makes bids in  monitoring rounds, etc, for additional funding that might become available.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: The Member is asking us to support the  Minister in her monitoring round bids, but the same Minister surrendered &pound;9  million because her Department could not spend it owing to technical issues.  Therefore, how can he expect Members on this side of the House to support a  Minister who is not even capable of managing the financial resources that she  has?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member has an extra minute to speak.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Thank you very much, Francie &mdash; I mean, Deputy Speaker. As I understand it, the  Minister of Education has been following the normal financial rules. As  Chairperson of the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure, I know that there  is a much greater culture of underspend under a DUP Minister in the Department  of Culture, Arts and Leisure. Therefore, it is a cross-departmental problem.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  The Member has asked us all to support the Minister of Education in getting  more money to tackle this important issue. Can I rely on his support, and will  he speak to his deputy First Minister and other three Ministers, to ensure that  they are all batting for education and that those Ministries will also  surrender funds to protect our children?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Certainly. It would help if Mr McCrea put that proposition in writing to me,  and I will give it due consideration.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mervyn Storey asked a number of specific questions about North Antrim, and fair play to him. In my constituency, I  am anxious that Dean   Maguirc College  in Carrickmore overcomes uncertainty over legal issues and precise site  selection to gain absolute assurance about its future. I take this opportunity  to commend the Minister and her Department for the tremendous work that was  achieved in replacing the previous site of Drumragh  Integrated College  in Omagh, which was the old building at the Tyrone and Fermanagh Hospital.  The college has moved into a beautiful newbuild school in Omagh, and I know  that the principal, Nigel Frith, and the students are delighted with it. One of  the students is on work experience with me this week &mdash; young Conall Campbell &mdash;  and he is very pleased with his new school environment, because he has  witnessed both settings: the old building at the Tyrone and Fermanagh Hospital  and the new Drumragh Integrated College. That is very good.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  In the interests of equality across West Tyrone and South Down, would the  Member like to add to his list Down High School and Blackwater Integrated   College?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  That is self-evident. The Member has spoken, and he has spoken well. I commend  him for taking the opportunity to highlight constituency concerns. I would be very  disappointed in him if he did not do that in this setting, so congratulations;  well done.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Lisanelly education campus in Omagh represents another  major project. I commend the Minister for her personal interest in that  visionary project, and I wish her all the best with taking that forward.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We want to hear about how the Minister&rsquo;s Department has  responded, and is responding, to the construction industry crisis. I want to  know the Department of Education&rsquo;s response to that, because every Department  is charged with responding appropriately. Does the procurement policy provide  opportunities for local companies that are hard pressed at this time? Does it  provide opportunities for the long-term unemployed and for apprentices from  socially deprived areas?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">One sector that has not been mentioned during this debate  is Irish-medium schools. I feel that there are a disproportionate number of  mobile huts on those sites, and I would like to see a systematic programme for  taking the Irish-medium sector forward into proper, newly built schools. Go  raibh maith agat.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education (Ms Ruane)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Cuirim  f&aacute;ilte roimh an deis an cheist seo a phl&eacute; inniu, mar creidim go daingean go  gcaithfimid infheisti&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh san east&aacute;t oideachais leis an timpealleacht  cheart a shol&aacute;thar le gur f&eacute;idir eisp&eacute;ireas oideachas&uacute;il ardchaighde&aacute;in a  thabhairt do dhaoine &oacute;ga.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Today&rsquo;s debate focuses on the continued need for newbuilds  and ongoing maintenance in the schools estate, primarily to ensure the  provision of a schools estate that is fit for the twenty-first century, and  calls on Members to recognise the resulting additional economic benefit through  the creation of jobs in the construction industry. I welcome the opportunity to  debate the issue with Members, because I firmly believe that, as a priority, we  must invest in our education estate to provide the right environment for the  delivery of a high-quality educational experience for all our young people,  with equality at its core.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The context in which the schools estate is managed and  delivered is complex. We have a large schools estate, which is managed by a  wide range of sectoral interests, and a history of significant underinvestment.  I join Trevor Lunn in saying that the ESA should be a priority for the  Assembly, and I hope that it will be. I note the zigzagging and shifting of  various political parties, and that is to be welcomed. It is good when people  change their minds about things that should have happened.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As a result of that history of underachievement, a  significant proportion of the schools estate does not meet the current schools  building handbook standards. Investment in our schools estate is recognised in  the Executive&rsquo;s 10-year investment strategy, which states that &pound;3&middot;5 billion of  capital will be made available for investment in our education infrastructure  in the period 2008-2018. In recognition of that, the Executive allocated &pound;700  million over the current Budget period to enable over 100 major school projects  to be taken forward. Add to that the outcome of the Irish-medium review, which  was held since that allocation was made. Barry McElduff&rsquo;s point was well made.  Schools in the Irish-medium sector and the integrated sector are among the  sectors that have prefabs for classrooms. In some cases, the entire school is  in prefabs. We need to take that on board.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If someone arrived from Mars and listened to the debate, he  or she could be forgiven for thinking that nothing has happened in the schools  estate in the past two years.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Yes.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Some Members do not know what has happened. I will give some  examples, because it is easy to be critical. Abbey Christian Brothers&rsquo; School  in Newry has a new school, as has Ashfield Girls&rsquo; High School, which I visited  recently. It has a beautiful new school, and &pound;23&middot;4 million was spent on it. A  replacement school was built for Ballymacricket  Primary School in Glenavy; &pound;23&middot;8  million was spent on a replacement school for Bangor  Academy; &pound;5&middot;4 million was spent on Brookfield Special Primary School;  and &pound;15&middot;2 million was spent on a replacement school for De La Salle College in  the west of the city. Drumragh   Integrated College  has been mentioned, so I will not mention it again. A new replacement school  was built for Glendhu Nursery School, and a beautiful school was built for  the Holy Cross College  in Tyrone. It is ready for the next generation, and it is operating on an  all-ability, co-educational basis. Some &pound;7 million was invested in Orangefield  Primary School; &pound;5&middot;3 million in Pond Park Primary School; &pound;0&middot;7 million in an  extension of the Irish-medium unit at St Catherine&rsquo;s College; &pound;3&middot;5 million in  St Colman&rsquo;s College; &pound;1&middot;8 million in St Patrick&rsquo;s Primary School in Saul; &pound;3&middot;6  million in St Peter&rsquo;s Primary School, Cloughreagh; and &pound;4&middot;4 million in  Templepatrick. Work was done at Towerview   Primary School as well.  The list goes on.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I will not give way; no Member acknowledged the work that is  going on. Let us look at some of the projects that are on-site. Work is ongoing  at Assumption Grammar   School, various post-primary facilities, Ballysillan youth  club and Banbridge   Academy. Some &pound;32&middot;8  million is being spent on Belfast Boys&rsquo; Model School.  Investment has also been made in Belfast Model School for Girls; Lisbellaw  Primary School; Lisnagelvin; Our Lady and St Patrick&rsquo;s; St Cecilia&rsquo;s College;  St Mary&rsquo;s College; St Joseph&rsquo;s Primary School; St Mary&rsquo;s Primary School &mdash; the  list goes on and on.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Basil McCrea will be aware that the most recent investment  was made in Magherafelt   High School. In fact,  representatives from that school are here today. Some &pound;11&middot;5 million is being  invested in a replacement building for the school. St Patrick&rsquo;s Grammar School  in Downpatrick, which is locally known as &ldquo;the Red High&rdquo;, has received  investment of &pound;16&middot;8 million.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Let us look at things in the round, rather than being  selective. A total of &pound;427 million is being invested in the schools estate.  Since taking up my role as Minister of Education, I have been at pains to  ensure that we fully utilise the capital funds that are available to improve  the condition of the schools estate. In 2008-09, my Department&rsquo;s capital spend  was in excess of &pound;199 million, which represented 99% of the final budget  position. In the current year, 2009-2010, the Department is on track to spend  its capital budget.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to remind Members that the Department&rsquo;s  capital budget does not merely cover the construction of new schools; it also  covers investment in transport, youth and early years, minor works in schools  and several other capital requirements. Members should note that, if we are  serious about dealing with climate change and reducing wastage in the transport  system, transfer 2010 is the best option. Rather than the parties on the  opposite Benches trying to block progress and pointing the finger, we must have  real debates on such issues.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: Will the Minister give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: No, I will not. There is no doubt that, in a climate of  ever-tightening budgets and with all Departments having to find savings, the  situation is difficult. I look forward to the support of the parties opposite  and on this side of the House when I seek more money for capital build  projects. Some parties act as the opposition in the Executive and claim that  they do not have enough money, and their colleagues try to cause difficulties  for other Departments.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am reviewing capital projects because I want to ensure  that the investment in the education estate is consistent with and supportive  of the entire policy framework, including the statutory duties on equality and  targeting on the basis of objective need. In the current economic climate, the  review will ensure that the available resources are used to secure the best  outcomes for children and maximum value for every taxpayer. In light of that,  it is important that we validate that the projects in which we invest are  viable in the long term. We must ensure that they are targeted on the basis of  need and that equality is at their core.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I commissioned a review of current capital works to ensure  that they are all consistent with the overall policy framework. That will not  be a protracted exercise, but Members will appreciate that major capital invest&shy;ment  must be based on robust, defensible and consistent decisions. Such investment  must be able to support important areas, such as raising standards for all,  closing the gap in achievement by improving access to equality and improving  the learning environment.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We must take into account the reviews of special  educational needs and Irish-medium. The capital review will inform a more  strategic approach to capital investment decisions and the management of the  schools estates. In common with other Members, I would like to have additional  funds to invest in the infrastructure of schools. I look forward to the support  of the Committee for Education and my Executive colleagues from all parties in  securing those funds. Every Member is concerned about certain schools in his or  her constituency. It is important that those schools receive the support that  they deserve.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The current estimate for completing the remaining list of  projects is more than &pound;600 million, and that does not take into account the  additional major projects that are in the pipeline. Lisanelly is a key priority  for me and my Department, and people will have noted its inclusion in Gordon  Brown&rsquo;s letter. Lisanelly represents the way forward for Omagh, and I chair a  working group that is examining that issue.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The schools estate has a significant maintenance backlog,  which is currently estimated to be in the region of &pound;278 million, and getting  money for the maintenance of schools is a good way to kick-start the  construction industry and support local companies. In the current financial  year, I have allocated and spent in the region of &pound;82 million on minor works  across the estate. In the same period, the education and library boards  allocated &pound;26&middot;5 million to maintenance, including an additional &pound;5 million that  I allocated in-year in recognition of the need to address underinvestment in  schools.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am acutely aware of the additional economic benefit of  creating jobs in the construction industry and the need to expedite taking  capital projects to the market. To support the local construction industry, my  Department and I fully committed the capital budget available to me and  maximised the investment in the schools estate. If I am given more, I will be  happy to spend it and continue that investment.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">One of my objectives is to achieve a system of strong,  sustainable schools planned on an area basis and to move away from the way in  which things were done previously. In the past, there was no proper area-based  planning or decision-making process. As a result, some schools are empty only a  couple of years after they were built. We are doing things differently now.  Sustainable schools are a key element of the policy framework that I am putting  in place, at the heart of which is &lsquo;Every School a Good School&rsquo;; the  Irish-medium review; the revised curriculum; the entitlement framework; and  equality duties and targeting on the basis of need.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I do not want to name people, but it is disappointing to  hear some Members criticising the funding of the Irish-medium sector. I thought  that we had moved beyond that, but, obviously, we have not. The Irish-medium  sector deserves to be treated on the basis of equality, which it will be by my  Department and me.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I fully support and am the lead advocate for the need to  provide a schools estate that is fit for the twenty-first century, and my  Department and I have fully utilised the funding that is available to do that.  I also support the need to ensure that a procurement mechanism is put in place  to expedite the provision of capital works, and my Department and I are also  doing everything in our power to deliver on that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Aonta&iacute;m go huile is go hioml&aacute;n gur ch&oacute;ir cisti&uacute;  leordh&oacute;thanach a bheith ar f&aacute;il le scoileanna a chotabh&aacute;il ag na caighde&aacute;in is  airde. Thug m&eacute; cuairt ar roinnt mhaith scoileanna ar fud an Tuaiscirt agus  tuigim r&iacute;mhaith an g&aacute; at&aacute; ann le n&iacute;os m&oacute; infheisti&uacute; caipitil in east&aacute;t na  scoileanna.

      <p class="B3BodyText">I totally agree that adequate funding must be provided to  maintain our schools to the highest possible standards. I have visited many  schools throughout the North and am acutely aware of the need for enhanced  capital investment in the schools estate. I will continue to advocate the need  for that with my Executive colleagues.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I thank all Members and parties for supporting the motion and for their contributions  to the debate.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Many Members agreed on several points. We agreed that we  want investment in our schools estate; we want the best learning environment  for our students and young people; and we will all work to ensure that as many  capital projects as possible are realised to help the construction industry.  However, many Members were concerned about the review of capital spend that the  Minister informed the House about last year. I am sure that, like me, Members  were disappointed that the Minister did not tell the House about the criteria  for that, other than there being a need for equality and objective need. That  is a bit strange coming from a Minister whose party has just sold out on  equality at Hillsborough, where it colluded with other parties to deny a  nationalist the justice Ministry and a seat at the Executive table. Equality  from Sinn F&eacute;in? What that party used to call discrimination and gerrymandering,  it now calls a historic breakthrough.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: Does the Member agree that it is not the  first time that Sinn F&eacute;in has adopted double standards on the issue of  equality? The Minister of Education repeatedly tells the House that equality is  at the core of everything that she does. However, let me inform the House that  the reason why ESA is not coming back is that the Minister cannot deliver  equality. She has insulted the controlled sector and the transferors, which is  yet another example of a Minister who wants equality only on her terms rather  than on the basis of treating everybody equally and fairly.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Is it not important that Members who  contribute to the debate do so accurately? There is no public record of the  transferors or any other sector having registered a complaint about the  Minister insulting them.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: That is not a point of order. However, I am sure that the point  has been made.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I take the point that was made by the Chairperson of the Committee for  Education.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">With the exception of Sinn F&eacute;in, all the parties are doing  sterling work in trying to reach a compromise agreement on the way forward for  transferors.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I assure the Chairperson and others that the SDLP will take  no lectures on equality from Members to my right.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Of course.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  thank the Member for giving way. She may be mistaken, because the agreement on  how the new justice Minister will be elected was not made at Hillsborough; it  was voted for in the Chamber. I remind Mrs Kelly that the SDLP voted for those  new arrangements.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I am glad that Mr O&rsquo;Dowd made that point, because I heard him on &lsquo;The Stephen  Nolan Show&rsquo; giving the same spin. The SDLP proposed amendments to the  Department of Justice Bill, but those amendments were voted down by Sinn F&eacute;in,  which is engaged in gerrymandering.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. Members are straying from the subject and should return to  the debate.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I will get back to Members&rsquo; contributions. Mr Bradley said that there was a  &pound;240 million maintenance backlog in the schools estate. When considering the  condition of equipment or the structure of our homes, there comes a time when  one realises that one is throwing good money after bad and one has to make a  sensible decision on the best way to invest.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McCallister made the point &mdash; I cannot recall the title  of the report that he mentioned &mdash; that some units in the Department of  Education were working in silos and that there was no co-ordinated and collaborative  approach to getting the best with the budget that we have. That is  disappointing, and I hope that the Minister will address those concerns.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Another common thread was procurement. I understand that  many procurement matters are not the fault of the Minister; legal challenges  held up some decisions. We have to be honest and accept that. However, it now  falls to the Minister, in consultation with the Minister of Finance and  Personnel, to find a way out of that maze and see whether we can ensure that  contracts that are still outstanding are soon advertised and tendered for in a  fair and equitable way. Many young people and families who depended on the  construction industry, either for direct labour or through services provided,  are suffering. We need to get to grips with that issue.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It was interesting to hear Mr Barry McElduff tell us how  pleased the student who is on placement with him this week is with his school.  However, I was told that soil would be turned over in December 2008 for  building projects in some of the schools in my area of Lurgan; for example, in Tannaghmore Primary School. It never happened. Every  time one asks a question of the Minister, the goal posts change. Either the  economic appraisal was not right, the money is not there, the business case has  to be deferred or, more recently, it is tied into the entitlement framework  arrangements. There is a total lack of clarity in the House &mdash; we cannot get  direct answers from the Minister &mdash; and, more importantly, there is a lack of  information and clarity being provided to the boards and management committees  of all schools.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is very telling indeed that, two and half years on,  people still do not know what will happen to their local primary school.  Schools are not just centres of education; in many rural areas, they are used  as community centres. When deciding on a school for their child, people need  surety on whether it has a future, as the Minister has still not made a  decision on the Bain recommendations.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Members asked where the funding will come from, and  challenged the House to support the Minister in making a bid to the Minister of  Finance and Personnel for additional funding. However, the Chairperson of the  Committee for Education pointed out that &pound;9 million was surrendered, and some  Members did not have the confidence that, if the Minister were to receive  additional funding, that money would be able to be spent. The Committee and the  Minister must get to grips with what is going on to allow &pound;9 million to be  surrendered in such tight fiscal times.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A few eyebrows were raised around the Chamber when some  Members, particularly those from the Sinn F&eacute;in Benches, criticised parties that  had asked for more services but did not say that their party colleagues in the  Executive should surrender their moneys. Mr Basil McCrea pointed out that, in  the next debate, Sinn F&eacute;in will call for additional services, and that  hypocrisy speaks for itself.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The debate has highlighted some key issues of critical  concern, not least to parents and children, about the school environment and  newbuilds. Questions remain unanswered, and I have no doubt that the Committee  will take those forward, as it has done in the past, for the Minister to  answer. Certainly, no answers were given here this afternoon.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly notes the need for newbuild and ongoing  maintenance to ensure provision of a schools estate fit for the twenty-first  century; recognises the additional economic benefit of construction industry  job creation; and calls on the Minister of Education and the Minister of  Finance and Personnel to ensure that a procurement mechanism is in place, which  expedites the provision of capital projects, and that adequate funds are  provided to maintain our schools to the highest possible standards.</p>

      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly recognises that the provision of perinatal  psychiatric services is lacking; and calls on the Minister of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety to ensure that mentally ill mothers and their babies  are protected through the establishment of recognised structures for the  provision of mental health care in pregnancy.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The perinatal mental health period spans from conception to  two years after the birth of the child, and it is during that period that women  are most likely to be admitted to psychiatric hospital and are at increased  risk of experiencing the effects of mental illness. Women with a pre-existing  mental illness are more prone to relapse or reoccurrence of the conditions.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There are four main areas where services fall short of  expected standards or where provision is lacking: lack of specialist services,  including mother-and-baby units; failure to identify risk factors; inadequate treatment  of severe disorders; and lack of co-ordination between services. Importantly,  nurses and other health professionals remain unclear about their roles and  responsibilities in managing perinatal mental health problems. The Committee  for Health, Social Services and Public Safety took evidence from individuals  who have an interest in and who share concerns about the provision or  non-provision of those services.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Suicide is now the most common cause of maternal death. The  management of post-natal depression requires a multi-disciplinary approach, and  that is supported by the recently published National Institute for Health and  Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines on antenatal and post-natal care for  women, which set out a number of key priority areas for improved service  frameworks and pathways. Key roles are included for midwives, psychiatrists,  health visitors, obstetricians, gynaecologists and GPs. Clear pathways that all  professionals recognise are needed so that any woman who presents in danger is  looked after to the highest standards and given appropriate interventions where  necessary.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Although suicide is the most common cause of maternal  death, it is a hidden problem in society. It is the biggest indirect killer of  pregnant women and of women who have given birth recently. For various reasons,  such as protecting the surviving child, the issue is a somewhat taboo subject.  By tabling the motion, we aim to draw the House&rsquo;s attention to the issue and to  call on the Minister to ensure that appropriate support is available for the  people who need the service.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The birth of a child is a critical period for any family.  It is a period of great joy, but it can also be one of great distress. There is  no doubt that after delivery, mothers are at increased risk of psychiatric  conditions that affect not only them but the whole family. The Committee for  Health, Social Services and Public Safety was told by the only psychiatrist who  specialises in perinatal mental health, Dr Janine Lynch, that long-term mental  health and psychological adjustment are influenced by an individual&rsquo;s early  environment as well as his or her genes. Therefore, proper intervention would  reduce instances of maternal illness, and that would have a beneficial effect  on mothers and their children&rsquo;s future psychological health.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bamford review identified eight groups of people who  have highly specialised mental health needs, and it recommended service  developments for each of those groups. One of those groups consists of the  people who use perinatal services.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In the Executive response to the Bamford review, one of the  suggestions was that those specialist services should be addressed as time and  resources permit. Perhaps the Minister will tell us today whether his  Department has taken forward any of that work and what, if any, progress has  been made in protecting vulnerable women and their families.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to make it clear that not all women who need  perinatal support are at the severe end of what is a spectrum. The spectrum  ranges from mild, benign and self-limiting baby blues through anxiety and  depression to a severe illness called puerperal psychosis. At one end of the  spectrum, all that is required is simple reassurance; at the other, hospital  admission and specialist treatment are required. In between, there is a mixed  bag of diagnoses. Most of the support can be provided in the primary-care  setting so long as staff receive adequate training and support from secondary  providers.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Some time ago, the Committee heard at first hand how  frustrated staff were, to say the least, at the lack of services for women with  perinatal mental illness. Surely, if staff on the front line are making those  statements, we need to listen and act sooner rather than later. There are  well-developed services in Scotland,  England and Wales, but,  unfortunately, services on the whole of this island are underdeveloped. The  services that have been developed in those countries include a number of  mother-and-baby units, and I had the good fortune of visiting such a unit in Glasgow. In Scotland, it is  enshrined in law that mentally ill women have the right to be admitted with  their babies for specialist treatment for a time. When I spoke directly to  women in those mother-and-baby units, they said that not having their child  with them would have had a further detrimental effect on their mental health  and recovery period.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, nowhere on this island can a woman be admitted  with her baby for psychiatric treatment. Given the tight budget restraints, I  suggest to the Minister that he explore the mechanisms of the North/South  Ministerial Council as a way of developing services in the most efficient  manner.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Services here in the North lag well behind in the provision  of perinatal psychiatry. We have no recognised structure for the provision of  mental health care during pregnancy, and although there is good practice among  individuals, services are patchy and inconsistent. There is no regional  development strategy. I am aware that the Minister is due to produce a  maternity services strategy shortly, and, hopefully, it will have some  reference to perinatal services. Perhaps the Minister will advise us on whether  that is the case in his contribution to the debate.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I noted in the research pack that there is an indentified  care pathway in the Western Trust, and I commend that. However, I can only  assume that there are no identified care pathways in any of the other trusts,  given that there was no mention of them.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, we need a strategy for that specialist  service to protect those women and their families when they need it most. We  should not allow perinatal depression to be a hidden problem any longer. We  need to identify the gaps and implement strategies and supports for those who  are providing services on the front line. I urge Members to support the motion.  Go raibh maith agat.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>: I  support the motion as it highlights the need for action on an important  subject. The Bamford review, which was published in 2005, highlighted some  serious irregularities in mental health services as a whole. Unfortunately, the  Bamford review has yet to be fully implemented. The report highlighted the  importance of care for mothers and described childbirth as a time when mothers  are vulnerable to becoming severely mentally ill. Time is of the essence in  implementing those changes, and the Committee is always there to help the  Minister to achieve what is best for the people of the Province. Having a baby  is usually associated with much joy and happiness, but, unfortunately, that is  not the case for many new mothers.</p>
      <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr McClarty] in the Chair)</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Psychiatric disorders contribute to 12% of maternal deaths,  with suicide being the leading cause; about 10% of all recently delivered  mothers have a major depressive illness. Those are depressing statistics, but  they highlight the importance of the issue. We need to do everything in our  power to ensure that mothers and mothers-to-be receive the necessary help, care  and support from the Health Service.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We hear much about post-natal depression, but many members  of the public are unfamiliar with the term &ldquo;perinatal depression&rdquo;. It refers to  the period in and around childbirth &mdash; a crucial moment between mother and baby.  It is important that mothers-to-be are looked after in the period leading up  to, and after, childbirth. As with many areas of the Health Service, research  has shown that there is a need for a multidisciplinary team approach to the care  of a mother should she show signs of depression or any other sort of  psychiatric behaviour. According to the charity Mind, health professionals are  unprepared for providing the necessary psychological help and support to  mothers, and that is very worrying.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">5.00 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am concerned that there is no mother and baby unit in Northern Ireland,  and I wonder why that is. Furthermore, it is a concern that, with so much  pressure on hospitals, mothers who are about to give birth are generally rushed  in and out of hospital, usually on the same day. A baby may be delivered  safely, and mother and baby may be physically well, but the mother&rsquo;s state of  mind, and how she is coping after the birth, must be looked at. Having a baby  is a life-changing experience, with major physical and psychological  consequences for which a mother-to-be may not be prepared. With the focus  usually on the baby, a mother can sometimes feel ignored or can put on a brave  face. We must ensure that mothers are OK, and that they get the support and care  that they need.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mothers with psychiatric problems should not be subject to  long waiting lists for treatment, because the early days of a child&rsquo;s life are  very important for the mother and the baby. I join my colleagues from the  Health Committee who proposed the motion in their call on the Minister of  Health to ensure that mentally ill mothers and their babies are protected  through established structures that ensure their care and safety. Mothers, and  the care of children, are vital to the future of our society. I support the  motion.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  The SDLP supports the motion. Across the continent, suicide remains the biggest  indirect killer of pregnant women and those who have just given birth. That  there is no provision for perinatal mental illness on the island worth talking  about is a matter that deserves the attention of the Assembly and, therefore, I  commend Mrs O&rsquo;Neill and her colleagues for tabling the motion. I want to take  the opportunity to apologise to Mrs O&rsquo;Neill for being late and missing the  beginning of her speech.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is a black hole in policy. There is no joined-up  thinking with regard to women or the process of bringing a child into the  world. Pregnancy is a time in a woman&rsquo;s life that should be filled with  profound joy and a great sense of purpose; it is the fulfilment of their very  being. However, it can become a living nightmare that often goes undiagnosed,  and, when diagnosed, is unable to be treated properly because it is not an  option to provide a pregnant woman with medical treatment that might involve  antidepressants. That is a further concern. That is particularly worrying given  that we know that the problem exists. The Bamford review identified the problem  and set out specific recommendations on what to do about it. However, progress  on the implementation of the recommendations remains painfully slow.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly will note with grave concern that there is not  a single perinatal mental health bed in the region or anywhere else on the  island. It is surely a failure of society, and of the regional Government, that  women continue to find that they are unable to seek answers to what is going on  in their bodies and in their minds, not just during pregnancy, but afterwards,  and in the early years of their child&rsquo;s life.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am happy to support the motion. It is important that the  House send a signal that the care of pregnant women is something that is as  precious to us as the life that lies within them.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  The motion is yet another example of a wish-list motion from Sinn F&eacute;in: the  party that calls for big new spending on health, yet votes for a Budget that  cuts back on the Health Department&rsquo;s spending. If Sinn F&eacute;in was serious about  providing all the services that it has called for, it would not have voted for  a Budget that puts the Health Service &pound;600 million behind the rest of the United Kingdom.  We will all watch with interest when the time comes for Sinn F&eacute;in to vote for  the additional &pound;113 million of cuts to the health budget, as planned by the  Finance Minister.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion raises an issue that I have raised before. It is  wrong for a party to propose motions that involve additional public spending  without identifying, even in broad terms, where it would find the money to  finance such proposals.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">No one objects to an extension of perinatal services. An  extension is needed; the Bamford review recommended one, and we would all like  to see one. I am sure that the Minister would like to provide an extension, but  where is he to find the money to fund one? Where is he to find the money in a  climate where the DUP Finance Minister, Sammy Wilson, is proposing to cut  another &pound;113 million from the health budget? That is the heart of the matter.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The time has come for a more reasonable attitude to the  motions that are brought before the Assembly. The motion is just another cheap  headline for Sinn F&eacute;in, which is the party that voted for health cuts. That is  the terrible reality. To call for more services and budget cuts at the same  time is complete humbug.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I am a wee bit taken aback by Mr Gardiner&rsquo;s comments. However, people are  entitled to their opinions.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the motion and support it on behalf of the United  Community. In doing so, I fully acknowledge the excellent work that is carried  out throughout Northern    Ireland by our Health Service; long may it  continue.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I totally agree with the sentiment of the motion.  Regardless of what Mr Gardiner said, there is obviously a need for some  provision along the lines stated in the motion. I hope that the Minister, who  is in the Chamber, can offer such services to all who are in need of them as  soon as possible.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  I add my support to this timely motion. Like Mr McCarthy, I am taken aback by  the lack of compassion from Sam Gardiner on such an important issue. It is  important that the Assembly recognises that there is a gap in perinatal  psychiatric services provided by the Health Service in Northern Ireland,  because only then will steps be taken to improve those services.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Although the arrival of a newborn child is always a joy and  delight for any parent, it must be recognised that there are those who suffer  from mental health problems during pregnancy and up to two years after the  birth of the child. Depression and anxiety are common symptoms during pregnancy  and after childbirth, and it is estimated that one in 10 pregnant women in  developed countries suffer significant mental health problems.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Both the NICE guidelines on antenatal and post-natal care  and the Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries (CMACE) report, &lsquo;Saving  Mothers&rsquo; Lives&rsquo;, show the importance of early identification of women at risk.  The guidelines and the report have also outlined the clear role for public  health nurses in identifying risk factors and providing early interventions  through the promotion of partnerships with midwives, GPs, Sure Start and mental  health colleagues.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">At one end of the spectrum, simple reassurance is all that  is required, while at the other, hospital admission and specialised treatment  are necessary. Therefore, most interventions can be provided within the primary  care setting, as long as adequate training is in place and the required support  for the secondary services is provided. That will mean that specialist services  are only needed to treat those with more serious depressive disorders.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There are well-developed services in England, Scotland  and Wales,  including a number of mother-and-baby units. It is disappointing and  unacceptable that Northern    Ireland lags behind in such provision, with  no recognised structure for the provision of mental health care during  pregnancy and no specialised facility for the admission of mentally ill women  and their babies, despite the Bamford review clearly recommending that  perinatal services be provided as a specialism.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Royal College of Nursing recommends that all women with  perinatal psychiatric disorder who require specialist psychiatric care should  have access to a consultant and other mental health professionals irrespective  of their place of residence. Moreover, it believes that proper protocols should  be in place in every maternity service for the management of women who are at  risk of a relapse into a serious mental illness after delivery. I remind the  Minister that that includes County   Tyrone, an area in which  no maternity service is available. That is blatant inequality and  discrimination. Children from the county have had their identities stripped  from them. The House should take cognisance of the fact that there is no  provision enabling a child to be born in County Tyrone.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have outlined views that have been expressed by Health  Service professionals. Those people are at the cutting edge. Therefore, I ask  the Minister to take cognisance of that fact and, as the motion outlines, take  steps to establish recognised structures for the provision of mental health  care during and after pregnancy. I support the motion.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I attended an event in my  constituency on Thursday that was organised by the Patient and Client Council.  It was a very welcome event. During the question and answer session, a young  mother spoke about her first pregnancy during which she was feeling down, and a  health professional prescribed sleeping tablets for her. As I listened to her,  I could see that that young woman is still anxious, though it has been some  time since she had her first child. She told the people at the event that she  had not been tired and it was not that she did not want to go to sleep. She had  been trying to say that she needed reassurance and professional medical help,  which she did not receive.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I saw the Minister&rsquo;s press release when he launched the  mental health and learning disability action plan, and it referred to the  Patient and Client Council, and I did think that the event was an example of  where the plan was working. However, in advance of today&rsquo;s debate, it struck me  that although there was perhaps no simple way to deal with the young woman&rsquo;s  problem, the solution was not to prescribe sleeping tablets to her. There is a  need for services and structures.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I listened to Mr Gardiner, and I am one of the people in  Sinn F&eacute;in who brought the motion to the House. However, I did not recognise  myself in Mr Gardiner&rsquo;s comments.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  I have no problem with the motion. If the finance is available, I am quietly  confident that the Minister will want to introduce the service. However, the  finances must be made available, and the health budget should not be reduced  every time cuts are made. I have no problem with the idea. I will support it,  encourage it and encourage the Minister to implement it if the funding is  available. The funding is my problem.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  I thank the Member for his intervention. I will quote from the Minister&rsquo;s press  release, which is insightful.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is particularly apt, given Mr Gardiner&rsquo;s intervention.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">5.15 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Minister McGimpsey said that:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;I was able to secure additional resources for mental  health and learning disability and all of the actions in the Plan can be  delivered within our existing resources.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I know that there is a difficulty with budgets, and  I understand what Mr Gardiner is saying. The Minister talked about using the  resources in the existing budget. However, we still have to find a way to  deliver for the woman whom I mentioned at the beginning of my speech. I do not  think that it would take all that much more money.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for Health, Social  Services and Public Safety, Michelle O&rsquo;Neill, referred to the Western Health  and Social Care Trust&rsquo;s action plan, which is to do with professional training.  That is a good idea; if that had been in place when the mother whom I spoke  about was offered sleeping tablets, the staff would have been better placed and  better skilled to deal with the situation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I read the minutes of the Health Committee&rsquo;s meeting of 17  April 2008 at which Breedagh Hughes of the Royal College of Midwives, a Dr  Janine Lynch and others made a presentation. Neither I nor Mr Gardiner were  members of the Committee at that time. Anyone who has doubts about the motion  should read those minutes. In my view, the evidence that was presented at that  meeting was very convincing about what we need to do. Go raibh maith agat, a  LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  I am pleased to be able to speak on this motion. On 17 April 2008, the  Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety took evidence from  representatives of the Royal College of Midwives on the matter of perinatal  psychiatry care. At that meeting, the Committee was told that suicide is the  biggest indirect cause of death among pregnant women. We have heard many  Members say the same thing today. Suicide is especially prevalent among women  who have just given birth. The Committee was also told that suicide is a hidden  killer in pregnancy. Many people have no idea that that is such an issue.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The point of the Health Service, and, indeed, the welfare  state, is to provide a support mechanism to the population to ensure that  society does all that it can to help those who need help. It is clear that  perinatal mental health services is an area in which women need the help that  the Health Service can provide. The Bamford review of Mental Health and  Learning Disability (Northern    Ireland) considered that issue and reported  with several recommendations.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion calls on the Minister to implement changes in  the structures of the provision of mental healthcare for pregnant women. We  will hear from the Minister a bit later about what he is doing, and has done,  on the reform of mental healthcare. However, I say to the proposers of the  motion that they also have a role in helping to make that happen. We must, in  this House, work to protect the health budget. I say that because there is a  silent killer out there, and we are debating it today. If we are to protect the  vulnerable and provide support to those who need it, we know that our Health  Service needs the resources to deal with those issues.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with the proposers of the motion that resources  must go into the development of services for pregnant women. The case for that  has been made well and cannot be ignored. However, I also believe that the  health budget is overstretched. Healthcare in Northern Ireland is appallingly  underfunded. The pressures on the health budget make developing services in the  Health Service extremely difficult; indeed, almost impossible.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I do not intend to oppose what is a very pertinent motion.  However, I suggest to its proposers that they need to look at the bigger  problem that the Minister is facing. Perhaps they should, in fact, table  motions that are relevant to the Minister of Finance and Personnel, calling for  him to properly resource the health budget.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bamford review recommended the implementation of a  clear regional strategy and a specialist perinatal mental health service.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I would very much like to see that come to pass. I would  like to see all the recommendations of the Bamford review implemented. However,  we must recognise that we are still waiting for those elements of the review  that have not been implemented to be put into operation. They have not been  implemented not because there is a lack of political will; it is because there  is a lack of funds.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: I thank the  Members who tabled the motion for raising this important issue. The mental  well-being of every mother throughout her pregnancy and after giving birth is  important for the mother, her baby and other family members.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE)  states that perinatal mental health relates to the time that a woman is  pregnant and the first year of a baby&rsquo;s life. It covers a wide range of  conditions that can affect women during and after pregnancy. That includes  everything from mild anxiety, or baby blues, to severe depression and psychotic  conditions. For most mothers, having mild symptoms or feeling low during or  after pregnancy does not last very long. However, for some, those symptoms can  persist and worsen and can have a significant impact on their daily lives. Some  need professional help.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is estimated that as many as one in 10 women experiences  a mental health problem during pregnancy or in the post-natal period. There are  25,000 births a year in Northern    Ireland. That means that 2,500 newly  pregnant women may need support during and after pregnancy. Of those, a small  number will require access to a psychiatric team. An even smaller number &mdash;  fewer than 100 a year &mdash; will need access to inpatient care.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The element of the Bamford review that dealt with adult  mental health services and that was published in 2005 recommended that:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;A regional specialist mental health service should be  established for women with mental health problems occurring in the perinatal  period. The requirement for inpatient mother and baby facilities should be the  subject of a regional needs assessment.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In 2008, my Department endorsed the NICE guidance on  antenatal and post-natal mental health. The guidance identified key areas for action,  including: promotion, prediction and detection of mental health issues during  pregnancy and the post-natal period; prevention of mental disorders; management  and use of medication; effective communication; and specialised services for  women with severe perinatal illness. It was recognised that the guidelines  would have significant funding implications for services and that some  recommendations would not be available immediately.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Following the publication of that NICE guidance, my  Department asked the four former health and social services boards to develop  an action plan to implement it. That plan was submitted last year. It was  compre&shy;hensive, and it included recommendations for establishing a specialist  team in each trust area, as well as a four- to six-bed mother-and-baby unit. It  was estimated that implementing the recommendations would cost around &pound;1&middot;2  million a year, plus an estimated &pound;3 million capital cost to build a regional  unit.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">After careful consideration, my officials and professional  advisers concluded that the proposals and actions had merit. However, given  that my resources are stretched to the limit, implementing the recommendations  is just not affordable at this time. Although I may not have the necessary  funding, I am still committed to improving perinatal mental health services in Northern Ireland.  I believe that the best way forward is to adopt a regional stepped approach  that builds on existing work and that links with other major policy areas,  including family support, psychological and psychiatric interventions and child  health promotion.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I emphasise, therefore, that although we do not have  specialist perinatal mental health services in Northern Ireland, a range of  services is always in place for women who need help. The child health promotion  programme, for example, is provided from pregnancy to all women and their  families, irrespective of need or where families live. It guarantees a  universal provision of contacts with key health professionals for every family.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Through the programme, staff members such as health  visitors play a vital role. They can use their contacts with families to access  the health of children and parents, and they can identify other problems, such  as those relating to maternal mental health.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Where problems exist, health visitors provide early support  to mothers. That often prevents problems from escalating. The majority of women  with established mental health problems will be treated in primary care by GPs  or by community mental health teams where appropriate.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have made substantial investment in those areas over the  past few years, in line with the Bamford recommendations. That has resulted in  a range of initiatives, including guidance for health professionals on risk  assessment in adult mental health services, which is aimed at heightening  awareness of the need for timely and appropriate referral; and Beating the  Blues, a computerised therapy for mild to moderate depression accessible  through GPs. That programme will be rolled out to every GP practice this year.  It also supports the additional services for treating depression that the  majority of our GPs are delivering.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Think Child, Think Parent, Think Family project is  about better communication and liaison between children&rsquo;s services and adult  mental health services. There is also the mild to moderate depression scheme,  which encourages health professionals to provide non-drug therapies and employ  counsellors to help treat people with mild to moderate depression.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I recognise that more needs to be done, and will continue  to promote a regional approach to perinatal mental health services as an  important issue. In doing so, my key objective is to develop an integrated care  pathway &mdash; in other words, to create a system whereby all health professionals,  such as GPs, midwives, obstetricians, psychiatrists, and health visitors,  recognise their responsibilities from early pregnancy and in the first year  after birth, and take the appropriate action.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A particular aspect of that integration is the effective  liaison between psychiatric and maternity services, especially for women who  are at risk of a severe perinatal mental health condition. Following further  discussions with colleagues on the board and the Public Health Agency, my  Department has written to those bodies with proposals to take that forward, including  the development of an integrated care pathway, which includes the prediction  and detection of perinatal mental health problems. It will also ensure  appropriate referral and support, to include liaison arrangements between  maternity and psychiatric services.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Additional training programmes will build on the work  already being developed to raise awareness of the need for early detection,  support and timely referral to psychiatric services where appropriate. That needs  to be delivered on a regional basis, focusing on nurses, midwives and health  visitors in the first instance, because they are in regular contact with  pregnant women and their babies.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">An audit of the prevalence of perinatal mental health  conditions will include particular regard to the needs of women with severe  mental health conditions who require inpatient care, and the associated impact  on their families. That audit will inform the way forward in the continued  development of appropriate, specialist services if resources become available.  As I have said, the implementation of a comprehensive perinatal mental health  service would require additional resources that I do not have.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mental health services have suffered from years of neglect  and underfunding. That is why I secured an additional &pound;54 million in the  comprehensive spending review period for those services, on top of the annual  spend of approximately &pound;200 million. However, that is not enough. As I said at  the time of the Budget, it is as good as it gets, but it is not enough. As I  explained during Question Time today, we have had a number of limiting factors  on the health budget, including swine flu and the cuts proposed by the  Executive. There is a gap of &pound;600 million, and I am required to find &pound;700  million in efficiencies. Sinn F&eacute;in proposed that I find that money in a motion  tabled last year, and there was support from other parties to ensure that the  Department of Health had its share of cuts.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The background is that there is rising demand in the Heath  Service &mdash; 9% this year &mdash; against a resource increase of less than 1%. It does  not take a mathematician to work out where we are going.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Our level of activity is dictated by the level of available  resources. Last year, the budget was increased by &pound;12 million. I attempted to  explain all that at a Committee meeting a couple of weeks ago.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">5.30 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There has been interdepartmental sign up to the Bamford  review, and the action plan has finally been received. A fact that is  continually overlooked is that the Department of Health, Social Services and  Public Safety does not have sole responsibility for implementing the Bamford  review. NICE provides guidance on the specialist area of perinatal mental  health, and I have an action plan ready for when I receive the necessary  resources to move forward.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In the meantime, we have a comprehensive mental health  service. Two new hospitals will open in south Belfast soon: the adolescent unit and the  family unit, which will be available to mothers and children. The Bluestone unit  at Craigavon Area Hospital,  for example, also has the capacity to provide a mother-and-baby unit. I fought  successfully to secure investment in mental health, but that investment is now  in jeopardy. We are trying to provide a service and to meet an ever-increasing  demand on a budget that is being continually constrained.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As I explained to Mrs McGill at Committee, there is enough  money in the block grant to provide the requested services. It is a question of  whether the Executive and Members of the Assembly are prepared to apportion  that block grant in an appropriate manner. Over and over again, I have made the  point that health is under&shy;funded and requires more money. If I had the money,  I would be delighted to put those services in place.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Similarly, I would be delighted to put in place a new  children&rsquo;s hospital, a new maternity hospital at the Royal, and much more  besides. Even with the support of Tom Buchanan and some extra money, there is  another proposal to increase services in Omagh. I never thought that I would  hear anyone using a debate on an issue such as perinatal psychiatric services  to electioneer. However, Tom Buchanan&rsquo;s comments never cease to surprise me.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We are where we are, with a good service that could be  improved by a adding a specialist service. I ask Members to recognise that the  implementation of that specialist service will require extra investment.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. It gives me great pleasure to make  a winding-up speech on the debate. I thank all Members who took part and  supported the motion. I want to give special mention to Research and Library  Services for providing an extremely comprehensive research pack. In particular,  I thank Dr Janice Thompson, who enabled the Committee to make comparisons with England, Scotland  and Wales.  It is always useful to make comparisons with our nearest neighbours.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to take the opportunity to welcome the Minister to a  debate. He will probably want a gold star for finding the time to attend  today&rsquo;s debate, but he received a demerit for his non-attendance at last  Tuesday&rsquo;s debate on cancer treatment.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: On a point of order, Mr Deputy  Speaker. I have attended every single health debate. Last week, I informed the  Speaker&rsquo;s Office that I would not be available on a particular day, and the  debate was called for that day. Furthermore, the debate concerned a social  security issue, and no Minister was named until the last minute. For such snide  remarks to be made in a discussion on an important issue &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. Minister, that is not a point of order, but your remarks  are now on the record.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  It was not a point of order, but I am glad that the Minister made the point.  Between 27 April 2009 and 2 February 2010, the Minister attended 20 of 51  health debates in the Chamber. I welcome him to today&rsquo;s debate, but the lack of  ministerial attendance on Tuesdays is an issue.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I also thank the Royal College of Midwives (RCM) for  providing the Committee with a briefing paper in preparation for today&rsquo;s  debate. In common with others, the Royal College of Midwives supports the  implementation of specialist services for perinatal mental health.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As many Members have said, over the years, research has  found that suicide is a leading cause of maternal death. Statistics were cited  by most Members who spoke. However, let me read this into the record: 10% to  15% of women suffer post-natal depression. One in six women will experience  some sort of mental distress during pregnancy or following childbirth.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister cited recent research. There were over 25,000  deliveries in 2008. The rates of the incidence of perinatal mental health imply  that between 2,500 and 4,000 of those new mothers suffered post-natal depression,  and around 51 were admitted to hospital due to a relapse into a pre-existing  mental health problem.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I did some research before Christmas for a women&rsquo;s  community group of which I am a member. On the day that I did that research,  the World Health Organization put out a statement to the effect that an impact  could be made on the cause of women&rsquo;s illnesses, including death, only for the  fact that men are in charge. Coming from the World Health Organization, that is  something that we need to take on board. Look at the rates of ovarian and  cervical cancer: the World Health Organization says that that is because men  are in charge.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bamford report told us a number of things, and specifically  that childbirth is a time of great vulnerability. Conall McDevitt mentioned  that birth moves the focus to the baby. Sometimes the mother is forgotten  about, which can give rise to a situation where a woman can become severely  mentally ill.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I commend the Minister and his Department for getting the  additional money, which is useful. Claire McGill mentioned the Minister&rsquo;s press  release in which he said that he had enough money to deal with the problem. It  is also useful to point out that the June 2009 review of health visiting and  school nursing takes forward another of Bamford&rsquo;s recommendations, and that is  to be welcomed. It is a positive way forward, recognising that early  intervention on infant mental health should be pursued as a preventative measure.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Michelle O&rsquo;Neill, opening the debate, said that perinatal  mental health covers the period from conception to 2 years. We must be careful  that we do not add more troubles and issues if we deal with the issue solely  from the perspective of infant mental health.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mental illness is also a factor in maternal morbidity. I  know of two women in my constituency who have died in recent years as a result  of suicide associated with perinatal mental illness. There is a human aspect to  this: we lose not only an individual member of the community, but a new mother.  Some child is losing his mammy. A family is losing a wife, a partner, a sister  or a daughter. That is the human cost.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We need to look at this issue. I take on board the  Minister&rsquo;s point that we need to live in the real world. I know that the  Minister has hard decisions to take. In her opening remarks, Michelle O&rsquo;Neill  mentioned the North/South Ministerial Council. There are no services for  perinatal mental health across the island   of Ireland. At Question  Time, the Minister said that he had no difficulty in looking to the North/South  dimension if there is a need for it. I suggest that he look at it for this  issue.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Alex Easton said that the focus is sometimes on the baby  rather than the mother, and that is a valid point. Supporting the motion,  Conall McDevitt stressed that there is a lack of joined-up thinking. He went on  to say that the SDLP supports the motion. I am glad that he said that, because  Dolores Kelly, in the previous debate, criticised motions brought before the  Assembly.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That brings me to Sam Gardiner. I do not think that the  motion is a wish list, Sam. I do not accept that my party, or any other, should  not bring issues to the Assembly. We are here as elected activists, so we are  entitled to bring issues to the Assembly, to have them thrashed out and  debated, and to try to take them forward.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As to the Budget, I saw your that party leader was in  earlier to talk to you &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member please direct all remarks through the Chair, rather  than to Members?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  That is not a problem. People are getting very sensitive.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I do not know whether the Member was a member of the Health  Committee at the time, but I proposed that the health budget be equality  proofed, and it was pushed through with all-party support. However, the Member  needs to talk to his party leader to discover what his position was when the  matter went to the Executive.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I return to the briefing from the RCM, which states that  there are significant gaps and that there is a need for regional guidance based  on the NICE guidance. I do not think that that will cost much money. It also  says that there is a need for a multi-professional and inter-professional  training. I do not think that that will cost a lot of money. It says that the  needs of women should be determined in relation to establishing perinatal  mental health services and planning future health strategies. I do not think  that that will cost a lot of money. We can send out a clear message that we may  not get to the endgame this year or next year, but let us start building the  foundations so that at least people can see that we are trying to get there. It  is not always about money.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We need to treat patients, and treating them early saves  money. It is called Investing for Health, which is a strategy to which all  Ministers signed up, with the Health Minister taking the lead. Let us see that  as investing for health.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Other Members, mainly from the Ulster Unionist Party,  mentioned the budget. Claire McGill made a valid point when she highlighted  that the Minister had said in his statement that he had secured additional  money, and thought that he had the money in his budget to deal with the issue.  We need to get it right. The Minister cannot say that there is not enough money  to deal with this issue one minute and then release a press statement that says  that there is enough.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister went on to say that he supports the 2008  guidelines. I would be grateful for an update on the action plan for the four  boards, including outpatient services in trust areas? I also ask the Minister  whether he has made any bids to DFP through the monitoring rounds to take  forward the action plan that came from the trusts. We could then see the  impact, because that is what the Committee has been calling for. The Committee  has been asking the Minister to tell it what impact the recent DFP statement  will have and to let the Committee know how it can help. By saying that he will  not do something, the Minister is not giving the Committee the human side of  the possible impact, which is what the Committee should be told.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We can talk about efficiency savings and wastage in the  Health Service. However, has the Minister had any recent discussions with his  officials about senior staff pay, rather than let the negotiations take place  in England?  If we want devolution, it is about having all the issues relating to health and  other services devolved.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I commend the Members who took part in the debate. It is  useful that we discussed the issues. I commend the Department and the Minister  for taking forward the strategy concerning children who are two years old and  over. However, if we want to get this right, we need to ensure that we go in at  an early stage and build the foundations on concrete rather than sand. We must  remember that this is a human issue. It affects all of us and all our  constituencies. The fact that the issue only affects women does not mean that  we should ignore it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly recognises that the provision of perinatal  psychiatric services is lacking; and calls on the Minister of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety to ensure that mentally ill mothers and their babies  are protected through the establishment of recognised structures for the  provision of mental health care in pregnancy.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Adjourned at 5.43 pm.</p>
