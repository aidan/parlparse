              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am perhaps a little unprepared, as I
              anticipated speaking in an hour and a half. Nevertheless, I
              welcome the opportunity to speak, premature though it is.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The supply and use of energy is one of the
              biggest issues that affects us all. It affects everything from the
              personal cost of living to the costs of major industrialists,
              whether in service or manufacturing industries. It adds a
              considerable amount to the bills and overhead costs of any
              establishment, and, indeed, it adds a considerable amount to the
              Executive’s expenditure because the Civil Service Departments
              probably consume large amounts of energy and, therefore, large
              amounts of money — that energy costs perhaps 25% or 30% more
              than it should.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee for Enterprise, Trade and
              Investment, of which I am a member, spent months working hard on a
              range of energy issues and presented its report to the Assembly
              earlier this year. It was well received and, some weeks ago, Sir
              Reg Empey produced initial proposals for consultation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the preparation of the report, it became
              evident that there is very little stability, cohesion, certainty
              or security in the energy market. It is bitty, scattered and
              disorganised. I hope I am making my points in a non-contentious
              way. The island of Ireland is relatively small in energy terms.
              Indeed, we probably need a much more open energy market in these
              islands, including Scotland, Wales, England and the other regions
              involved. In the short term, I want the various aspects of energy
              to be opened up and joined up on an all-island basis.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I could go into the major debate about gas
              pipelines at length, but it is fairly obvious that gas connections
              are needed, both North/South and east-west with Scotland and
              England. Gas is opening up, and the electricity market needs to be
              opened up very quickly too.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not intend to go into the details of the
              generator contracts, which the House has debated at length before
              and which were also considered in the energy report. I know that
              the generators’ contracts<i> —</i> <i>[Interruption].</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr McDonnell:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is Mr Weir finished?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We will debate at length whether we should buy
              out the generator contracts over the next eight years or leave
              them to fizzle out. Leaving them creates problems, because we must
              ask what will happen after 2010 or 2012. Will we end up with no
              locally generated electricity? Are our stations stable enough to
              produce electricity beyond 2012, or will their owners let them
              chug on inefficiently and switch them off in 2012?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A range of questions must be answered, and
              again I emphasise that they must be examined in an all-island
              perspective. Some people in Fermanagh have discovered that it is
              more efficient and effective to buy their electricity from the
              Electricity Supply Board (ESB) than from NIE. I suggest that the
              Southern Irish electricity market should be opened up and the ESB’s
              monopoly reviewed, but that is a matter for investigation by the
              North/South bodies.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not a question of our taking a daily or
              weekly look at the energy market or, as prices fluctuate, being
              chancers and buying cheap gas or a bit of cheap coal. If we are to
              produce stable energy for the twenty-first century, we must
              produce a 35- to 40-year plan for the direction in which the
              energy debate should go. Generators will not invest, because the
              life of a power station is 35 to 40 years, and no one will invest
              unless the outcome is known.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In a domestic situation, no one will invest in
              an oil-fired boiler if the price of oil is to go through the roof
              in two years’ time. Equally, if coal is to be out of date in
              three years’ time, no one will invest in a solid-fuel boiler.
              Gas is popular, but many people have no access to gas. The
              discussion and perspective must be balanced by what works in rural
              areas without gas and by what works in urban areas where gas is. I
              represent an urban constituency, and all too often matters are
              viewed from an urban perspective. The energy situation is just as
              important in Newtownstewart as it is on the Newtownards Road, and
              the needs of both must be addressed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although I welcome the efforts of the Minister
              of Enterprise, Trade and Investment and his Department over the
              last couple of years to work with the regulator to create some
              kind of stability, we must go further. To some extent, energy can
              be seen as being added on to, or piggy-backed by, a much bigger
              Enterprise, Trade and Investment job-creation agenda. Energy is
              like a motorbike sidecar — it is there when it is needed, but
              most of the time no one pays much attention to it. Primary
              concentration and a stronger group of people who are organised are
              needed to make a real difference in the energy market by finding
              supplies of energy — gas or whatever — and ensuring that those
              supplies are delivered at an affordable price.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am concerned at the scatter of interests
              beyond those vested in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and
              Investment. The Department of Agriculture and Rural Development
              has a major responsibility for renewables. That includes the
              energy potential of biomass from willow and other rapidly grown
              softwoods. It also includes the potential for biogas production,
              whereby pig slurry can be used to produce copious methane gas that
              can then be used efficiently and effectively.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That was an outline of the agricultural issues.
              I could go on at length, but I do not want to delay the House
              unduly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue should interest the Department of the
              Environment because of the potential to create considerable
              amounts of energy from much of the waste that is dumped in
              landfill sites, where it causes other problems. However, from the
              perspective of the man or woman on the street, most of the
              responsibility for energy conservation and fuel poverty, which
              results from houses being badly designed and built, lies with the
              Department for Social Development. The Department of the
              Environment is also responsible to some extent through its
              building control measures.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A plethora of energy issues permeates every
              Department. There are major contentions. The energy inquiry failed
              to resolve the debate on the burning of Orimulsion at Kilroot
              power station. Orimulsion is a tarry substance that can be burnt
              efficiently and effectively and, with the proper controls and
              chimney-washing measures, it is cleaner than either coal or oil.
              That issue must be resolved.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unless energy prices come down by 25% to 30%,
              the local economy will be affected. Our economy is not as
              efficient, effective or welcoming as others are, and in a few
              years’ time, when grants and other incentives are tighter,
              investors will consider criteria such as energy prices. Although
              our well-trained, work-friendly workforce can be promoted in
              Europe and North America, the fact that our energy prices are
              excessive will rapidly counter our efforts.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Would it be worthwhile to buy out the contracts
              now, or would it be worthwhile to take the pain now in order to
              avail of the gain later? We must ensure that in the future we do
              not fall into the trap that the contracts created. Nevertheless,
              the contracts and the regulator must be considered. When the
              contracts expire in 2010, we must ensure that we have not created
              a free-for-all market, because we could be subject to either the
              fluctuations of the market or the power station being switched off
              by the operator if it did not like the price that it was
              receiving.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a long-term need, which must be
              thought out carefully, for the regulation and control of energy.
              Therefore, we must consider how best we can pull together all the
              components and interests that the Assembly has in energy issues.
              Those issues mainly involve the Department of Enterprise, Trade
              and Investment, but the Department of Agriculture and Rural
              Development, the Department of the Environment and the Department
              for Social Development are also involved.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have no great sympathy for quangos, and I am
              not proposing that another quango be created simply for the sake
              of it. However, in this case, it is prudent to consider the
              formation of a twenty-first-century quango with the remit to
              either produce the goods or to be wound up after a set period.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not want to go on too long; I have
              probably talked for long enough. However, I would like to mention
              fuel poverty. I remind Colleagues that the last statistics showed
              that approximately 170,000 of our households — 28% — are in
              fuel poverty. I hope that the number has been reduced a little
              since then.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fuel poverty is when people cannot afford
              enough energy or fuel to keep themselves and their homes warm. It
              is a scandal that, in this day and age, 28% of our population are
              in fuel poverty. Although I have not dwelt on energy conservation
              at length, it is a big part of the equation. We must tackle fuel
              poverty, and, in order to have the teeth necessary to do so, we
              need an energy agency. The agency must cover all aspects of
              energy, from the beginning of the energy production process to its
              ultimate consumption, with the customer switching on an electric
              kettle or other appliance.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is great excitement about gas at the
              moment, and for people in the Belfast region and some other towns
              who can access it, gas seems to be clean, efficient and cheaper
              than oil and other fuel sources. We have been promised large
              supplies of gas from the Corrib gas field off the west of Ireland,
              and that may last for 10 or 15 years. In 20 or 25 years’ time
              we, or those who succeed us in the Chamber, might return to the
              debate, because it may be necessary to procure gas supplies from
              places such as Siberia and pipe it across Europe. That would be a
              major task, and it is why this issue is too big for the present
              structure to handle.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need a dedicated team under the structure of
              a special agency, which would report regularly to the Assembly or
              to the appropriate Ministers, to pull the fragmented energy
              framework together. Such an agency would co-ordinate the existing
              structure and set us up strongly for the future. I urge Members to
              support the motion.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Sinn
              Féin broadly welcomes the objectives of the motion, but with some
              reservations. This debate, and the establishment of an agency,
              might bring about a much-needed examination of our energy
              situation. Major long-term structural problems with energy
              arrangements must be addressed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposed energy agency has merits, since it
              could bring much-needed co-ordination and planning to the
              generation and supply of energy. The motion further proposes that
              conservation — energy efficiency — be included in the agency’s
              remit, and that suggestion is welcome. There are stringent targets
              for the control of energy consumption in the North of Ireland, and
              electricity generation from renewable or sustainable methods has
              been proposed. Such an agency could provide the necessary clout
              and co-ordination to meet our needs. Too often we hear about the
              barriers that people generating electricity from renewable or
              sustainable methods encounter when they attempt to spill their
              extra capacity onto the grid. The proposed agency could streamline
              that process and support electricity production from those means.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has been suggested that the agency’s remit
              would include assessing the energy needs of the Six Counties in
              the medium and longer term, and it could build on the British
              Cabinet Office’s recent energy review. The agency would need to
              examine the expansion of the gas network and the impact that lack
              of access to natural gas might have on the competitiveness and
              economic development of our rural community. It should be further
              tasked with proposing plans to overcome that disadvantage.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Any such agency must also have a pivotal role
              in the development of the all-Ireland energy infrastructure, and
              its remit would need to be expanded to encompass the whole of
              Ireland or any other reciprocal arrangement when the all-Ireland
              infrastructure is established.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I am concerned because the
              Administration does not need another quango. Given that we wish to
              curb public administration, we must think long and hard about the
              financial liability and the implications of such a body. Will the
              public bear the burden of such an agency, and will its
              effectiveness and efficiency make the expenditure worthwhile?</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My final reservation is the most significant.
              There are long-term problems with the energy infrastructure in the
              North of Ireland, as evidenced by high electricity prices and the
              lack of access to natural gas. The proposed role and remit of the
              energy agency may help by tinkering at the edges but will not
              begin to address the fundamental problems of fuel poverty and
              commercial competitiveness, which must be dealt with.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn Féin believes that it is time to explore
              fully all possibilities for solving the problems created by the
              expensive and archaic energy infrastructure that we inherited.
              Westminster has retired from the picture, happy in the knowledge
              that it has reaped millions of pounds from the sale of the North’s
              generation and supply industry. This has resulted in high prices
              for consumers and high profits and dividends for shareholders. It
              is time for a full and open debate on all potential solutions.
              Consumers will pay through their electricity bills for the Moyle
              interconnector with Scotland. However, only the shareholders will
              benefit from the profits of electricity trading on the
              interconnector, which is socially and economically unjust.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An energy agency might help to deal with the
              immediate issues of co-ordinating generation, supply and energy
              efficiency. However, for Sinn Féin to support such an initiative,
              the agency would have to be more than a quango: it would require a
              radical agenda for mapping and planning energy issues throughout
              Ireland for the next 50 years. The proposed agency does not go far
              enough to address the real energy issues in the North of Ireland,
              and Sinn Féin believes that it is time to open the debate fully.

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Neeson:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Dr McDonnell for bringing this matter
              to the attention of the House. Energy is of great interest to me
              and to the Enterprise, Trade and Investment Committee, which
              presented its report to the Assembly on 13 March 2002. The inquiry
              was expected to last a matter of weeks but took almost a year. The
              subject is of great interest to me because 20 years ago one of my
              predecessors appointed me as the Alliance Party spokesperson on
              energy, and I have had the remit ever since.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree in principle with the motion, but we
              must give further consideration to what Dr McDonnell is trying to
              achieve. There is an overlap in the work of the Department of
              Enterprise, Trade and Investment and that of the General Consumer
              Council for Northern Ireland. It is important to clarify what the
              proposed agency’s role would be.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once again, I must express my disgust at the
              Oil Distributors’ Association’s interference. It is trying to
              create obstacles to the extension of the natural gas pipeline to
              the north-west. It is disgraceful that an unregulated sector
              should do that. The price differential across Northern Ireland is
              outrageous, particularly for domestic consumers. If an agency were
              established, it would be important that it examine all aspects of
              energy consumption in Northern Ireland, including petrol. One need
              only look around Northern Ireland to see the major price
              differentials and the unacceptable levels of the importation of
              illegal petrol and diesel. Therefore the remit of the agency
              should be shown in greater detail.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We all want to see a level playing field for
              all consumers in Northern Ireland, and that is why the Committee
              and I have been so keen for as many areas of Northern Ireland as
              possible to benefit from natural gas. The Department will
              introduce its energy Bill soon, and I look forward to that.
              Although I am not speaking as the Deputy Chairperson of the
              Committee, it also looks forward to the publication of the Bill.
              One of the issues to be addressed is the strengthening of the role
              of those with responsibility for consumer affairs. In the
              Committee’s report, which was presented to the Minister and the
              Department, we outlined the need to ensure that there are adequate
              resources to deal with consumer affairs.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, such an agency would have to take the
              European dimension into consideration. When the Committee visited
              Denmark and Brussels last September we became aware of the impact
              of European Directives on the energy market throughout an
              expanding European Union. I agree with Dr McDonnell when he talked
              about the possibility of using natural gas from as far away as
              Siberia. We can look forward to some exciting opportunities in the
              future, and I look forward to the enlargement of the European
              Union, which will provide other major opportunities. In principle,
              I accept the spirit of the motion, and I look forward to the
              Minister’s response.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I declare an interest, as my sister is involved
              in the gas business in the Fermanagh/Sligo area. I have a great
              interest in energy issues, particularly the renewable sector, from
              my work with the Enterprise, Trade and Investment Committee.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will begin by thanking Dr McDonnell for
              bringing the matter to the Floor of the House. The Enterprise,
              Trade and Investment Committee certainly had lengthy debate on the
              issue when compiling its report on energy, but it is valuable to
              keep the issue alive in our minds and in the minds of the public
              and the press. Having said that, I agree with Sean Neeson when he
              said that he agrees with the spirit of the motion. I am slightly
              concerned — and this also applied to a previous motion proposed
              by Dr McDonnell — about any suggestion to set up agencies, given
              the possibility of duplicating work. However, the value of this
              motion is to concentrate minds on the need to do something better.
              I totally agree that there needs to be a streamlining of the
              joined-up government approach to energy issues.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is vitally important, because energy, as
              we have discovered, takes in many different departmental
              responsibilities. These include social, economic and health issues
              ranging from fuel poverty to energy conservation and energy
              efficiency. We desperately need some form of streamlining. I
              wonder whether there is justification for an agency, but some sort
              of team, task force or joined-up government approach would
              certainly be valuable.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must consider the importance of the
              all-Ireland approach — the North/South approach — to energy
              programming. Although the North/South dimension is important, I
              agree with Members that we cannot deal with the issue by having an
              island mentality. There must be an east-west approach, involving
              the British-Irish isles, and a European dimension. That would
              cover not only the examples of best practice we saw during our
              trip to Denmark, when we learnt about the energy market there, but
              also tapping into energy in Europe and countries beyond the former
              Iron Curtain. The global aspect must be included, but it will be
              difficult to achieve that if we have a single unit in Northern
              Ireland. The onus is on the British-Irish Council and the
              North/South Ministerial Council to see this as a priority for work
              in infrastructure.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last, but by no means least, is my bandwagon
              — the renewable energy sector. We are lagging too far behind in
              that area. Nevertheless, good, healthy momentum has been achieved.
              There has been great progress on wind farming. I welcome the plans
              for the wind farm off the north coast, but I wonder about them. I
              would appreciate a progress report outlining what the potential
              delays might be.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is definitely the energy source of the
              future. We must move away from fossil fuels. We do not even have
              to keep up with the demands of European Directives; we can go
              further. Why can we not develop the technology for the new energy
              markets using wind, wave, tides, and biomass? Why can we not use
              our agriculture industry to provide us with renewable energy? This
              is the way forward for our economy. It would allow us to use our
              university research to develop new technologies, and it would be
              good for consumers. We are talking about healthy social and
              economic development — renewable energy is about that.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is the twenty-first century — however,
              we are inclined to forget it, as many people are still deeply
              rooted in the late seventeenth century. Some people are trying to
              solve our political problems using seventeenth century methods
              marked by appalling bigotry, superstition and violence. Despite
              the greatest efforts of our best people — our active visionaries
              — the Enlightenment has passed by too many of our leaders. The
              vision enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement is beyond their
              understanding: so much for Dark Ages politics.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Things become a little better when we look at
              social, economic and technological thought and achievement. As an
              SDLP Back-Bencher, I blush prettily, but modestly, at the
              knowledge that the SDLP is at the forefront of progressive
              political thought and because it has so much to offer in the
              social, cultural and economic fields.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome Dr McDonnell’s initiative. The
              provision of economical, reliable, safe energy is essential for
              economic prosperity and the health and well-being of the entire
              community. It is scandalous that the neediest and the most
              vulnerable have the greatest dependence on the most expensive and
              least healthy fuels. For their sake and that of the economy and
              environment, the generation and supply of energy must be brought
              out of the early twentieth century and into the twenty-first. We
              have the power sources and the technology; all we need is the will
              and a great deal of co-operation from many people and
              organisations. That would include involving those who are
              concerned about protecting and improving the environment. It would
              involve the quickest possible move away from fossil fuels.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We all know about the &quot;polluter pays&quot;
              principle, and most would agree with it. The harsh reality is that
              we pay the polluters to heat and to light our homes and to power
              our factories and vehicles. The cost is not only monetary; we pay
              with our bad health, the desperate pressure on our social services
              and the poorer quality of our lives.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need a body with substantial independence
              from the power producers and providers. That would be the only way
              to emphasise energy production from our plentiful renewable
              resources, which Jane Morrice highlighted. We have endless
              supplies of wind, water, and, unfortunately, waste. I thoroughly
              approve of wind farms. Concerns about their visual impact on the
              environment could be eased through sensitive management.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will devote the rest of my precious time to
              Sandy Bain, whose letter to the ‘Sunday Herald’ in Scotland
              was published on 17 March 2002. Like a good Irish politician, I
              was in Scotland on that day.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The letter reads:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;It is disappointing that so much of the
              debate about Scotland’s energy needs 10 or more years in the
              future is being conducted with reference to 20th century
              technology. The coming pollution-free fuel is hydrogen. … More
              importantly, however, using electricity from renewable sources to
              produce hydrogen will give a much greater degree of flexibility.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Electricity derived from wind, wave and tidal
              power at locations along the northwest coast and in the Western
              Isles should be used to produce hydrogen from sea water. This
              hydrogen would then be transported by sea in gas tankers to the
              existing coastal thermal power stations at Peterhead, Inverkip,
              Cockenzie and Longannet, adapted to use hydrogen as fuel. The
              electricity produced would be distributed to consumers through the
              existing national grid, removing the need to lay an expensive
              subsea cable or despoil our scenic areas with overhead lines. The
              unreliability of renewable sources of electricity will be overcome
              too. Ideally Clyde shipyards would build the gas tankers required
              and Scottish engineering companies would become market leaders in
              building the hydrogen production plants and doing power station
              conversions. Any surplus hydrogen could, of course, be exported
              worldwide.&quot;</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sandy, quite naturally, speaks for Scotland.
              However, our scenario is so similar that what would be good for
              Scotland could be equally good for us, by which I mean everyone on
              this island. That is why I wanted Sandy’s words to be recorded
              in Hansard and to be food for thought when Dr McDonnell’s agency
              is set up, as I hope it will be soon.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Beggs:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the concept of a greater
              co-ordination of energy supply and conservation in Northern
              Ireland to protect our environment and to reduce electricity
              prices for residential and industrial consumers. Northern Ireland
              suffers from some of the highest prices in Europe, and those key
              issues must be addressed so that we can remain competitive,
              continue to protect our environment and respect it more.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is the proposed agency needed or will it simply
              duplicate other projects? Would it try to draw strands together
              and form another layer of bureaucracy in this small part of the
              United Kingdom? That must be considered carefully. Should we
              examine how we could restructure our present system? The
              Department of Agriculture and Rural Development has an interest in
              willow biomass and electricity production through the farming
              industry. Should responsibility for those matters be transferred?
              In addition, the Department for Social Development is interested
              in energy conservation. Should that role be transferred so that
              one area deals with the supply and conservation of electricity?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps the Department for Social Development’s
              role in identifying those suffering from fuel poverty should
              become a key aspect of its work. There may also be scope for the
              issue to be included in the review of public administration. The
              restructuring of Departments is not the issue; subject to
              agreement, some sections of Departments might logically sit
              somewhere else.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have not heard much about how OFREG will fit
              into this plan. Will it become defunct? I value OFREG’s
              independence and believe that its powers should be increased. It
              is disappointing that OFREG has not been as successful as we would
              have liked in driving down electricity prices in Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Improvements are necessary. The electricity
              contracts that were handed out during direct rule were a licence
              to print money, and that was of no benefit to the people of
              Northern Ireland. NIE is moving towards electricity generation
              through the Huntstown power station in the Republic of Ireland.
              The grey area is becoming larger. Is NIE an independent
              distributor or a generator? Does it give greater priority to the
              profits of its shareholders than it does to the interests of the
              people of Northern Ireland? That question must be answered.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">OFREG’s powers should be increased to favour
              the consumer. Considering the initial investment in their shares,
              the private companies have made healthy profits. Increased
              downward pressure on prices should now be applied. There have been
              benefits by way of improvements to the generating equipment, but
              that has been transmitted into their profits.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nationalist Members have emphasised the
              all-island aspect. However, we must fit into the United Kingdom
              structures of electricity production and regulation. The Kyoto
              agreement provided for that, and we must abide by it. There are
              two sides to the coin. There is a United Kingdom and a European
              aspect as well as the all-Ireland aspect. We must ensure that any
              benefits are delivered to the consumer. A sizeable electricity
              interconnector is now on-stream, which is also applying downward
              pressure on electricity prices in Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I consider Dr McDonnell’s proposals to be at
              the early stages. It would be premature to jump now. Further
              consideration is required, and I look forward to hearing what Dr
              McDonnell and the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment
              have to say in reply.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Courtney:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. However, other issues
              must be highlighted. The Committee for Enterprise, Trade and
              Investment’s energy inquiry concluded that if we were ever to
              get an efficient system, it should have as wide a remit as
              possible, possibly on an all-Ireland basis, and it should conform
              to EU Directives.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has been obvious for some time that the
              energy industry needs an all-Ireland remit if it is to have a
              stable future. After the storms in the winter of 1998, when lines
              came down and many people suffered a miserable Christmas and new
              year, the industry invested in greater volume, modern
              installations and upgraded lines. However, the problem remains
              that NIE has a monopoly, with Belfast being the only area that has
              the alternative of British Gas.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr McClelland] in the
              Chair)</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This system has proved effective — it is more
              economical and it provides consumer choice. Renewable energy is
              becoming more effective, but it still falls far short of
              Government proposals. The recent decision to install a
              North/South, east-west gas pipeline throughout Ireland will be a
              real boost for the north-west of Northern Ireland and for Donegal.
              The Oil Promotion Federation has taken the matter to the EU to try
              to prevent that, and that says more about the federation than
              anyone else could. The Oil Promotion Federation is not controlled,
              and it is regulated by providers and consumers. The federation
              calling &quot;foul&quot; brings to mind the pot and the kettle. I
              support the call for a Northern Ireland energy agency to assess,
              plan and actively manage all aspects of energy procurement, supply
              and conservation in Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members supported the report produced by the
              Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment, and I agree that,
              in the short term, a Northern Ireland energy agency would ensure
              that our aims are achieved sooner rather than later, and it would
              provide consumer choice to more people.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice said that she welcomed the fact that
              the motion was keeping the issue alive in our minds and that it
              was allowing us to remain focused on a matter that was important
              to everyone. I entirely agree that the debate achieves that
              objective. I have listened carefully to Dr McDonnell calling for
              the establishment of a Northern Ireland energy agency. However, I
              point out that his proposal goes much further than the Committee
              for Enterprise, Trade and Investment’s recommendation in its
              report on the energy inquiry. It simply said that the agency idea
              should be considered. There is no suggestion in the Committee’s
              report that the wider proposition was seriously examined. However,
              I intend to respond fully to the Committee’s report in the near
              future and to deal with some of those issues.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree, to some extent, with Mr Neeson, Ms
              Morrice and Mr Beggs that the call for an agency is somewhat
              premature. We must remember that the energy sector in Northern
              Ireland is privatised. All the generation is in private hands, as
              is the distribution. However, in the Republic the generation is
              primarily in the control of the state. The Committee visited
              Denmark to look at its model. The Danish Energy Agency is
              responsible for climate change negotiations, oil and gas
              exploration, research programmes and bilateral programmes with
              Eastern European countries. In other words, it is a significant
              body that interfaces with powers far and beyond any that
              devolution would have. It is responsible for oil and gas
              exploration, for example, so it is a very different animal. Many
              Members have referred to the desirability of greater
              co-ordination, and I have no difficulty with that. It is entirely
              common sense that where several Departments have at least some
              degree of interest in a subject they should co-ordinate. However,
              it is impossible to get every subject matter that has a
              cross-departmental activity gathered together in one place.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many issues and themes in Government are
              cross-cutting. I accept what Members have said about fuel poverty.
              However, I recently attended the opening of a scheme in my East
              Belfast constituency. A home had been fitted with gas central
              heating, insulation et cetera under a pilot scheme that the
              Department for Social Development was carrying out in Belfast.
              Insufficient applications had been made to use all the money
              available on the pilot scheme, although it was fantastic to see
              what had been achieved. For example, hundreds of home helps in
              Belfast spend hundreds of man-hours lighting fires for people, yet
              those facilities could be installed cheaply and efficiently, and
              would prove less hassle for someone who is unable to get around
              easily. It is a terrible shame that the scheme is not receiving
              the level of support that we would like. I sympathise with the
              objectives to which Dr McDonnell and other Members referred.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Department recently published a consultation
              paper, ‘Towards a New Energy Market Strategy for Northern
              Ireland’, which recognised the interaction between energy and
              other priorities such as climate change, social inclusion, fuel
              poverty, health and equality. That echoes my previous point that
              many energy issues are cross-cutting. The paper posed the question
              of how an integrated approach to the issue might be secured, and
              we are currently analysing the responses that we received.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I cannot say with absolute conviction that all
              the energy concerns that have come before the Assembly would have
              been solved more easily if an organisation of that kind existed;
              we must remember that we deal with a privatised industry. The
              energy issue is in no way &quot;bolted on&quot; to the Department’s
              activities; I view it as a mainstream part of my work. I was
              surprised in that I underestimated the amount of time and effort
              that that would take, all because the energy sector is a
              privatised industry. I spend much of my time on the issue, as do
              my officials. A division of the Department is dedicated to energy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will be aware that, in the current
              session, I intend to introduce a utilities Bill to deal with a
              range of issues, including the consumer arrangements and the
              situation with regard to the regulator, which Mr Beggs mentioned.
              I accept that a range of issues must be dealt with.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Neeson referred to the European dimension.
              We hope to achieve more market opening, as that is the trend in
              the European Union, and we hope that that will bring down prices.
              It is frustrating that we have been unable to bring proposals to
              the House that will achieve reductions; however, I hope that those
              proposals will emerge in the coming weeks. I do not despair,
              because the situation has been changing for the better in the past
              couple of years. A new combined-cycle power station is under
              construction at Ballylumford. That will introduce state-of-the-art
              generating equipment, which will produce electricity more
              efficiently than the current station does. As the consumer will
              pay fuel costs directly, electricity will be produced more
              efficiently, which will have a downward impact on prices.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A project, which includes the extension of the
              gas pipeline, has been earmarked for Coolkeeragh. However, I share
              the anger of some Members at what has been happening there, and
              the attempts that have been made to frustrate a strategic
              decision. As Dr McDonnell said, Coolkeeragh has had a power
              station for 30 or 40 years and someone is making decisions on the
              basis of what may happen to the plant’s profits in the next six
              or 12 months. We must plan strategically for energy production for
              future generations, given that the infrastructure is so expensive.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the Coolkeeragh power station developments
              take place, they will result in a state-of-the-art, highly
              efficient gas turbine. Mr Beggs referred to the Moyle
              interconnector, which has come on-stream and which will help to
              bring competition into the market in the long term.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The renewable energy sector has potential, but
              there are limitations to the use of renewables in Northern
              Ireland. For example, the geography here does not enable us to
              create meaningful amounts of hydroelectricity. My Department and
              the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development are interested
              in biomass, anaerobic digesters and other new technologies, and we
              will be pursuing those options. However, such technologies have a
              long way to go before they can deliver electricity at commercial
              prices.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Wind energy is one area in which we may have
              made more progress. However, Members must understand that there
              are lessons to be learnt from privatisation when dealing with
              renewables. Although we may be anxious to introduce renewables
              into the mainstream energy system, we must plan carefully and be
              cautious about the cost. There is no point in producing renewable
              energy that is so expensive that no one can buy it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Apart from wind energy, the renewable energy
              technologies have a long way to go. My Department will wish to
              discuss those matters further with the Committee for Enterprise,
              Trade and Investment as we move towards introducing policies
              concerning renewables.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Jane Morrice and Arthur Doherty mentioned
              offshore wind farms. That method of energy production has
              potential and, as Members may know, my Department, in conjunction
              with the Department of Public Enterprise in the Republic, prepared
              a report on the options for wind energy production, particularly
              offshore production, around the island. The Tunes Plateau site,
              situated off the north coast of Northern Ireland, emerged as a
              strong possibility. Discussions between the Crown Estate and a
              possible applicant are at a delicate stage, and I cannot predict
              the outcome. If the project were to proceed, a substantial period
              of public consultation on the environmental impact would be
              required. I am not in a position to say whether it will proceed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the fact that energy management is
              being kept on the agenda, because it is an area of activity that
              has been neglected. Reference was made to the unfortunate
              contracts that were entered into several years ago. Those
              contracts have now run for over half of their allotted time, and
              we have spent much time examining the matter.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept the spirit of the motion, but I am not
              convinced that setting up another quango would add to the sum of
              knowledge on the issue. I am not trying to pour cold water on the
              motion, because I fully understand the Member’s concerns. The
              spirit of the motion is going in the right direction, and I accept
              that there needs to be a joined-up approach. However, bearing in
              mind that we are dealing with the private sector, I am concerned
              that another body might not achieve better results than those that
              can be achieved by adapting existing systems and ensuring that
              there is the sort of cross-departmental activity that already
              exists in other areas. I want to discuss the matter further with
              the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment, and I hope to
              be able to say something on this when making a formal response to
              the Committee’s valuable report.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Action has already been taken on the matter
              that Mr Beggs raised about different Departments having bits and
              pieces of interest across the subject. For example, the Department
              for Social Development deals with fuel poverty, the Department of
              Enterprise, Trade and Investment has interests in wider energy
              issues and the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development
              also has energy-related interests. Following devolution, the
              Department for Regional Development was considered to have a
              strategic energy role. In fact, that Department did not have the
              statutory basis or the staff for such. It was a kind of anomaly.
              The proposal is to draft an Order to incorporate responsibility
              for energy again in my Department. Functions have already been
              moved around, and that may happen again. From time to time it may
              be that functions will not be in the right place and will have to
              be moved around.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to linkages, while energy is being
              considered in an all-Ireland context, my Department is considering
              it in a European context. The island of Ireland is a tiny energy
              market in international terms. Over the years, Northern Ireland’s
              problem has been isolation from major sources of supply. The
              Department’s objective is to ensure that we do not remain
              isolated. That is why I am pleased that we now have gas and
              electricity interconnection with Great Britain, which will
              progress to a European connection. That will ensure that we have
              supply reinforcement and do not depend on one source. That was the
              rock on which we perished in the 1970s when we were entirely
              dependent on oil. That was ruinous, and I warmly welcome the
              opening-up of sources of supply. That is the best way to bring
              prices down in the long term, once contracts are dealt with.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the debate and appreciate the
              interest and concern of Members, which I share. I assure them, and
              particularly Dr McDonnell, that I do not regard the Department’s
              responsibility for energy as a sidecar on a bike. I regard it to
              be mainstream, and officials will confirm that because they put
              much time and effort into energy. It is important. I also hope
              that if the Assembly brings the Bill forward during this session,
              it will address the range of significant matters that concern
              Members, particularly on the consumer side, about who operates the
              system — the transmissions operator — and buying and selling.
              All of those matters must be considered.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will respond in detail to the Committee for
              Enterprise, Trade and Investment. However, I cannot yet support
              the Member’s proposal for another body. The Assembly must wait
              and see and discuss further with the Committee for Enterprise,
              Trade and Investment to decide whether the draft legislation will
              achieve its objectives. We should not yet proceed to create
              another agency.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand the merits of what the Member has
              said and the need for a co-ordinated, strategic long-term view.
              However, I am not convinced that another non-departmental public
              body attached to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and
              Investment would achieve our shared objectives. I ask the Member
              to address that point in his summing-up.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the Assembly votes on the motion it should
              consider the Cabinet Office’s major energy review, which was
              published in February 2002 and which was mentioned by Mr Conor
              Murphy. The review considered new institutional arrangements for
              energy policy-making and delivery. A cross-departmental unit is
              being created in the Department of Trade and Industry in London
              with its future position subject to review depending on the roles
              of climate change, energy policy and transport policy within the
              Government. That document did not consider removing those critical
              issues from direct departmental and ministerial responsibility and
              putting them into an agency. However, we will watch that
              development closely because there may be lessons to be learned.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am satisfied that the structures of our
              devolved Administration are capable of ensuring that the Executive’s
              policies are effectively and jointly established and managed
              without necessarily having a major reorganisation of the type
              proposed in the motion. The present arrangements ensure clarity of
              responsibility and accountability and avoid unnecessary cost and
              disruption. Therefore, while it is not appropriate to support the
              motion now, I accept the spirit in which it was moved. I also
              accept without any hesitation the sentiments that many Members
              expressed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As we progress this year, we will collectively
              be able to make progress in the energy field. As has been pointed
              out, energy is vital to our competitiveness because the higher the
              cost, the harder it is to be competitive. That, of course, ties in
              with debates on rating policy, local government financing and
              other issues. I am keener than anybody to ensure that we get over
              the hump of high energy costs because they are a direct challenge
              to our competitiveness and affect jobs.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr McDonnell:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I repeat my thanks to every Member who spoke.
              The debate was useful, although it came earlier than expected and
              was perhaps a little surprise to some. However, we got it together
              reasonably well, and most issues were aired. I am indebted to
              Members who took the time to collect their thoughts, to prepare
              speeches and to contribute to the debate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The purpose of tabling the motion was to keep
              the energy issue alive — it is a big issue that is never quite
              top of the agenda. It is third or fourth on the agenda, and it
              should be higher. Most Members welcomed the principle and thrust
              of the motion, which was to do exactly that and create some form
              of joined-up strategy. It is fairly clear that, from whatever
              corner of the Chamber, we agree that we must find a more effective
              mechanism to deal with energy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s comments about
              legislation that may be coming forward. However, we need some sort
              of a driver. That was my concern when I tabled the motion. I have
              seen the good work of the Department and OFREG, and I have the
              highest regard for the regulator and the many consumer and
              pressure groups that have been working to combat fuel poverty.
              However, someone must drive the policy forward because, mostly, it
              just reacts to a difficulty or shortfall.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must also make progress on energy
              procurement, which may be a major issue in the long term, and
              conservation. Much of that concerns the Department of the
              Environment, given its responsibility for building control and the
              quality of buildings.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report is an excellent document, but it is
              only fair to say that the issues are so vast and so greatly in
              need of debate that a permanent committee could have dealt with
              the subject of energy alone. That is not to do the report any
              disservice. We had to draw a line somewhere, and, unfortunately,
              we could not go into every detail. This debate supplements the
              report. If the Minister does not get the recommendations right, we
              will come back, and perhaps keep coming back, to the issue. That
              is a compliment to the Minister, rather than a threat.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to thank specific Members. Conor Murphy
              welcomed the report and made a very good contribution. I agree
              with all his points. There may be a major need to deal with
              structural and conservation problems. I was not particularly
              confining myself, as he seemed to suggest, to Northern Ireland or
              the Six Counties. I see a very strong all-Ireland dimension in
              this, just as there is a very strong British dimension. It is not
              a political all-Ireland dimension; it is purely a business
              dimension to ensure survival. Overriding all that is the European
              dimension, both in legislation and in long-term supply. If we
              adopt gas, we shall be able to obtain it from the Corrib field in
              the west of Ireland for perhaps 10 to 15 years. After that, we
              shall have to explore eastern Europe, into Russia and perhaps
              beyond.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Conor Murphy made a point about this being
              another quango. We should get rid of most quangos. However, there
              are some good ones, so we should not throw the baby out with the
              bathwater. We should not be averse to creating a quango for
              tomorrow if a scattered issue such as energy needs a focus and a
              driver. I return to the concept of drivers because the scatter
              creates a situation in which we react to emergencies and crises
              rather than taking a proactive, long-term view.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Sean Neeson for mentioning overlaps and
              for clarifying who does what. That returns to the driver
              principle. I am sure that we all agree with what he said about the
              oil companies, about strengthening the role of those responsible
              for consumer affairs and about the European dimension.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Jane Morrice agreed with the spirit of the
              motion and emphasised the need to avoid duplication. I do not want
              to see any duplication.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Roy Beggs supported the principle of the
              motion, but expressed some worry about the agency’s functions.
              The agency’s functions concern a proactive and aggressive view
              of the energy situation. I do not suggest duplication, but a much
              harder and clearer focus on the future is necessary. Mr Beggs
              queried the all-Ireland aspect. There is such an aspect, and the
              Minister articulated that much better than I could have done.
              However, there is also an east-west aspect, with the European
              dimension overlying it all.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister mentioned that most energy is
              privatised, and that those private companies are fairly shrewd and
              capable of finding ways around regulations. An aggressive
              organisation is needed to confront them.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have the highest regard for the regulator.
              However, he would be the first to admit that his difficulty is
              that both the legislation and his authority are limited. In many
              cases he reacts like the rest of us do to a crisis or difficulty.
              He has no responsibility for the long-term supply of energy; he
              can deal only with the day-to-day situation and attempt to ensure
              that tomorrow will be a little better than today, and that prices
              will be kept under control.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Arthur Doherty spoke of mobilising goodwill and
              of moving away from fossil fuels. He also mentioned the health
              issue. Some interesting comments on hydrogen have come from
              Scotland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Annie Courtney talked of the gas industry in
              general and of the gas pipeline for the north-west. That is vital.
              It does not concern getting gas only to Coolkeeragh, but to every
              town along the route where it would not otherwise be economical to
              do so.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for his kind comments. He
              may be correct to suggest that the call for the agency is
              premature, but will it be premature in six months or in a year?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I dealt with the question of energy in private
              hands. That is not a bad thing, if we take an aggressive approach
              and are equal to a situation in which those private hands perhaps
              play games or milk the system.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those members of the Committee for Enterprise,
              Trade and Investment who visited Denmark were impressed. When the
              Minister spoke of the Danes, the powers and authorities, I was not
              sure whether he advocated the setting up of a new department of
              energy, not simply an agency. The Danes’ approach is aggressive.
              They have taken energy seriously, and that has stood them in good
              stead. Their energy costs have been considerably reduced and there
              have been environmental benefits.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister mentioned the fuel poverty
              implications of renewable energy. The point that I made about the
              all-Ireland dimension is summed up by the fact that Northern
              Ireland was isolated previously. Even now, the few electricity
              interconnectors with the South, and the one with Scotland, are
              relatively trivial. We need a second interconnector with Scotland,
              because it is impossible to have an energy market without a
              supply. Our problem is that all of the energy supply going through
              the interconnector with Scotland is committed, and that given that
              the take up of energy in the South is so high, it does not have
              surplus to send through the cross-border interconnectors. The
              Minister is frowning. Is my statement incorrect?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The infrastructure is in place to facilitate a
              substantial amount of trading through the interconnector with the
              Republic. However, the distribution network on the Southern side
              is not sufficiently robust, and for technical reasons it can only
              operate at full capacity for short periods of time. Therefore, for
              most of the time, it operates at substantially less than half of
              its capacity.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When I attended the recent opening of the
              interconnector with Mary O’Rourke TD, electricity was being
              imported to Northern Ireland: given the good weather then, our
              local power stations decided to close some sets for maintenance.
              Therefore, current was being sucked through the interconnector to
              Northern Ireland. However, because of demand, current is exported
              most of the time. The big advantage is that the process reduces
              spinning reserve, which is generating capacity that is spinning
              but not supplying current. It is there in case a breakdown occurs,
              and that, coupled with the ability to trade nation-to-nation
              through the interconnectors with Scotland and the South, is the
              key advantage. There are technical reasons for the interconnector
              not working to full capacity, and work is continuing to improve it
              so that it becomes more efficient.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A high percentage of the electricity from the
              interconnector is traded on the open market — only about 125
              megawatts are contracted.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr McDonnell:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I stand corrected. My brief visits to power
              stations have convinced me that it is difficult to be an expert on
              such highly technical matters.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When I proposed the motion, I felt that we
              needed to create the stability, consistency and confidence in our
              energy markets that have been lacking. Energy markets have been
              unstable and, perhaps, that was emphasised most in the 1970s, when
              we were heavily dependent on oil. Many people who depend on oil
              are uneasy about the potential for shenanigans in Iraq that would
              send oil prices through the roof.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must ensure that energy is supplied at a
              reasonable price and that people can access it fairly. People who
              live close to the border may access electricity easily from the
              Electricity Supply Board (ESB) across the border, but we must
              ensure that people who live in rural areas such as Belleek or
              Killeter are not compounded further into fuel poverty or energy
              poverty. I strongly endorse the message that there should be no
              duplication.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am very interested in renewable sources of
              energy. Wind power could supply 25% to 30% of our electricity
              requirement. Wave power is interesting, and I appeal to the
              Minister to consider seriously the mouth of Strangford Lough. I
              have been told that if we could persuade other interested parties
              to co-operate, which might be a bigger task than first thought,
              the mouth of Strangford Lough could produce up to 30% of our
              energy requirements.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am aware of the strong tide in Strangford
              Lough. Although the construction of a tidal barrage is a valuable
              option, many people have serious concerns about the environmental
              impact on that part of the lough.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That exemplifies how contentious and serious
              the issues are. I sympathise with those who have an environmental
              interest in Strangford Lough, but in a couple of years we will
              have to choose between a view across the lough but higher
              electricity prices, and a perhaps less exciting environment but
              cheaper electricity.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An energy agency could oversee the introduction
              of combined heat and power. I am told that Kilroot power station
              — and Mr Neeson would know more about that than I — could
              provide Carrickfergus with free hot water and central heating.
              However, where is the connectivity between the power station and
              the consumer? The Department for Social Development would not
              oversee the scheme; an agency is needed to glue the pieces
              together. Great work is being done, but the bodies that are

              its energy to generate electricity. The remaining two thirds are
              released into the air or, as unused hot water, into the sea. The

              comments about the interconnectors are welcome, that is only a
              first step. There is not enough choice, and there are big gaps —
              for example, the failure to develop the combined heat and power
              mechanism at Kilroot. Such matters must be acted upon, but I am
              unsure whether responsibility lies with the Department for Social
              Development, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment,
              or another body. I tabled the motion to try to clear the
              bottlenecks for which nobody seems to be responsible.</p>

              The Council had agreed that the independent consultative forum, as

              be based on formal interaction between the structures that
              represent civil society in Northern Ireland and in the South. We

              established between the structures that represent civil society in
              Northern Ireland and in the Republic of Ireland. The official
              working group put forward that proposal and is considering
              recommendations that it hopes to bring forward at the next plenary
              meeting. The consultation process is focusing on the terms of
              reference, the composition of the consultative forum, its initial
              work programme, how it would be chaired and where and when it
              would meet.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Civic Forum in Northern Ireland has already
              submitted some initial views on several of those matters. The
              official working group is considering those and expects to receive
              views from the Republic of Ireland shortly. The establishment of
              the consultative forum is proceeding. I do not wish to use the
              word &quot;delay&quot;, but the outstanding matter is the receipt
              of the views of the civic partners in the Republic of Ireland.</p>

              light be shed on the cancellation of a regional strategy for
              social inclusion that was to have been launched tomorrow? Was the
              cancellation due to the fact that the Civic Forum has been unable
              to agree on the matters that were to have been launched? What was
              the cost to the Exchequer of the cancellation?</p>

              would acknowledge that the Civic Forum is remarkably cheap and
              represents good value for the people of Northern Ireland. It
              provides a mechanism for aspects of society that are not
              represented in the Assembly to have a consultative input to
              socio-economic issues. I know that in the fantasies of some
              Members in that corner of the Chamber, the Civic Forum is some
              sort of puppet operated by the Office of the First Minister and
              the Deputy First Minister. I can assure the Member that that is
              not the case. I cannot answer his questions in detail because the
              Civic Forum — and not the Office of the First Minister and the

              wait. It is hoped that we will soon be able to launch the review
              of public administration, which will be looking at administrative
              structures rather than at the Civic Forum. Therefore I do not see
              that there is any necessary interaction between the review of
              public administration and the continued operation of the Civic
              Forum.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Civic Forum will be under review — that
              is provided for and is understood. We are consulting the Civic
              Forum about the nature of the review, and I see no reason why the
              two exercises cannot proceed on their own terms. The question is
              what will come out of those exercises, and the review of the Civic
              Forum in particular. I do not wish to express any view about the
              review of the Civic Forum, as that might lead some persons to
              think there is some sort of prefiguring of it. We should await the

              international attention and goodwill. Now, as we step forward, we
              should be trying to find ways to help others — not only regions
              like ourselves that are stepping forward from conflict, but also
              parts of the world that suffer from long-standing
              underdevelopment. The ways to do so are not immediately available
              to us as a devolved region with no formal powers in this matter.
              However, we can show some lateral thinking. That has already
              happened in the Assembly in relation to fair trade, and the
              Assembly has already passed resolutions on the debt issue.</p>

              world are rolling up to heaven as we yet again create problems for
              ourselves and try to trap ourselves in the past when we should be

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with the thrust of the Member’s
              question. All the people of the island can benefit from
              North/South co-operation where that is for mutual benefit and the
              advancement of common issues. That is particularly appropriate in
              the context of the EU. All the people of this island can also
              benefit from wider EU co-operation. I wonder whether the thrust of
              the Member’s question means that he and his Colleagues are now
              more favourably disposed towards co-operation at a European level
              as well as at an all-Ireland level?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We can use the North/South Ministerial Council
              to improve co-operation in sectoral matters. We also must improve
              our approach to issues of common concern that arise at an EU
              policy level. That is why we have undertaken the work outlined in
              my original answer.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The benefits of money allocated to community
              relations are appraised in three main ways: by attitudinal
              surveys; by research projects; and by independent evaluations of
              funded groups. The bulk of community relations funding goes to the
              Community Relations Council and to support district council
              community relations programmes. That funding amounts to some
              £4·5 million of the total allocation of just over £5 million.
              Both the Community Relations Council and the district council
              community relations programmes have been subject to independent
              evaluation in the past 18 months. In both cases, positive
              conclusions were reached with regard to the impact of their

              well over £100 million on community relations. All the evidence
              on the streets shows that community relations are worse. Will the
              Deputy First Minister confirm that the OFMDFM-commissioned report
              by Dr Peter Shirlow also expressed that view? Is that why the

              correct Members because of their confusion over two different
              reports. Dr Shirlow carried out work commissioned by the Belfast
              European Partnership Board. However, a separate piece of work,
              relating to other areas and times, was commissioned by OFMDFM. I

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A significant amount of money has been spent on
              community relations, and a significant amount of work remains to
              be done. It is a huge problem, and nobody is pretending that all
              the problems are behind us. We must be cautious about making
              sweeping judgements that community relations are worse, based on

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The regional development strategy for Northern
              Ireland, which was agreed by the Assembly, identifies Ballyclare
              as one of the seven towns that will expand to meet the housing
              need in the Belfast metropolitan area. However, the strategy also
              recognises that it will be necessary to require developers to bear
              the costs of infrastructure works required to facilitate their
              development proposals, and that the promotion of transportation
              alternatives to the private car will also play a major role.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As regards current and future transport needs,
              my Department is developing the Belfast metropolitan transport
              plan, which I hope will be completed by the end of this financial
              year. It will inform the Belfast metropolitan area plan, which is
              being developed by the Planning Service. The transport plan will
              provide a long-term vision for transport in the Belfast
              metropolitan area, including the Ballyclare area, and it will
              co-ordinate the implementation of transportation initiatives until
              2015.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The lines of two major road schemes in
              Ballyclare have been protected under the current area plan, which
              also identifies housing and industrial development in the town.
              The first scheme is a proposed link road between the Ballynure to
              Templepatrick road and the Ballyclare to Doagh road, with the
              purpose of easing congestion at the lower end of Main Street. The
              second proposed scheme, which will probably be led by developers,
              will link Doagh Road to Rashee Road. The schemes will be reviewed
              by the Belfast metropolitan transport plan, but if either is
              needed to support a development, the developer may have to
              contribute to it, in full or in part, depending on the outcome of
              the transport assessment.</p>

              should advise the Planning Service to ban housebuilding in the

              significant land was zoned for development, but the necessary
              infrastructure was not provided until after the houses were built.
              Timing is an issue; however, if a development results in
              additional traffic or requires additional water infrastructure,
              the developer should provide the necessary infrastructure.</p>

              broken parking meters remain out of operation for a long time, and
              revenue to the Northern Ireland block is lost. The scheme uses SIM
              (subscriber identity module) card technology — as do the mobile
              phones that are occasionally heard ringing in the Chamber — so
              that the central office knows automatically when payments are made
              at a machine. As a result, only small sums of money are ever left
              in a parking meter, because it can be emptied when required. That
              removes the incentive to break into it. It also helps the
              Department to plan its collection of money. In addition, the

              It is an important subject, especially for those who wish to start
              walking to work, and for schoolchildren. ‘Investing for Health’,
              published in November 2000, and with targets for April 2001,
              contains the Department for Regional Development’s commitments
              as regards support and investment in health. When does the

              so that schoolchildren can avail of that option as opposed to
              having to use either public or private transport?</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That issue was discussed with officials and
              interest groups within the past few days. Due to the lengthy
              period of civil disturbance, many people thought it was safer to
              leave their children to school by car, even for very short
              journeys. The community needs to feel confident that the troubles
              are behind us. Until there is clear evidence of that, it will be
              hard to convince some people that they should choose walking as an
              alternative to taking their children to school by car.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Traffic-calming measures are an incentive for
              walking. The regional transportation strategy envisages a

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are 7·9 miles of motorway and 1·7 miles
              of dual carriageway in Counties Tyrone and Fermanagh. The majority
              of trunk roads in those counties are single-carriageway roads,

              routes.</p>
              <b>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I
              welcome the fact that the Minister and Sammy Wilson referred to
              Sinn Féin by its correct title, without any appendage, in the
              previous answer, and I thank them.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister will appreciate that Tyrone and
              Fermanagh depend heavily on roads infrastructure, because there is
              no rail network. The figures of 7·9 miles of motorway and 1·7
              miles of dual carriageway speak for themselves and show historic
              underinvestment. Can the Minister deliver a real commitment to
              increasing the number of dual carriageway and motorway miles in
              Tyrone and Fermanagh? A good start would be the roads from
              Dungannon to Ballygawley, Ballygawley to Omagh and Omagh to
              Strabane on the major arterial route, the A5, which carries much
              cross-border traffic.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the first council visits that I made as
              Minister was to Fermanagh District Council. As someone who
              represents the east of the Province, I was struck by the feelings
              of councillors from all parties who were present that the area had
              been given a very raw deal because money for roads went to where
              the traffic was heaviest, which is largely in the east of the
              Province. I said that it was necessary for us to examine the
              criteria under which we operate and to consider whether those
              criteria were fair, because funding based on those criteria could
              mean that there might never be new roads to the west of the
              Province.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Arising from the draft regional transportation
              strategy, I tasked my officials with reconsidering how we could
              start to provide stepped improvements. They will consider issues
              of affordability, priority and innovative procurement mechanisms
              with the regional transportation strategy team. In that context,
              issues such as the road between Dungannon and Ballygawley, which
              would be the outworking of such a policy, will be examined. I am
              seeking to do something more innovative than that which was laid
              out in the draft regional transportation strategy, and when the
              strategy is put before the Assembly, Members will see that the
              tweaking has made some difference.</p>

              particularly for the benefit of the IRA/Sinn Féin Member for West
              Tyrone — whether criteria exist for the construction of dual
              carriageways and motorways in Northern Ireland?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The manual indicates that, in general, a dual
              carriageway may be viable where more than 11,000 vehicles per day
              use a road: a similar volume of traffic applies when the viability
              of a motorway is being considered. The type of traffic and the
              extent to which the volume per day exceeds that figure must be
              examined. The availability of finance to carry out the work is
              also a factor.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The regional transport strategy will become a
              central element, and should the Assembly accept the strategy, it
              will envisage a significant increase in the amount of money
              available for roads and public transport schemes in Northern
              Ireland. Only by adopting such a scheme will we be able to meet
              the expectations of many district councillors and MLAs.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hussey:</p>

              through the Committee for Regional Development and the Chamber —
              that key regional transportation corridors should be dual
              carriageways. However, I understand the financial constraints.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Furthermore, the Minister will understand that
              the north-western and eastern areas of Northern Ireland have rail
              services, whereas the south-west does not. In rural areas, the
              nature of the vehicles involved is a major factor affecting
              average journey times. In that context, is the Minister
              considering the extension of the motorway to Ballygawley, or at
              least to the edge of West Tyrone? None of the 8·4 miles of
              motorway or dual carriageway mentioned are in that area.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is very easy to look at the road
              infrastructure on a map of Northern Ireland and see where
              significant improvements could be made. The guiding principle in
              the regional transportation strategy is that proposals must be
              earthed in reality: we must be capable of delivering them and,
              essentially, that means that the funding for schemes must be
              available.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree that strategic road corridors must be
              investigated first: many of them feed into the west of the
              Province. Improvements can be made — in some cases that will
              involve dual carriageways; in other cases different improvements
              can help. We must pay most attention to strategic road corridors.
              That principle was enunciated in the regional development
              strategy, which was the mother document of the regional
              transportation strategy.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Water Service has a strategy in place to
              identify, manage and control leakage in the water distribution
              system. The main elements are the installation and monitoring of
              district meters, pressure management schemes and leak detection
              and repair. Over the past four years, £22 million has been
              invested in leakage reduction measures. Approximately half of that
              was invested in setting up the essential leakage management
              infrastructure, including district meters and telemetry.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A further £25 million will be invested over
              the next four years. As the leakage infrastructure is well
              advanced, 80% of that expenditure will go directly to detecting
              and repairing leaks. The aim is to achieve the economic level of
              leakage by 2006.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister concede that water leakage of
              37% is unacceptable and costly? Given that the water resource
              strategy identified serious supply difficulties in the western
              area in 2000, with demand exceeding supply by six million litres a
              day, what action is the Department taking to address the
              infrastructure difficulties that are especially relevant to
              Counties Tyrone and Fermanagh, and the western half of County
              Derry?</p>
              <b>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The level of leakage is unacceptable, and that
              is why the Department has allocated increased funding. The leakage
              is the result of the ageing infrastructure, which is the legacy of
              years of neglect under direct rule. Nonetheless, we must make
              changes through leakage detection and remedial action to improve
              the infrastructure. Other changes will result from the water
              resource strategy, which the Department has submitted to the
              Committee for Regional Development. I hope to introduce that
              strategy to the Assembly soon by way of a take-note debate. As
              part of the water resource strategy, the Department will consider
              the issues, such as how it can meet any deficits between existing
              water supply and usage, to which Mr Byrne referred.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dalton:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Minister clarify what the leakage
              figure is? Mr Byrne quoted a figure of 37%, but I understood it to
              be more in the region of 33%. Does the figure change between
              night-time and daytime? Does the level of leakage reduce when the
              system is used more during the day? What proposals does the
              Minister have to fill the funding gap that will be left by
              improving the infrastructure?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is difficult to be precise about the
              percentage figure. The Department does not dare to refer to the
              lost water as leakage, although that is the common parlance. It is
              known as &quot;unaccounted-for water&quot;, and it is unaccounted
              for because no domestic metering takes place. Given that the
              Department knows how much water leaves the reservoirs, but does
              not know how much is used by domestic consumers, assessments are
              made. Whether the figure is 33% or 37% — I have even heard it
              estimated at 40% — is a matter of conjecture. However, the level
              is unacceptable and the problem must be addressed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The new telemetry will allow the Department to
              more accurately assess the areas in which leakage occurs, the
              amount of leakage and the time of day at which it takes place. I
              hope to be in a better position to answer the more detailed
              questions at a later stage.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Byrne managed to ask several questions. To
              answer his final one, the Department estimates that £3 billion
              will be needed over the next 20 years for infrastructural
              requirements for water and sewerage services. A similar amount
              will be required for roads and transportation. Therefore, there
              are significant infrastructural requirements, and the Assembly can
              make a good start towards addressing those by ceasing to spend up
              to £150 million a year on bureaucratic extravagance. Instead,
              that amount could be used to service a loan of around £2 billion
              that could really help water and road services.</p>

              on the information’s accuracy are made during the planning
              officer’s visit to the site. Representations made by third
              parties may also raise discrepancies in the applicant’s
              information. If the information on the application form has to be
              revised in the interests of accuracy, it will be re-advertised in

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will answer the second point first. The
              Assembly knows that the Department of the Environment has been
              viewed as somewhat of a Cinderella — funds have not been given
              to it in the past. However, additional funds have been supplied,
              there are more Planning Service officials in place, and, we trust,
              any shortfall has been improved. That is not to say that there is
              complacency or that we do not need more staff — quite the
              reverse. More staff may be needed. Indeed, we are looking at the
              whole process.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of the Environment is determined
              to correct inaccuracies. All addresses and descriptions of
              applications are checked for accuracy when they go in the press.
              As well as that, all the neighbour notification names must be
              inserted, and if they are not, there will be delays. The forms
              must be accurate. Last week, a seminar on planning matters was
              conducted with the construction industry at which the results of a
              survey carried out by a private consultancy firm were discussed.
              One of the points that the survey mentioned was that the process
              was slow because accuracy had to be checked.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore I remain convinced that the
              Department should insist on accuracy, and that inaccuracies cause
              delays.</p>

              property, and the accuracy of that claim is challenged by the

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Land ownership is important, but the term
              &quot;legal interest&quot; is more appropriate. Applicants must
              complete properly a P2 form where they must state their legal
              interest in the land. An applicant may or may not own the land,
              but he must declare that information. We do not check the accuracy
              of every form, but third parties have the opportunity to challenge
              applications, because they are publicly advertised. We endeavour
              to confirm the accuracy of the forms, but discrepancies and

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Northern Ireland countryside survey published
              by the Department of the Environment in November 2000 sets out the
              main changes in the countryside over a 10-year period up until
              1998. It identified a loss of species-rich grassland and wetland
              habitats as one of the main trends during that time.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Using data from the survey, my Department’s
              Environment and Heritage Service is developing several
              biodiversity action plans for important habitats and vulnerable
              species in Northern Ireland. The main means of protecting habitats
              and biological communities, as well as sites that are important
              for earth science conservation, is the declaration of Areas of
              Special Scientific Interest (ASSIs), under the Nature Conservation
              and Amenity Lands (Northern Ireland) Order 1985.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To date, the Department of the Environment has
              declared 196 ASSIs. Although most sites have remained in good
              condition following their declaration, there is evidence that some
              sites or parts of sites have been damaged, while others have
              deteriorated through neglect or inappropriate management. Weakness
              in the legislation has contributed to this situation. Following
              public consultation, the Department of the Environment has
              therefore been developing proposals to strengthen the legislation
              governing the protection and management of ASSIs. I recently
              circulated the proposals in the Executive, with a view to bringing
              a Bill before the Assembly in the next session.</p>

              cross-departmental co-operation aimed at providing the necessary
              resources to ensure protection — for example, farmers who may
              have difficulty in affording infrastructure on their farms? Also,
              will the Minister comment on the level of threat to protected
              habitats from other Government Departments?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Nesbitt:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are two elements in a cross-departmental
              aspect to farming. One is the farmers, and the other is the
              cross-departmental nature. There is cross-departmental
              co-operation, and I referred to this previously when I talked
              about working with the Minister of Agriculture and Rural
              Development, Bríd Rodgers. We have written and oral contact about
              what needs to be done, and when I had discussions with the Ulster
              Farmers’ Union, Ms Rodgers and I apprised each other.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With respect to the farming community, I am
              conscious that this aspect needs to be fostered. From the point of
              ownership of the land, 4,500 farmers or developers are responsible
              for the ASSIs they occupy, and we need their co-operation to
              manage ASSIs effectively. In bringing forward these proposals, we
              are trying to bring a balance in greater regulation and trying to
              get help in managing the ASSIs better. I am aware that farmers
              will be financially compensated for managing ASSIs. We must
              satisfy a Programme for Government commitment, which is to have a
              policy and a legislative framework for protecting and managing
              areas in place by July 2003.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are always mindful of what other Government
              Departments do. I have mentioned the example of the Department of
              Agriculture and co-operation with it.</p>

              own identity. I was in Holywood, which has its identity. I have
              visited Hillsborough, which has its identity. I have been to other
              places that have their identities. Each place has its own
              distinctive characteristic, which could be based on its
              architecture, history or layout. We must form an opinion, and if
              the buildings are listed buildings, they are likely to become
              conservation areas.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Others areas that would require a certain level
              of protection would become areas of townscape character. We must
              bear those important considerations in mind.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is also the issue of apartments that are
              being built in towns. The planning process dictates that 60% of
              dwellings have to be built in towns. We apply a mixture of general
              principles to particular circumstances.</p>

              and enforcement notices, but has not followed them up with court
              action when they have been ignored. What plans has he to reverse
              the previous practice of not enforcing those notices and to take

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am aware of concerns about the growth of
              apartment developments on such sites in south Belfast. In recent
              years, there has been a significant increase in the demand for
              small unit housing, including apartments. My Department has been
              seeking to clarify the planning policy context for dealing with
              those proposals.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member will be aware that the regional
              development strategy seeks to promote more sustainable forms of
              development through a two-pronged approach of encouraging compact
              urban forms and promoting more housing in existing urban areas.
              New residential development can, however, threaten local character
              and identity. The strategy also requires that densification should
              be achieved without town cramming — the forcing of overdeveloped
              and unsympathetic housing schemes into established residential
              areas.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Planning policy for housing is set out in my
              Department’s Planning Policy Statement 7 (PPS&nbsp;7) ‘Quality
              Residential Environments’. That statement requires developers to
              provide high-quality housing proposals on both brownfield and
              greenfield sites that are sympathetic to the character of an area,
              in order to avoid a level of intensification that can adversely
              affect local townscape character and identity. Sensitive
              judgements are required so that the correct balance is achieved
              between ensuring that proposals are sympathetic to their context,
              and have respect for local amenities, and seeking to achieve the
              target in the regional development strategy of increasing housing
              provision in existing urban areas.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Particular sensitivity is required in the
              primarily residential parts of conservation areas, and in areas of
              townscape character, where planning policy is to grant proposals
              involving intensification of site usage only in exceptional
              circumstances. PPS 7 also points out that the demolition of
              property will not create a presumption that permission for far
              more intensive and high-density development will be granted.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Department has also issued draft
              supplementary planning guidance in the form of Development Control
              Advice Note 8, ‘Small Unit Housing. New Development in Existing
              Residential Areas’, which it intends to publish in final form in
              the near future. That document provides more detailed guidance on
              proposals for small unit housing in existing urban areas. Although
              it does not set policy, it gives guidance to developers on the
              physical form of housing development, including apartments, and on
              the relationship with surrounding properties.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for his lengthy statement;
              it certainly clarifies many matters. Does he agree that the
              conservation area announced last year by his predecessor, Sam
              Foster, does not seem to have stopped the rot? The announcement of
              a conservation area in such a large area of south Belfast was very
              welcome. However, developments — and the threat of large
              developments — are still taking place.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Only last week, there was publicity surrounding
              a house in Ashley Avenue that was previously occupied by the poet
              Séamus Heaney. That house appears to have been left to rot and
              decay to the point where it will be demolished and replaced by an
              unsuitable block of flats. I am sure that the Minister has seen
              many of the sites in south Belfast, but I would be glad to invite
              him to inspect that site, either with or without my being present.
              There is a major issue to be resolved, as was highlighted by the
              case of Séamus Heaney’s former house in Ashley Avenue last
              week.</p>

              escalated, and the Government designated it a conservation area in
              2000. Therefore, express consent must be given for the demolition
              of any building, and new development must comply with PPS 6, which
              protects the character of conservation areas. That has been the

              before the Assembly, and I would also like to thank the Minister
              for his presence.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Lack of investment in roads means risks for
              road safety. I offer my deepest sympathy to the relatives of the
              latest victims of a serious road accident, on the Ballymena to
              Ballymoney road over the weekend. Recently, there was also a
              fatality on the A20.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although the A20 Newtownards to Portaferry road
              is a main arterial route carrying an ever-increasing number of
              vehicles every day, its condition, and the lack of funding for
              maintenance and upgrading, is replicated on every public road
              south of the floodgates as one leaves Newtownards, throughout the
              Ards borough and the Strangford constituency.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The deplorable conditions of our roads affect
              every constituent. Road users are angry and frustrated, and they
              ask constantly why they pay car tax. There is little or no
              industry on the Ards Peninsula, which means that constituents have
              to travel to where they can find employment, and the vast majority
              of people are forced to use the A20. Some people are employed on
              the other side of Strangford Lough, and they use the ferry and
              then travel on to their work.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I doubt that the conditions of the roads on the
              other side of Strangford Lough are much better. However, I offer
              sympathy to those who live in Portaferry and beyond who must use
              the main road to Newtownards twice daily to get to and from work.
              The A20 contains continuous twists, corners, humps and hollows,
              with a scattering of potholes, utility manhole covers, sunken
              gratings, sunken verges and flooding when there is heavy rainfall.
              All those deficiencies contribute to a less safe road environment,
              and, thus, we are vulnerable to road accidents, and,
              unfortunately, fatalities.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although the local Roads Service office does
              its best with its limited resources, I continue to hear from angry
              road users who have driven into a pothole and smashed a tyre and
              wheel, but who find it difficult to get compensation from the
              Roads Service. This morning I received a letter from a constituent
              who had lodged a claim for £64·63 against the Department for
              Regional Development as a result of damage caused by a pothole.
              After an eight-month investigation, that constituent was told:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;your claim for compensation has been
              unsuccessful. As the leaflet enclosed with your claim form
              explained, the DOE (NI) is obliged, under the relevant legislation
              — the Roads (Northern Ireland) Order 1993 — to maintain the
              roads to a reasonable standard.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Where it has not done so and a road user
              sustains damage to their vehicle because of this lack of
              maintenance, the legislation allows them to claim compensation
              from the Department.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On that occasion, a pothole contributed to £64
              worth of damage. However, the letter further states that</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;where the Department can show that it was
              carrying out a reasonable system of maintenance of the road in
              question, it is entitled to defend any claim for compensation
              brought under this legislation.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department dismissed this genuine claim for
              64 quid. The loophole seems typical; ordinary road users are
              treated abysmally. Other Members may have heard similar accounts.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The A20 has remained largely unchanged despite
              the ever-increasing volume of vehicular traffic and newer, larger
              lorries, which undoubtedly contribute to the deterioration of
              roads. A further concern is the risk of serious accidents
              involving the many school buses, sometimes overcrowded, on that
              road.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The appalling condition of the A20 at Main
              Street in Kircubbin must be brought to the Minister’s attention.
              As with all busy streets, a pedestrian crossing was needed on
              Kircubbin’s Main Street to increase the safety of children and
              senior citizens. The Roads Service denied a request for a
              crossing, and a concoction of kerb build-outs was provided, to the
              dissatisfaction of local residents. A request has been sent to the
              Roads Service for the build-outs’ removal, because they actually
              caused an accident. Recently, improvements were completed on a
              small section of Main Street in Greyabbey, which is also part of
              the A20, leaving the rest of the town in an appalling condition.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remind the Minister of his recently launched
              regional transport strategy, in which no forward plan for the Ards
              Peninsula was considered. In the summary of funding for each area,
              neither the Ards Peninsula, nor Portaferry, nor Kircubbin was even
              mentioned. There is not even a line on the map to show that the
              A20 exists.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As matters stand, the traffic congestion on the
              A20 can only get worse as more vehicles take to the road. Surely
              there has been some thought of future investment such as in the
              provision of a light rail system along the centre of the peninsula
              or a dual carriageway, or even widening the existing A20.
              Constituents expect, at minimum, extra funding for a good, even
              road surface that will allow safe passage without risking lives
              every day, and the Minister must give us a fair share of funding
              for better roads and for the A20 in particular.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am grateful to the MP, Mrs Iris Robinson, who
              set up a meeting with the Minister and the Roads Service to allow
              me to discuss the problems on behalf of my constituents.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hamilton:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many areas of great natural beauty suffer
              because of their attractiveness, and the Ards Peninsula is no
              exception. There are constant conflicts of interest between the
              legitimate economic needs of the local people, the equally
              legitimate need to conserve the undoubted natural beauty of the
              peninsula and the right of the population of Greater Belfast to
              enjoy the scenic resort value of the area, and finding a balance
              between those conflicting interests will never be easy. Added to
              that is the increased volume of traffic that is inevitably caused
              by the expanding towns along the A20, such as Greyabbey, Kircubbin
              and Portaferry.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The regional development plan envisages
              building some 7,000 extra dwellings on or around the peninsula in
              the next 10 years. Existing road traffic volume problems are bound
              to get worse and are important enough to be addressed, but
              underinvestment makes them doubly important.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have been raising the issue of
              underinvestment in the Ards Peninsula’s roads for some time, and
              the Minister for Regional Development’s answer to a question
              tabled by me on 12 March 2002 revealed its true extent. In
              1998-99, 1999-2000 and 2000-01 the amounts spent by the Department
              on roads in the boroughs of Ards and Castlereagh that comprise my
              constituency of Strangford tell a sorry tale. In the three
              successive years £453,000, £204,000 and £297,000 respectively
              was spent on roads in the borough of Ards. In the same years,
              £1,431,000, £408,000 and £1,167,000 was spent on the roads in
              Castlereagh. That means that a total of £954,000 was invested in
              the Ards roads in the three-year period compared to some
              £2,500,000 in the Castlereagh roads. Broadly, Castlereagh
              received 75% of the investment, while Ards received only 25%.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although I welcome the level of investment in
              Castlereagh, which is part of my constituency, I am alarmed at the
              year-after-year disparity between Castlereagh and Ards. Recurring
              disparities such as that soon build into major disadvantage, and
              Ards is approaching that situation.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.15 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am surprised that the Minister is not
              sensitive about this, as Castlereagh is his home territory and
              political stamping ground. It is only recently that his family
              interests have expanded, albeit temporarily, into Strangford. I
              would have thought that in the interests of the Minister’s own
              domestic bliss and harmony, he might listen to his lady wife, who
              represents Strangford at Westminster — at least for the time
              being. I am surprised that the Minister can stand over such a
              massive disparity in spending on roads in two adjacent borough
              council areas.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is even more revealing is the fact, again
              gleaned from the Minister’s answer to my question, that Ards
              Borough Council receives only 1% of Province-wide spending on
              roads. That happens year after year. There are 26 district
              councils, so that amounts to an average spend of around 4% in each
              council area, yet Ards receives only 1%. When that is compounded
              year after year, it amounts to disadvantage. The Minister’s
              argument that roads policy is decided Province-wide and is linked
              to traffic flow, the number of accidents, environmental impact and
              value for money is all very well. Those are factors in mitigation,
              but they are not substantive enough to explain the glaring 3:1
              disparity in spending on roads in two adjacent borough council
              areas. I welcome the spending on roads in Castlereagh. However,
              that disparity between the Ards average and the provincial average
              and the fact that an adjacent borough received three times as much
              as Ards must be explained.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Traffic flows on the Ards Peninsula must be
              addressed strategically before they inevitably worsen as a result
              of growing populations in key towns. The balance between business
              traffic, such as prawn and fish lorries from Portavogie, and
              domestic traffic that uses the A20 as its main route must also be
              addressed. Patterns of road utilisation — why the A20 is
              favoured over the Irish Sea coast road, for example — must be
              investigated. However, nothing beats investment. The Minister
              knows that, and so does the House. It seems that Ards has been
              left behind by all the standards of fairness. The Assembly must
              seek a commitment from the Minister that that will be addressed
              urgently.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I request investment for the A20 Newtownards to
              Portaferry road. That encompasses several roads along the Ards
              Peninsula. Those of us who use the A20 several times a day know
              that the road is notoriously dangerous, with its sharp corners and
              sweeping bends. Many residents are loath to use the road at night.
              Imagine one’s travel or activities being restricted because the
              main local road is too dangerous to travel at night.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The road is also dangerous in the rush hours:
              first thing in the morning and between 5.00 pm and 7.00 pm. A few
              months ago a car and its lady driver ended up on the lough shore.
              Luckily for that lady, the tide was out, or there could have been
              another fatality. In the past few months there have been two
              fatalities on the A20, and our thoughts are with those families
              who lost loved ones. The lady’s car ended up on the lough shore
              because there were no defensive barriers. She had to be cut free
              from the wreckage. The problem is compounded by the fact that the
              emergency services also use the A20 to reach people who have been
              injured. The road has received little investment in the past 20
              years.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCarthy has suggested that a pedestrian
              crossing is needed in Kircubbin. There have also been requests for
              pedestrian crossings at other locations, such as Greyabbey and
              Ballywalter.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Greyabbey is on the A20; Ballywalter is on the
              other side of the peninsula. There have been requests for
              pedestrian crossings but they have not yet been acceded to,
              primarily because of legal criteria on pedestrian crossings.
              Perhaps the Minister could inform us of the position on pedestrian
              crossings and whether there is any intention of changing those
              criteria so that the people who have requested, and badly need,
              pedestrian crossings in Greyabbey, Kircubbin and Ballywalter can
              have their requests met.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The same thing applies to traffic-management
              schemes. Local groups and elected representatives have requested
              that traffic-management schemes be put in place, again for
              Greyabbey and Ballywalter. Unfortunately, the necessary finance
              has not yet been forthcoming. The A20 has been given what I call
              &quot;reactionary repairs&quot;, which usually means patching up
              potholes and erecting defence barriers at accident black spots.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been very little concerted effort to
              bring the road into the twenty-first century. The volume of
              traffic is increasing, and as cars become more affordable as they
              come into line with European prices, it can only be assumed that
              there will be more cars in the future. Therefore, it would seem
              impossible for the Government not to spend money on the country’s
              infrastructure to keep up with the demands of the people. The
              infrastructure is at least 20 years out of date. The A20 has had
              little significant investment since the early 1980s. That is
              evident by the state of the road. The surface has been tinkered
              with, but there has been no significant work, such as
              road-widening.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The road floods at many places, and heavy
              rainfall makes it treacherous. If there is a storm, the road is
              closed because it is too dangerous to use. Waves from Strangford
              Lough crash onto the road, and sections of it have been eaten away
              by the storms, wind and tides that occur at certain times of the
              year. Closure of the road, as experienced this year, leaves many
              people stranded, adding at least 30 or 40 minutes to each journey,
              because drivers must use an alternative road down the middle of
              the Ards Peninsula. That can cause great difficulties in medical
              emergencies.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People’s lives have been, and continue to be,
              put at risk because of the lack of investment in the A20. A delay
              in the arrival of the emergency services because of the poor
              quality of the road or its closure could mean that someone who has
              suffered a stroke, heart attack or seizure, or even someone who
              has been involved in a traffic accident, does not get the urgent
              attention that they need.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The situation is compounded by the fact — and
              this is not the Minister’s responsibility — that the
              Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety will not
              set up an ambulance outstation on the peninsula, leaving it to be
              covered by the Ards depot, which must use the A20, which is
              sometimes cut off from Newtownards. If the Department of Health,
              Social Services and Public Safety is not prepared to help the
              people of the lower peninsula, we urge the Minister for Regional
              Development to use his Department’s influence to try to ensure
              that that scheme goes ahead.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Investment is needed to ensure that the A20 is
              accessible and safe for all. The maintenance budget for the past
              10 years has remained almost unchanged. Although the volume of
              traffic and demands on the road have increased, it is a pity that
              the money that is needed simply to maintain the road — not to
              build a new road — has not matched those demands. The road must
              be made safe and user-friendly and must be able to withstand the
              increasing volume of traffic not just over the past 20 years, but
              also over the next 20 years.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The road will carry more and more tourists.
              Ards Borough Council is committed to a tourism policy, and more
              tourists are visiting as a result. If more tourists should come to
              the country, we will try to attract them to the peninsula’s
              shores. It is therefore imperative that visitors have a safe,
              modern road when they visit what we believe are some of the most
              historic and beautiful sites in Northern Ireland. For those of us
              who live in the area, Strangford Lough is undoubtedly the jewel in
              the crown of the Ards Peninsula, if not the whole of Northern
              Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are roads dating back to the 1970s and
              1980s. More infrastructure investment is needed, especially on the
              A20, so that we can make the most of the area and improve the
              overall impression of the country and the area that we represent.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr C Wilson:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Kieran McCarthy for bringing this
              matter up. I have clocked up hundreds of thousands of miles on
              that road over the past 40 years, and I know every corner and
              every twist and turn in it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All of us could describe horrific accidents
              that have occurred on the road. If the statistics were made known,
              and given the length of the road, it is probably one of the
              greatest accident black spots in the Province. Many of my
              constituents refer to it as &quot;the highway to hell&quot;
              because of the numbers of fatalities that have occurred and the
              number of people who have been severely injured and who will have
              to be cared for for the rest of their lives.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regarding the condition of the road — apart
              from its dangerous corners and twists — public transport
              providers have said that vehicles using the A20 require more
              frequent replacement of suspension and shock absorbers than those
              on any other route throughout the Province. That is a fair
              indication of the poor condition of the A20.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The condition of the road, coupled with
              underinvestment in road infrastructure on the Ards Peninsula and
              the massive development that is taking place along its length and
              breadth, makes a very dangerous cocktail. The A20 cannot deal with
              the current volume of traffic.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would be interesting if the Department were
              to examine the number of planning applications that have been
              approved in the last four or five years, together with those
              currently coming on stream. Mr Hamilton referred to 7,000 new
              dwellings in the Ards area, and few people know that many of those
              houses are being built between the floodgates and Portaferry.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A disproportionate number of houses are being
              built at the tip of the Ards Peninsula; there are plans to build
              between 900 and 1,200 dwellings close to my home. If we accept
              that there are two cars per dwelling — and few families have
              fewer than two cars: families with growing children sometimes have
              more — there is the potential for many thousands more vehicles
              to be thrown onto those roads in the coming years.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Planning Service needs to address the
              problem immediately. People in the villages, towns and hamlets on
              both sides of the Ards Peninsula must demand answers from the
              Planning Service about why it can continue to approve large-scale
              building developments when it is known that the road and sewerage
              infrastructures are not capable of dealing with the current
              situation. Developers are driving a coach and horses through the
              legislation.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.30 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All Members, especially those who serve on Ards
              Borough Council, know that developers deliberately avoid public
              inquiries into some large-scale developments by submitting their
              planning applications piecemeal. They apply for planning
              permission for 100 dwellings or fewer, rather than for the full
              number of dwellings that they intend to develop. I do not know
              how, but that must be addressed. It must be made clear that the
              Planning Service will place a moratorium on large-scale building
              developments on the Ards Peninsula until the infrastructure has
              been dealt with. No one is grasping the nettle.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before anything happens, we shall hear of more
              fatalities. I appeal to those with responsibility to give top
              priority to the Newtownards to Portaferry road; it deserves
              nothing less.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister for Regional Development (Mr P
              Robinson):</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate Mr McCarthy on securing the
              Adjournment debate and for raising an important subject that is of
              concern to all Members from his constituency.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The A20 from Newtownards to Portaferry, which
              is 19 miles long, is, as Mr McCarthy stated, sinuous in nature,
              following as it does for much of its length the inside coast of
              the Ards Peninsula. It is the main route servicing the peninsula,
              and passes through the villages of Greyabbey and Kircubbin. It
              carries a two-way traffic flow and is the main distributor road
              southwards on the Ards Peninsula.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Traffic flow decreases towards Portaferry.
              Although the most recent data shows that the traffic level just
              south of Newtownards stands at about 10,400 vehicles a day, at the
              Portaferry end it decreases to 2,700 vehicles a day. The road is a
              standard single carriageway on which the 60 miles an hour national
              speed limit applies — except through the villages to which I
              referred, where a 30 miles an hour speed limit applies. A large
              amount of holiday and leisure traffic uses the route at weekends
              and during the summer months. It is, therefore, an important road
              and commuter route for those who live on the peninsula. Although
              passing opportunities are severely limited by the road’s
              alignment, and slow-moving vehicles can cause driver frustration,
              no specific congestion occurs on the route.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Roads Service recently carried out several
              improvement schemes on the route, directed at road safety. They
              include an environmental improvement scheme, costing £110,000,
              that was substantially completed in Greyabbey earlier this year.
              In addition to environmental aspects, that scheme also improved
              the profile of Lower Main Street and incorporated carriageway
              resurfacing, street lighting, a short length of footpath at the
              local primary school and improved signing to show the school’s
              proximity to the carriageway. I have noted some of Mr McCarthy’s
              criticisms, and I shall consider them.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCarthy also criticised the traffic-calming
              scheme that was completed in Kircubbin last month at a cost of
              £18,000. The scheme included the provision of entry gateway
              features, lay-by central road markers, kerb buildouts, colour
              surfacing and signing. I shall consider the Member’s criticism
              of the kerb buildouts.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A scheme costing £10,000 to provide higher
              friction surfacing and a crash barrier at a bend at Ballygarvan
              was completed in September 2001, and an £8,000 improvement scheme
              at Kelly’s Corner was completed in September 1999. In addition
              to those improvement schemes, during the past seven years the
              Roads Service has resurfaced, or surface-dressed, some five miles
              between Newtownards and Portaferry. That is about a quarter of the
              19-mile route. That work cost approximately £300,000.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was privileged to launch the new ferry, the
              MV Portaferry II, for the Strangford Lough ferry service last
              January. That was paid for by the Roads Service budget for the
              area. The new vessel cost approximately £2·7 million and was
              essential for the development of social and economic links between
              the Ards Peninsula and south Down.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Members are aware, the resources available
              for the roads programme are finite, and funds for major road
              improvements are being targeted largely at schemes to upgrade the
              regional strategic transport network as defined in the regional
              development strategy. I would point out to Members who criticise
              the proposed regional transportation strategy — because we have
              not had that strategy yet — that there are no specific schemes
              for the area. The regional development strategy, which was
              unanimously supported by the Assembly, did not include the A20, so
              the Roads Service has no plans to upgrade the route significantly.
              The Roads Service recognised that it had to concentrate on the
              regional strategic transport network as opposed to other roads.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Resources available for those schemes would not
              permit a comprehensive realignment scheme, so any changes to the
              A20 would have to be carried out through minor road improvements
              or road maintenance schemes. That will require the Department to
              look at several issues, such as the realignments and accident
              reviews. We would also look at temporary calming assessment
              proposals as well as targeting accident sites for possible
              re-engineering. In that context, the Roads Service is assessing
              the feasibility of a bend realignment scheme at Ballygarvan. If
              the scheme is viable, it will be considered for possible inclusion
              in the future minor works programme. The Roads Service also plans
              to surface-dress a three quarter mile section of the A20 north of
              the Cunningham Road and south of the Mountstewart Road later this
              year.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Considering that it is not part of the regional
              strategic network, I trust that the investments that I have
              mentioned illustrate that my Department will continue to be
              committed to doing what is possible in the area using the
              available resources.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to respond to some of the specific
              points raised in the debate. Mr McCarthy mentioned compensation,
              and that is always a matter of concern for those who seek
              compensation because their vehicles have been damaged but who do
              not automatically get it through the Department. However, that is
              only the first stage of the process, and people can challenge any
              decision by the Department for Regional Development in the courts.
              The Department has been severely criticised for paying out
              directly and without testing claims. It was criticised by the
              Westminster Public Accounts Committee in one case for meeting
              compensation claims. The Department is required to have objective
              criteria to determine whether payments are made.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member also asked the rhetorical question
              about where the car tax goes. However, he moved on quickly because
              I suspect he knows the answer. The money goes to the Exchequer;
              unfortunately, not to the Department for Regional Development.
              However, there has been some talk, although it has not amounted to
              much, that there will be some direct hypothecation for car tax.
              That would be desirable.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hamilton, the Member for Strangford, made a
              mean-spirited statement that did not relate to the subject, but as
              he has put it on the public record it is right that it should be
              answered. It is curious that someone who sneaked into the Assembly
              through the back door and who has no mandate to be here would call
              someone a temporary Member, even though that Member has been
              elected by the people and has a clear majority at Westminster.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member is more likely than any elected
              representative to be given that label. He was obviously never an
              accountant and is incapable of understanding statistics, or he
              would not have made those remarks. Those Strangford electors who
              live in Castlereagh will be interested to note how little he cares
              for their welfare. Those who live in Ards will not consider him to
              have done them any favours when they realise the way in which he
              mangled the statistics to reach that conclusion. If he had looked
              at the Roads Service budget for the Ards area as a whole, he would
              have seen that expenditure over the past three years has been
              greater in Ards than in Castlereagh. However, the Member managed
              to exclude parts of the roads budget, such as the expenditure on
              the Strangford ferry. He should not demean that, because it is
              only by its inclusion in the budget as a &quot;road
              extension&quot; that it can be paid for by the Department for
              Regional Development.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hamilton:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Minister give way?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will give way in a moment, but first I will
              really give the Member something to answer.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, the Member did not bother to
              mention that I announced my Department’s intention to construct
              the Comber bypass at the cost of some £3 million to £4 million.
              If he were to add that to his figures, he might well find that it
              would be the people of Castlereagh who would be asking why they
              were getting the rough end of the stick. I will give way to the
              Member, and I hope that he has more sense this time.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hamilton:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister accept that the figures that
              I gave were from a written answer, provided by his Department?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No, I do not accept that. Those figures were
              only part of the answer. If the Member cannot take the information
              in by listening, he might like to read it in the report of the
              proceedings. If he had listened to what I said, he would know that
              the total expenditure is greater than the sum of the figures that
              he added together. If he were to look at the total roads
              expenditure — rather than only the items that he decided to take
              into account — he would see that Ards comes ahead of Castlereagh.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I pointed out to him, the further
              expenditure that has been announced by the Department for Regional
              Development for the Comber bypass will put Ards well ahead of
              Castlereagh. Therefore when those figures are produced for him, I
              hope that the Member will show as much interest in the Castlereagh
              electors of Strangford as he does in the Ards electors of
              Strangford.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The distribution of expenditure is decided
              objectively by the Roads Service professionals on the basis of the
              needs in the various areas of the Province. If the Member does not
              like money being spent on the regional strategic transport
              network, he will have to explain to his constituents why the
              Assembly unanimously supported it. I did not hear any voice from
              Strangford saying that it was the wrong policy to adopt.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also important to say that there has been
              a significant increase in the proposals for the Strangford
              constituency since devolution. I have heard no words of thanks or
              praise from the Member for the substantial increase since
              devolution and since I have had responsibility for the Department.
              It contrasts with the negligence during the years when his party
              had the Strangford parliamentary seat and, therefore, the
              responsibility for bringing infrastructural improvements into the
              area.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Various Members, including Mr Cedric Wilson and
              Mr Jim Shannon, spoke about road safety in the constituency, and
              it is a matter of significant concern. Believe it or not, I could
              quote the professional findings of the comparative road safety
              record for this area, as opposed to the rest of the Province. The
              figure is almost exactly the same as the Province-wide average,
              which is not a particularly high level. However, Members are right
              to say that it is still high. The road accident statistics for
              Northern Ireland are much higher than any Government Minister
              would find acceptable, and, therefore, we must deal with the
              problem.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We therefore have a policy. Road accidents
              occur for many different reasons. Road accidents are not always
              the fault of the road and are not always something that can be
              dealt with by a Minister. One determines whether it is the fault
              of the road by looking at road accident clusters. A cluster is a
              series of accidents that have occurred at the same spot over three
              years. However, there are no clusters on the peninsula. There have
              been several accidents, but they have not followed any particular
              locational pattern, which makes it more difficult to get an
              engineering response.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.45 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue raised by Cedric Wilson with regard
              to what I would describe as &quot;incremental development&quot; is
              a sleight of hand and is not restricted to developers on the
              peninsula. Many developers across the Province attempt to avoid
              any major infrastructural improvement by putting in a lower level
              of houses for development. Although the number they put in might
              be dealt with by the existing road network or by some minor
              changes to it, they still have to bring forward their further
              proposals. Those are then factored into the requirements for the
              infrastructure. If the two proposals together require major
              improvements, then the second part of their development must carry
              that infrastructural cost. Although they may get away in the smoke
              in the first instance, when they come back for the full scheme
              they will be caught.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Department’s Roads Service will always
              give advice to the Department of the Environment’s Planning
              Service on these issues. However, as Minster, I am not satisfied
              with the present arrangements for developer contributions. Changes
              are required, not just for roads but for water as well. The
              proposed regional transport strategy has a section dealing with
              funding through developer contributions, and we need to look at
              these issues.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon made the point about pedestrian
              crossings. Both he and Mr McCarthy have raised the issue of a
              pedestrian crossing in this area with me, and I have agreed to
              look at this. Even with the technical advice I get, I find it very
              difficult to unravel the formula for pedestrian crossings, which
              is almost like an algebraic formula. If we are going to make
              people believe that we are following objective criteria, we
              require objective criteria that they understand. We need to get
              the road-speak out of the formula so that people can understand
              how the decisions are taken — what is the factor that can cause
              a change in the decision to put a pedestrian crossing in place or
              not. I am happy to look at that issue so that we can have a
              formula that is more easily understood and has greater public
              confidence.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, I am aware that the Member of
              Parliament for the area has been seeking a meeting to look at
              these issues, and I will ensure that this meeting is set up and
              processed. We can arrange a site visit, as it is always much
              better to see these issues first-hand. We can then see what steps
              can be taken beyond those I have already referred to.</p>
