                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Initial Presiding Officer, can you assure
                the Assembly that the notification that you have just read was
                communicated to every party in the Assembly and that the Ulster
                Unionists, in particular, are aware that the Assembly is
                meeting? We need to know that they knew about the sitting but
                did not want to come and take a stand to exclude Sinn Féin from
                the Executive.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All reasonable precautions were taken to
                ensure that all Members and all parties were informed, and I
                have no reason to believe that any were not.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further to that point of order, Mr Initial
                Presiding Officer. Would it be correct to conclude that the
                First Minister (Designate) had, of course, been informed that
                the Assembly was meeting?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have nothing to add to my previous comment.
                Under Initial Standing Order 22(2)(b), notice of a motion under
                Standing Order 24(1) or (2) requires the Presiding Officer to
                defer the procedure for the appointment of Ministers (Designate)
                until the Assembly has voted on that motion but, subsequent to
                that vote, requires him immediately to proceed. I have received
                such a notice of motion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before taking the motion, I wish to make two
                rulings which shall apply to this first item of business.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, while giving notice of a motion under
                Standing Order&nbsp;24 has no specific requirements, the moving
                of such a motion requires that one of three criteria must be
                met. These criteria are set out under Standing Order 24(5). As I
                have received no notice under Standing Order 24 5(b) or (c) I
                shall invite the proposer to provide evidence that criterion (a)
                is met. I will accept written notice bearing the signature of
                30&nbsp;Members, or the support of 30&nbsp;Members demonstrated
                by their rising in their places, or both.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If this criterion is met the motion may be
                moved and the debate will proceed. If it is not met I will not
                allow the motion to be moved and the procedure for the
                appointment of Ministers (Designate) shall immediately proceed
                as required by Standing Order&nbsp;22(2).</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In either event my second ruling shall apply.
                It is that, once commenced, the procedure under Standing
                Order&nbsp;22 will not be interrupted except by leave of the
                Assembly or in terms described by Standing Order&nbsp;22(7)
                where a nominating officer requests a brief adjournment. This
                second ruling is based on the practice described in ‘Erskine
                May’, page&nbsp;319, which explains that an order of the day
                must be proceeded with, arranged for a future day or discharged.
                In the case of the Order Paper, and specifically item&nbsp;3, it
                is clear that the first option only is available to the
                Assembly. If those rulings are clear I shall proceed.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This Assembly resolves that Sinn&nbsp;Féin
                does not enjoy the confidence of the Assembly because it is not
                committed to non-violence and exclusively peaceful and
                democratic means and, therefore, consistent with Standing
                Order&nbsp;24(2)(a), determines that members of Sinn&nbsp;Féin
                shall be excluded from holding office as Ministers or Ministers
                (Designate) for a period of 12&nbsp;months beginning with the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Initial
                Presiding&nbsp;Officer. I require clarification with regard to
                Standing Order&nbsp;24(5). As we have provided evidence that
                29&nbsp;Members support this motion, do you require evidence of
                the support of just one more Member for a debate to go forward?
                And is it the case that the thirtieth person need not be someone
                who will vote for the motion at the end, but simply one who is
                prepared as a democrat to have it debated? Any Member, even
                though he does not intend to support the content of the motion
                at the end of the debate, can, in order that we may have a
                debate, rise in his place and indicate support for it.</p>

                this motion stands in the name of 29&nbsp;Members, representing
                the Democratic Unionist Party, the United Kingdom Unionist
                Party, the Northern Ireland Unionist Party, the United Unionist
                Assembly Group and one Ulster Unionist, Mr&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;Weir.
                Isn’t it a united Unionist motion which has the full support
                of this side of the House?</p>

                Therefore I must ask Dr&nbsp;Paisley whether he can satisfy the
                requirements of Standing Order&nbsp;24(5)(a). Does the motion

                the matter to the Assembly to determine the number of
                supporters. We received no notice from Mr Weir that he had

                therefore ask whether there are any Members other than the
                28&nbsp;signatories who support the proposal for the moving of
                this motion. If there are any, will they stand in their places?</p>

                exercisable by the holders of such offices after the appointed
                day, was agreed with cross-community support.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am now required by the Initial Standing

                party, in the order required by the formula contained in the
                Initial Standing Orders, to select an available ministerial
                office (designate) and nominate a person to hold it who is a

                time to consider a selection or a nomination, it is open to me
                to permit a brief suspension. However, if no such request is
                made, if the nominating officer does not make the selection or
                nomination required within the maximum period of five minutes,
                or if the nominee does not take up the selected ministerial
                office (designate) within that period in accordance with the
                Initial Standing Orders, I am required to disregard the
                nominating officer and his party for the purposes of filling the
                remaining ministerial offices (designate). I will then ask the
                nominating officer next in line, in accordance with the required
                formula, to select and nominate. I should also explain that,
                under the terms of the Initial Standing Orders, the First
                Minister (Designate) and the Deputy First Minister (Designate)

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since 1 July I have worked with the two
                Governments, my party and all the other parties to give effect
                to that pledge. For over a year the fundamental institutional
                elements of that agreement have not been implemented. We have
                all benefited from unparalleled time, support and energy from
                the Prime Minister, Tony&nbsp;Blair, and the Taoiseach, Bertie&nbsp;Ahern,
                and, though it has become fashionable in recent weeks to
                criticise the Secretary of State, the reality is that without
                her efforts, her willingness to think the unthinkable and her
                resolve we would never have had the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The key element of the pledge which was taken
                by the First Minister and myself was our commitment to work in
                good faith to bring into being the institutions set out in the
                Good Friday Agreement. That agreement received overwhelming
                support in Ireland, North and South, Unionist and Nationalist,
                in the referenda of 22&nbsp;May&nbsp;1998. That overwhelming
                support endures, despite the frustrations of implementation and
                the limitations of leadership. Since 1&nbsp;July, deadline after
                deadline has been missed: 31&nbsp;October, the day specified for
                the inaugural meeting of the North/South Ministerial Council;
                10&nbsp;March&nbsp;1999; Hillsborough; Downing Street; Castle
                Buildings; ‘The Way Forward’; and the legislation to ensure
                the fail-safe clause. Permutation after permutation has been
                tried. We have tried, and I have tried, every move in the book
                and outside it to ensure that this agreement worked and that the
                institutions were set up.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On 2&nbsp;July&nbsp;1999, in ‘The Way
                Forward’ document presented by the two Prime Ministers, the
                Governments set out the best possible way of resolving this
                impasse. It embodies principles that I have always espoused.
                First, that decommissioning is not a prior condition in the Good
                Friday Agreement. Secondly, that it is an obligation under the
                Good Friday Agreement. Reflecting this in ‘The Way Forward’,
                the Governments set out three commitments agreed by all the
                parties: an inclusive Executive exercising devolved powers;
                decommissioning of all paramilitary arms by May&nbsp;2000; and
                decommissioning to be carried out in a manner determined by the
                International Commission on Decommissioning.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most importantly, in order to provide
                reassurance, the Governments agreed a fail-safe clause. It
                provided that if decommissioning were not carried out as
                specified by the International Commission all institutions would
                be suspended. It also provided that if there were no inclusive
                Executive all institutions would similarly be suspended. This
                reflects guarantees that I gave at our party conference last
                November — one to Unionists in the event that decommissioning
                did not occur and one to Sinn Féin in the event that the
                Executive was not truly inclusive. Those two guarantees were
                rooted in the conviction that those who reneged on the agreement
                could not expect to continue in office. Both are now formally
                copper-fastened in this fail-safe clause.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the Ulster Unionist Party says that
                that is not enough. It used this crisis to get more concessions
                out of two sovereign Governments in order to bleed the process
                dry. They stand by their demand for prior decommissioning — a
                condition that is found nowhere in the agreement, and one that
                is alien to its principles.</p>

                order. I shall take this one after the Deputy First Minister has
                resumed his seat.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister (Designate):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thank you, Mr Presiding Officer. I insisted,
                with your permission, that I do the House the courtesy of making
                my statement here and not elsewhere. I shall continue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ulster Unionists stand by their demand
                for prior decommissioning — a condition that is not found in
                the Good Friday Agreement, and one that is alien to its
                principles. What they are doing is worse than failing to operate
                an inclusive Executive: they are actually preventing its
                creation. They are dishonouring this agreement; they are
                insulting its principles.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over the past year more space has been sought
                and more given, and on each occasion more space is required.
                More time is then needed and more understanding of the
                difficulties, real or imaginary, that are faced. The best
                efforts of two Governments and of the parties, even in recent
                days, have borne no fruit. I speak not just of my efforts as
                Deputy First Minister but also of those of the Secretary of
                State, the Prime Minister, the Taoiseach and the President of
                the United States. When, in the past, could we have had such
                support? When can we hope to have such support again? It is a
                matter of genuine regret that others could not, and did not,
                respond to their relentless efforts. There has been visit after
                visit and meeting after meeting day after day. Regrettably —
                and I say this more in sorrow than in anger — those efforts
                have been not just spurned but scorned.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is now clear that the two Governments will
                have to initiate a review under the terms of this agreement.
                They must ensure that that review is not a means to buy time for
                any political party but the fundamental review envisaged in the
                agreement. Everyone must go into it as an equal. I and the SDLP
                will co-operate fully with the review under those terms, without
                the trappings of office or the benefits of title. That review is
                now the future of the political process. If the leader of the
                Ulster Unionists wishes to speak for his party in the review he
                should do so as its leader and only as its leader. He cannot do
                so from the privileged position of First Minister of the
                Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The agreement does not belong to any
                individual or party. It belongs to the people. They voted for
                it. They own it. Consistent with my pledge, I am obliged to
                uphold it on their behalf. For that reason, and that reason
                alone, I have concluded that it is my overriding responsibility
                to uphold, above all else, the democratic will of the people of
                Ireland, North and South, expressed, as never before, in the
                referenda of May&nbsp;1998 endorsing the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is now necessary that I resign as Deputy
                First Minister. I wish to inform the Assembly that, accordingly,
                I offer my resignation now, with immediate effect. It was this
                Assembly that elected me to that position, and it is essential
                that I announce my resignation to the Assembly. I do this with
                great reluctance and with a recognition of the awesome
                responsibility that we all have towards lasting peace and the
                future of all of the people of Northern&nbsp;Ireland. I now
                believe that this is the only way in which I can ensure that a
                meaningful review of aspects of the agreement will be carried
                out and that, subsequently, a fully inclusive Executive can be
                created on the basis of cross-community support.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank you, Mr Presiding Officer, and
                Members of the Assembly for your indulgence towards me. They may
                now understand why I had to be a little long-winded. I hope that
                I have made it clear that I respect each and every person in the
                House and the views of them all. I do not treat the Assembly
                with contempt.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have one or two comments about that

                during a personal statement. That is why I left them to the end.
                Secondly, it seems to me — I have to make this decision on the
                hoof — that the personal statement by the now former Deputy
                First Minister (Designate) was of such substance and importance
                that the party leaders in the Chamber ought to have an
                opportunity to respond to it. Mr&nbsp;Adams has already
                indicated his wish to speak, and he will therefore be called
                next.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have received an indication from the
                Secretary of State that she wishes to confer with me, but I have
                sent back advice that the party leaders in the House ought first
                to have an opportunity to make their comments. As you know, we
                have a remit from the Secretary of State under the Elections
                Act, but I have sought her indulgence to enable us to continue
                for the present.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Usually there is no time limit on personal

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not understand this. A Member is told
                that something is to happen and asks you if he may speak
                afterwards, and he is called before the House even knows that
                that has happened. None of the rest of us knew. I was not told,
                as the leader of the third-largest party, that there was to be a
                statement. I was not afforded that courtesy, so I was not able
                to ask beforehand to speak. However, I asked in the middle of
                the speech — as soon as I could.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If it had been a personal statement
                Mr&nbsp;Adams would have had to be ruled out of order because
                there is no debate on a personal statement. But because this
                deteriorated into a savage attack on people who have different
                principles from those of the hon Gentleman we are having a
                debate. If it had been a personal statement you would have had
                to rule that Mr&nbsp;Adams could not be called. That is my

                resignation and reappointment? Does the position of the First
                Minister (Designate) automatically fall as a result of the
                resignation of the Deputy First Minister (Designate)? Was that
                resignation given to you in writing? Does it have to be in
                writing? If so, may we have copies of it? We need answers to
                these questions so that we can put this issue in its proper
                context.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall answer the questions as best I can.
                There is no requirement for the First Minister (Designate) or
                the Deputy First Minister (Designate) to put his resignation in
                writing prior to devolution. The appointments fall under the
                Initial Standing Orders under the Elections Act — they are not
                under the substantive Standing Orders which would exist under
                the Northern Ireland Act — and so there is no need for
                resignations to be given in writing. This resignation has not
                been given in writing, and you have heard the statement. The
                only written version will be in the Official Report.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will recall that the First Minister
                (Designate) and the Deputy First Minister (Designate) were
                elected — I use the common parlance — &quot;on a
                slate&quot;. Were we in a post-devolution situation and
                operating under the Northern Ireland&nbsp;Act both positions
                would fall when one Minister resigned, but the remaining
                individual would continue in a caretaker capacity for up to
                six&nbsp;weeks. Before the end of that period the Presiding
                Officer would call for a further election. However, we are still
                functioning under the Northern&nbsp;Ireland (Elections) Act for
                these purposes, and therefore the position of the First Minister
                (Designate), as I understand it — and you have simply asked me
                for an immediate view — is unchanged. It is possible that some
                Standing Order, or other arrangement, is already on the way, but
                I have no knowledge of it.</p>

                at the farce that we have seen here today. Many people will be

                While he and I did not agree all of the time, he did his best.
                And we can expect no more from people than that they do their
                best. I want to pay tribute to the way he conducted himself as
                Deputy First Minister (Designate).</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was rising to make a point about
                Mr&nbsp;Trimble’s deliberate absence from here and about all
                the efforts that have been made by many people — by the two
                Governments, some of the parties here, the President and the
                former President of South&nbsp;Africa and the President of the
                USA, but more importantly, perhaps, by the people of this
                island, north and south, who voted for the agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There will be young people at university or
                working in England or Scotland today who have decided not to
                come home. There will be young people listening to or watching
                these proceedings — mostly Unionists — deciding to leave and
                not come back. There will be business people deciding not to
                invest.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am sure that at a personal level
                Dr&nbsp;Paisley is a nice man. I am sure that as a husband, as a
                father, as a grandfather and even when with his colleagues he
                can be charming, affectionate and funny. But here, in terms of
                his leadership of a section of our people and of the type of
                climate and politics that he has been involved in throughout his
                adult life — in particular the last 30&nbsp;years — his
                behaviour has been disgraceful.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The absence of the UUP, and especially of the
                First Minister (Designate), is also disgraceful.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Good Friday Agreement was a compromise.
                It was a compromise between all the elements on this island,
                particularly those in the North. The people of a Unionist view
                — those within civic Unionism, those within community
                activism, those within the main Protestant churches and those in
                the business community — must this morning feel disappointed
                at what happened yesterday in Glengall&nbsp;Street. The only
                reason the UUP moved to Glengall&nbsp;Street is that they can be
                sure that no Nationalist can get in there. They can be sure that
                no Catholic can get in there.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is not about guns and the hero of
                Clontibret and the founder of Ulster Resistance and those who
                were involved in all the different armed organisations over the
                last 30&nbsp;years. We have only to think of the career of
                Brian&nbsp;Nelson and the current attacks on isolated Catholics
                and Nationalists, with weapons brought in by him, some of which
                were brought in by Ulster Resistance. We have only to think of
                all of that.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would be easy to give vent to justifiable
                and righteous anger, but let me look to the future. We have
                placed firmly on the record our position in relation to the
                British Government’s handling of recent developments. But if
                the Unionists think that the equality agenda is going to
                disappear they are mistaken. The equality agenda is only
                beginning. If the Unionists think that they are going to hold on
                to the RUC they are mistaken. We still need a new policing
                service for all the people of this state. If Unionists think
                that human-rights legislation will not be enacted nor a
                human-rights regime created and that all the other social,
                economic, cultural and political matters will not proceed they
                are sorely mistaken. Mr&nbsp;Blair and the Taoiseach,
                Mr&nbsp;Ahern, have a huge responsibility to proceed, to develop
                and move forward on all the other aspects of the agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am an Irish Republican, and as the
                executive leader of Sinn Féin I had to lead the party into this
                Chamber. That was a huge step for us to take. It was a huge step
                in trying to face up to our responsibilities. I believe in the
                Irish national flag, in peace and equality between Orange — in
                this month of the Orange — and Green. I believe that, despite
                the best efforts of our Colleagues on the opposite Bench and
                those Colleagues who are absent, we will bring about on this
                island the type of society in which young people can grow up
                free from sectarian hatred and imprisonment and, yes, free from
                violence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have acknowledged all the hurt that all of
                us have both inflicted and endured. The Members on this Bench
                survived &quot;bloody Sunday&quot; and, on 5&nbsp;October, Duke
                Street. We have been CS-gassed; we have been CR-gassed; we have
                been plastic-bulleted; we have been in H-blocks; we have been on
                prison ships; and we have been in prison cells. As we conclude
                this little farce, we still look for sensible, positive Unionism
                to grasp the opportunity to take its place with the rest of us
                on this island, in harmony, in justice and in peace with each
                other.</p>

                detailed work that he has done as Deputy First Minister in

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A personal statement on a resignation in
                another place would be listened to, and there would be no debate
                on it. Usually, party leaders would know that it was going to
                take place, but I had no knowledge of this one. I have no
                objection to any Member, let alone the Deputy First Minister,
                exercising his rights.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remind Mr&nbsp;Mallon that my party did not
                vote for him, that he had no support from us. When he was
                elected we knew where he stood and what his principles and aims
                were. We said that we would be concentrating totally on opposing
                his aims. He knew that well. I have nothing further to say with
                regard to his statement. However, he took the opportunity to
                launch a broadside upon those Members with principles —
                principles that they will not forgo regardless of the cost.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the derogatory remarks made by
                Gerry&nbsp;Adams. I would not like him to say &quot;Well done,
                Ian&quot;. He has said &quot;Well done, David&quot;, but he is
                not so inclined to say &quot;Well done, David&quot; today. I
                know that the IRA bombers and killers hate me and that I am on
                their hit list. On two occasions they have attempted to kill me.
                I know all about that. It does not concern me one iota.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But today the Member has maligned the people
                of Northern Ireland. I represent the majority of Unionists in
                Northern Ireland. I speak as their mandated leader, and he has
                to realise that the dealings with other factions of Unionism are
                over. Unionism is coming together at the grassroots and is
                beginning to exercise its strength, and he had better realise
                that it is not the type of Unionism that runs away. We were told
                that we ran away from talks. We did not. We said that we would
                not be there when the gunmen came into the talks.
                Mr&nbsp;McCartney’s party said the same thing. We kept to our
                mandate. We would have been dishonest if we had not done that.
                We did not run away.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On this crucial day, when the voice of united
                Unionism should have been heard, the main Unionist party is not
                here because Mr&nbsp;Trimble is attempting to hold on to office.
                That is what this is about — people who are prepared to sell
                their souls for office. I am not in that business. I have always
                been prepared to put my beliefs in my manifesto. People have
                hated and cursed me for that and have said that it is terrible,
                but I have always been honest. I have said what they will get if
                they vote for me.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today I say to the House that we all have to
                heed the ballot box. Gerry&nbsp;Adams is not prepared to do that
                because the ballot box in this country declares clearly that the
                people do not want those involved in violence in the Government
                of Northern&nbsp;Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have a list of the people who have been
                murdered in the past year. Who murdered them? The IRA. It will
                take more than Bertie&nbsp;Ahern’s wriggling to tell the
                people of Northern Ireland that the IRA is different from
                Sinn&nbsp;Féin. They are the same. I am not the only one to say
                that; both parties in the United&nbsp;Kingdom Parliament have
                preached using the words &quot;inextricably linked&quot; from
                the Front Benches.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When they were told to look up the word
                &quot;inextricably&quot; they said that they did not want to do
                so. It means that the organisations are one and the same. Indeed
                they are one and the same. When Mr&nbsp;Adams looks at his beard
                in the morning — not to shave, but to check that he has washed
                it properly — he says to himself &quot;Am I Gerry&nbsp;Adams,
                the leader of the IRA, or am I Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Féin?
                I am going to the Assembly today, so I must be the leader of
                Sinn Féin.&quot; Or he might say &quot;I am going to south
                Armagh today, so I must be the leader of the IRA.&quot; They are
                one and the same thing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The people of Northern Ireland gave their
                verdict a few days ago. They said that they would not tolerate
                having people who are associated with paramilitary
                organisations, and who are carrying out these murders, in the
                Government of Northern Ireland. IRA/Sinn Féin is the only such
                organisation which, under this legislation, is in a position to
                enter the Government. Those Unionists who did not run away have
                today been able to derail this whole process, to bury it in a
                Sadducee’s grave, from which there can be no resurrection.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was very insulting for the Secretary of
                State to call this meeting and run the d’Hondt system today.
                It was also insulting for the Government to say that they would
                delay the legislation at Westminster, while pushing this process
                through here. Did the SDLP and Sinn Féin really think that they
                could push it through? It is a farce. It is no wonder that the
                Member for South Down refused to take part by accepting a
                nomination. Then his colleague resigned as Deputy First Minister
                (Designate). Why did we have to go through this farce? We had
                people being congratulated and applauded on their appointment to
                ministerial posts which they were to hold for only 10 or
                15&nbsp;minutes. What will the people of Northern&nbsp;Ireland
                think of the House today? Everyone will know that we were
                engaged in a farce.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Irish Republican Army has continued to
                kill with impunity. Mr&nbsp;Farren, who is very eloquent on the
                subject of Dunloy but not so eloquent when his constituents are
                beaten up by the IRA, will be interested to know of an attack
                which took place a few days ago. Having beaten up a man, the IRA
                wrecked his car and his house, before going to his son’s house
                and attacking him as well. On their way home they broke the
                windows in the Free Presbyterian church. This is the sort of
                violence we can expect from IRA/Sinn Féin and which we are
                asked to put up with.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the last 12&nbsp;months there have been
                46&nbsp;shootings and 119&nbsp;beatings and mutilations. These
                attacks were carried out not by Loyalists — who have attacked
                people, and whom I condemn utterly — but by the IRA. In west
                Belfast there have been 22&nbsp;shootings and 27&nbsp;beatings;
                in east Belfast, four&nbsp;shootings and 25&nbsp;beatings; in
                north Belfast, five&nbsp;shootings and 24&nbsp;beatings; in
                south Belfast, two&nbsp;shootings and 12&nbsp;beatings; in
                Armagh, four&nbsp;shootings and 10&nbsp;beatings; in Strabane,
                no shootings but 11&nbsp;beatings; in Londonderry,
                five&nbsp;shootings and four&nbsp;beatings; in Dungannon, no
                shootings but two&nbsp;beatings; in Cookstown, one&nbsp;shooting
                and two&nbsp;beatings; in Lisnaskea, one&nbsp;shooting and
                one&nbsp;beating; in Downpatrick, one&nbsp;shooting and
                one&nbsp;beating; and a man was shot in England.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today has been a good day for Northern
                Ireland. Democracy has triumphed. There are no IRA men in the
                Government of Northern Ireland.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Neeson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First of all, I pay tribute to the Deputy
                First Minister (Designate). I have always believed him to be an
                honourable man, and during the course of the last year he has
                carried out his duties with great honour. Sadly, I cannot say
                the same of those colleagues who are absent, or to those who,
                with their jibes and sneers during Mr Mallon’s speech, did no
                honour to the Assembly today. Unlike Dr&nbsp;Paisley, I think
                this is a very sad day for the Assembly and for the people of
                Northern Ireland, particularly the 72% who last year voted
                &quot;Yes&quot; for the Good Friday Agreement. Those people who
                came out in such numbers to vote in favour of the agreement must
                feel betrayed by the absence of the Ulster Unionists from this
                Chamber today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Good Friday Agreement is not dead. My
                party is totally committed to that accord, which we signed last
                year. I recognise that because of today’s events it is now
                inevitable that we will go into review, but the important thing,
                as far as I am concerned, is that the agreement is still alive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In recent months we have attempted to move
                this process forward to honour the wishes of the vast majority
                of people in Northern Ireland and to create a power-sharing
                devolved Government. The Ulster Unionists jumped at the
                opportunity of signing the Hillsborough declaration, which, in
                fact, committed paramilitaries to token decommissioning. I
                believe that the joint statement, ‘The Way Forward’, made by
                the two Governments at Castle Buildings gave much stronger
                commitments, not only in relation to devolution but also with
                regard to the very thorny issue of decommissioning. I cannot
                comprehend why the Ulster Unionists could jump at the
                Hillsborough declaration but could not find a way to accept ‘The
                Way Forward’. It is essential that the pro-agreement parties
                stick together to ensure that the process moves forward. It can,
                if we all act collectively.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The former Deputy First Minister (Designate)
                referred to the meeting on 1&nbsp;July last year. I firmly
                believe — and I am sure many colleagues in this Chamber today
                agree — that we should have moved then to establish the
                Executive, to set up the various Committees and to appoint
                Chairpersons, Deputy Chairpersons, and so forth. The failure to
                do so has created the problems we now face.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I regret that we missed the deadlines in July
                and October. We had a golden opportunity to move the process
                forward in the interests of all the people of
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland by implementing ‘The Way Forward’. One
                thing that concerns me greatly is that we are now creating a
                political vacuum. We all know that a political vacuum will allow
                dissidents on all sides to undermine the democratic process.
                Even in my constituency of East Antrim there have been a huge
                number of sectarian attacks in recent months. I believe that
                people who are opposed to the Good Friday Agreement will try to
                fill the vacuum that has been created.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are in great danger of losing the
                international goodwill that has been created since the signing
                of the Good Friday Agreement. I am quite sure that
                Tony&nbsp;Blair and Bertie&nbsp;Ahern are fed up with the
                shenanigans of recent weeks. There is a serious danger of our
                losing goodwill, not only in the British&nbsp;Isles but also on
                the international scene.</p>

                today sit on the IRA’s army council and have been directly
                involved. The message that goes round the world today should not

                the future of the people they had terrorised; and we were
                opposed to the mass release of terrorist criminals and to
                terrorists retaining weapons while the RUC was to be demoralised
                and disarmed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not opposed to peace, stability and
                reconciliation, but, as we said when we addressed the people at
                the time of the referendum, the agreement offers no hope of
                peace, no end to violence and no likelihood of political
                stability. I ask people to measure our position today against
                that prediction of what the Belfast Agreement would or would not
                deliver.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us begin to see the end of the
                undemocratic structures of the Belfast Agreement. Let us clear
                the site and start to build upon the foundations to enable us to
                offer the people of Northern Ireland an accountable, clear and
                transparent form of government. Perhaps in the future we can
                return to this Chamber and start the process of offering the
                people of Northern Ireland what they are entitled to and what
                they deserve.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today — and perhaps this will be the last
                sitting of the Assembly — it is noteworthy that in other parts
                of the United Kingdom democracy goes on. Scotland and Wales were
                not faced with a choice between having terrorists in government
                and having no government. Because of that, democracy continues
                in their Chambers, and Members are permitted to look after the
                interests of their electorates. I trust that, having seen the
                end of an undemocratic proposition, those who are committed to
                solely peaceful means will come together to achieve democratic
                government for the people of Northern Ireland.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the outset I must apologise on behalf of
                Mr&nbsp;Denis&nbsp;Watson. Unfortunately his daughter has been
                taken ill, which is why he is not in the Chamber.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This debate seems to have arisen out of the
                comments by the recently resigned Deputy First Minister. He made
                some allegations as to where people on this side of the fence
                are coming from and where we stand. One of the significant
                things about the debate is that those of us who were elected on
                a &quot;No&quot; ticket have stood united throughout all of
                this. Our position has not altered in any way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are still opposed to psychopathic serial
                killers sitting in the Government of our country, and that
                position will not alter. Those guilty of Teebane, La&nbsp;Mon,
                &quot;bloody Friday&quot; — the leader of Provisional
                Sinn&nbsp;Féin knows all about &quot;bloody Friday&quot; in
                Belfast and what happened then — have blood on their hands.
                For that reason this is a good day for democracy. We will not
                have those people sitting in the Government of this land.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has been said that 72% of the people were
                in favour of the agreement. That is absolute nonsense. Anyone
                who makes such a comment is not living in the real world.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We all know now without a shadow of doubt
                that the vast majority of Unionist people are totally opposed to
                the agreement. They are also totally opposed to Provisional
                Sinn&nbsp;Féin’s being in the Government of our land and to
                the treaties that are being put in place. It is very clear that
                the debate is not all about decommissioning or about preventing
                Catholics from coming into government. It is nauseating to hear
                members of the Provisional IRA in this Chamber accusing some of
                us of being anti-Catholic and of not wanting Catholics in
                government. It is slander — a deliberate and blatant lie by
                people who have based their whole campaign on lies. Republicans
                are very good at creating a lie and then building a case on it.
                How many people have been killed over the past year? Three have
                been killed and there have been 160&nbsp;beatings at the hands
                of the Provos in this so-called peace period. Peace may be the
                cry, but where this crowd is concerned war is the reality.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Decommissioning is not the only issue. We all
                know that, once in government and with the treaties in place,
                they would be quite happy to pull the plug on the Assembly. What
                will happen when the plug is pulled? The North/South bodies will
                still be there, still functioning, and we will have joint
                authority. That is one of my reasons for being totally opposed
                to the agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Decommissioning has become a red herring. It
                is said that if we get rid of it everything will be hunky-dory
                and we can all sit down together and have a cosy arrangement. Of
                course, that will not be the case, for other issues have been
                forgotten. I know where I am coming from. I know where the
                people whom I represent are coming from, and I know their
                position. They do not want me to have anything to do with those
                who, by bomb and bullet, have tried to bring down this state and
                to undermine the credibility of the security forces, the
                Government and elected representatives, all in furtherance of a
                satanic end.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I know where I am coming from. I also know
                where this crowd is coming from. For that reason I am totally
                opposed to those aspects of the agreement that cover such
                matters as treaties. As we go forward, I remember how the last
                Assembly finished. The Speaker read a prorogation Order at about
                3.00&nbsp;pm, and we stayed until after midnight and were led
                out or carried out by members of the RUC. Peter&nbsp;Robinson
                spoke for seven or eight&nbsp;hours, and we all respected his
                great stamina, power and authority.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I intend to speak not for seven or eight
                hours but for seven or eight&nbsp;minutes — and I will have
                trouble doing that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I repeat that a realignment of Unionism is
                taking place. It is not being created but is evolving. A flame
                has been lit across this Province that will see the new Unionism
                evolve and eclipse these people for ever.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ervine:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am disappointed with many things but
                especially with Seamus&nbsp;Mallon’s resignation. I may not
                agree with everything that he believes in or says, but he is a
                man of integrity, political skill and ability. I am frightened
                and worried about the consequences of his resignation. It cannot
                be taken in isolation; it must be taken in the context of empty
                Benches, no executive authority in this society and the death of
                the Good Friday Agreement. I do not like to contradict my
                colleague, but I say &quot;You have won; we have the death of
                the Good Friday Agreement.&quot;</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us look at what that means. It means that
                the rest of the United Kingdom will have devolution and we will
                not. The rest of the United Kingdom has also suffered, whether
                through violence or through the consistent propping-up of this
                place in military terms. The people there have spent billions
                and have carried their boys home in body bags — boys who were
                trying to protect this society and give people an opportunity to
                find a way to the future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The British Government have even less hair
                than I have, for they have been pulling it out for years
                wondering how the people of Northern Ireland might make a fist
                of the future. We have answered loudly and clearly that we are
                not able, not mature enough, to take on the responsibility of
                accountable democracy. It is dreadful that the governance of
                Northern Ireland by the people of Northern Ireland may not be
                possible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Agnew says that a flame has been lit
                across Northern&nbsp;Ireland and that we are seeing a
                realignment. I am deeply disappointed at that, not because I
                will not be part of the flame but because of the damage that it
                will do to our relationships with the rest of the United
                Kingdom. Folk there will point to the fact that of the
                56&nbsp;million people in the United Kingdom the Unionist
                community accounts for 900,000. Having accepted that the Good
                Friday Agreement is dead, you throw out with it the principle of
                consent for Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The people of the United Kingdom, in
                perfectly correct democratic circumstances, might wish to have a
                direct say in the affairs of Northern Ireland. Many people on
                the mainland understand the difficulties in Northern Ireland,
                but they are vastly outnumbered by those who do not. We blame
                them for not understanding, but the skill and powers of oratory
                of our leaders have never quite managed to explain the problem.
                We rant and rave, and as I stand here worried and fearful for
                the future, the guffawing and the enjoyment of some are obscene
                in the extreme.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The world has been watching the debacle that
                is the Parliament of Northern Ireland. All of us should take
                heed of what the world thinks. We can no longer live in our
                little parochial society; we can no longer shout at the window
                and hope that the big bogeyman will go away. Governments no
                longer have friends; they have interests, and when their
                interests are damaged they will make decisions that damage
                others.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope never to be in a position to say
                &quot;I told you so&quot;, but I feel certain that I will. The
                Unionist community is committing political suicide for very
                narrow and base reasons. It is not because it cannot countenance
                change, for the majority of the absentees can countenance
                change. As I have said before in this House, decommissioning was
                never an issue between Unionism and Nationalism. It was an issue
                within Unionism — a battle for hearts and minds, taking people
                absolutely nowhere. Those involved have succeeded, and there is
                no doubt that the consequences will be severe. And I have not
                even mentioned the potential for violence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We live in what has been a violent society,
                though some Members believe that we live in a normal society
                where one can do normal things. In an abnormal society, in the
                creation of which every one of you is complicit — some perhaps
                less than others but complicit nevertheless — you might accept
                that you sometimes have to do abnormal things to try to create
                circumstances of normality. You are refusing to do that because
                you are the grand democrats.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The will of 72% of the people — actually
                71·12%, but a substantial and serious majority — has today
                been stood on its head. The sneering grand democrats who do no
                wrong, the saintly people who have no complicity in the pain of
                an abnormal society, have stood democracy on its head. The
                71·12% stated what they wanted, but the grand democrats would
                not have it. It did not mean that you could not have your view
                or your opinion, but you have agitated, tried to frighten people
                and hyped the circumstances out of all proportion. And you have
                succeeded. <i>[Interruption]</p>

                realise that that is the wrong way to go.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The people of Northern Ireland have to find
                some way to live together. They must find a way to share this
                earth. The pain, sorrow and tragedy have affected us all, and we
                must find a way of ensuring that our children and our children’s
                children will not do this all over again. None of that will be
                easy to achieve, but it will be a hell of a lot easier without
                an Anglo-Irish Agreement Mk II to further pollute and alienate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, I want to pay tribute to Seamus&nbsp;Mallon.
                If there is another opportunity his skill, ability and talent
                will be used for the benefit of the people of Northern Ireland
                — provided that there is somebody sensible within Unionism to
                harness them and to ensure that there are no extremes.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I too should like to pay tribute to our
                Deputy First Minister (Designate). He said that he had tried and
                tried and tried again and that this process had been bled dry.
                On many occasions some of us felt that he too had been bled dry.
                His face often matched that white hair as we tried over and over
                and over again to make this work. He never stopped, and I hope
                that, despite his resignation, he will not give up. As he
                travelled around the countryside he probably saw that the peace
                process was ahead of the political process. It is up to us to
                try to make the two go in tandem. I hope that he will be able to
                walk that road with us and that one day we will be back here
                with an opportunity to vote him into office again.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Like many others in Northern Ireland, I am
                sad today. Some people, who have not even paid us the courtesy
                of turning up to give us their views, are determined to exclude
                others, but in doing so they have excluded us all.
                Dr&nbsp;Paisley said that the strength of Unionism was rising
                again. That is not the kind of country that we want to live in
                or could live in — a country in which only one community has
                the strength. Nationalism could say the same, as could
                Republicanism and Loyalism, about the strength of its community.
                Whatever else we did on Good Friday, we recognised the diversity
                of the communities, not the strength of one community over
                another. If that is the voice of celebration, it is a very sad
                voice to hear in this Chamber. Where will the slogan &quot;Not
                an inch for peace, not an inch for political compromise&quot;
                lead us?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is sad that at last night’s meeting it
                took only 15&nbsp;minutes to decide to throw out the declaration
                &quot;The Way Forward&quot;. That was just one minute for each
                month that it has taken us to implement the agreement. We knew
                that implementation would be as hard as the work that went into
                making it. Some are arguing today that it is over, but we cannot
                let that bring us down.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Too often it was said that the anti-agreement
                people would win. If some wallow in the demonisation of others
                and in scurrilous comments such as have flown across this
                Chamber today, and if that is what passes for a celebration of
                bringing this agreement down, God help those who believe in the
                power of politics.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I did believe in politics. That is why, after
                the agreement and the referendum, we stood for election. We
                wanted to give the people something new.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What have the Ulster Unionists said
                &quot;No&quot; to? They have said &quot;No&quot; to the majority
                of people recognising the constitutional status of Northern
                Ireland. They have said &quot;No&quot; to the recognition of
                citizens’ allegiances — their Britishness and their
                Irishness — and to their entitlement to a democratic devolved
                Government in Northern Ireland. Most of all, they have said
                &quot;No&quot; to the consent of the people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We never had an opportunity before to ask the
                people of Northern&nbsp;Ireland how they would like to be
                governed. We did that last year. Look at what we have done
                today. When are we going to give difference its due? Whatever
                else the Deputy First Minister (Designate) did, he told us not
                to be wedded to the old state of affairs in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland, but to try to build a society in which we
                could be reconciled with each other. We still have to do that,
                and it will be an uphill struggle.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have much hard work to do. We heard this
                morning — and Mr&nbsp;Ervine has reiterated it — that we
                must have a review. Can anyone imagine what that will be like? I
                heard people in the corridor saying &quot;Review? We will give
                them a review.&quot; This is what the Good Friday Agreement
                overcame: a determination to have only one’s own position put
                forward. That will not work in Northern&nbsp;Ireland. This will
                be the most difficult review we ever had.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has been said too often that we will never
                be able to put the pieces together again in the way we did on
                Good Friday. We shall have to try. As leader of the Women’s
                Coalition, I have often said that when sleeping women awake,
                mountains will move. We certainly have a hell of a lot of
                mountains to move. All I ask is that the Deputy First Minister
                (Designate) continue to help us move them.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was with a touch of sadness that I heard
                of Seamus&nbsp;Mallon’s resignation. There are many things in
                politics that he and I do not share and many things on which we
                are in profound disagreement, but I take no personal joy in his
                resignation. He will be aware that if I had been responsible for
                the negotiation of an agreement with him and his colleagues it
                would have been very different from the Belfast Agreement. I
                think he also knows that whatever I had entered into I would
                have honoured.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I feel insulted by the patronising and
                high-flown lectures about our futures and our children’s
                futures that we have had today from the leaders of Sinn Féin
                and the PUP, both of which are inextricably linked with
                terrorist organisations that have inflicted murder and mayhem on
                both sections of the people of Northern Ireland. Each has been
                responsible not only for inflicting suffering on the other
                community but in many cases for inflicting even greater coercion
                and violence on members of its own.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I take no lessons about democracy from such
                people. I believe in democracy and in pluralism. I have no
                problem whatever, as I have said on more than one occasion in
                this Chamber, about sharing power or responsibility, equality or
                human rights with Catholics — Fenians, if you like —
                Republicans or Nationalists. But, as a democrat, I have profound
                disgust at the thought of sharing power with people who do not
                know the meaning of the word &quot;democracy&quot;.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Good Friday Agreement, as, sadly, it is
                called by many people — the Belfast Agreement, to give it its
                proper title — was founded on a fraud. It was a fraud against
                both communities, for its obscurantist language was deliberately
                designed to make both believe that it encapsulated their
                objectives. Nationalists and Republicans were, I believe, led to
                think that the agreement imposed on them only a duty to use
                whatever influence they might have on paramilitary and terrorist
                organisations to deliver decommissioning by
                22&nbsp;May&nbsp;2000. I believe in strict terms, and I have
                said before in the Assembly that the agreement did not impose on
                parties connected with terrorist organisations a condition that
                those organisations should decommission by that date.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Such a condition was imposed by a far greater
                and higher authority — by the very fundamental principles of
                democracy and of democratic procedure. Nowhere in the democratic
                world was there such a Caliban, such a Frankenstein, such a
                monster, as the process that was designed to govern the people
                of Northern&nbsp;Ireland, for it would have permitted those who
                are inextricably linked with armed terrorists to take their
                places in a Government which was alleged to be democratic but
                which could, at any time, by the use or threat of violence,
                impose the wishes of a minority upon a majority.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over the past three years I have found it
                very difficult not to respond when greeted in friendly terms by
                name — surname and Christian name — by members of political
                parties inextricably linked with terrorist organisations. Though
                it seems unnatural and discourteous, I do not respond, because I
                see absolutely no difference between Sinn&nbsp;Féin and the IRA
                and absolutely no difference between David&nbsp;Ervine’s party
                and the UVF. Both have inflicted the most disgusting crimes on
                society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will be happy at any time to engage in the
                democratic process with anyone, even if he has — and possibly
                continues to have — blood on his hands, but only if I am
                assured that he has given up violence permanently and completely
                and believes in the principles of democracy. When people were
                asked to give proof of their new-found democracy it was missing.
                Why? In a democracy a minority party must persuade the
                electorate to make it a majority party if it wishes to exercise
                power. But if a minority party can never persuade the electorate
                to make it a majority party, what does it do? <i>[Interruption] </i>No,
                you go out and get a gun or a bomb, and you threaten.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I listened to Mr&nbsp;Adams patronising
                Unionists with lofty sentiments about democracy in the future
                and about our children. This is the man who was commander of the
                Belfast&nbsp;brigade of the IRA on
                &quot;bloody&nbsp;Friday&quot;. This is the man who now presents
                himself as a kind, fatherly and thoughtful democrat. I listened
                with equal disgust to Mr&nbsp;Ervine as he strung together a
                collection of sound bites with the facility of a trained parrot.
                He told us what would happen in the streets. He postured and
                used all the guile of the advocate. To tell us what? Perhaps he
                was telling us that he is no longer associated with the UVF. He
                advises them politically. And there was the latent threat that
                people who know that they now have no Belfast Agreement might
                just have to resort to other things, that they may escape from
                his control, that they may continue to do all the violent,
                wicked and absolutely horrible things that the UVF has been
                doing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I draw absolutely no distinction between
                terrorists. There are no such things as Republican terrorists
                and Loyalist terrorists, good terrorists within the agreement or
                bad terrorists outside it. There are only terrorists, and
                terrorists use violence, murder and bombings to achieve what
                they cannot achieve through the democratic process. Yet we have
                Mr&nbsp;Ervine and Mr&nbsp;Adams patronising those who have no
                bombs and no guns and who have never killed anyone. I was not
                mentioned by Mr&nbsp;Adams because in absolutely no
                circumstances do I measure up to any of the things of which he
                accused others. I have never carried bombs or associated with
                paramilitaries of any kind, whether Orange, Green, Republican or
                Loyalist — never.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I believe in pluralism and democracy, and
                while there are guns in the possession of people who are
                inextricably linked to political parties they cannot be included
                in a democratic Government. That is where I differ from Seamus.
                He believes that you can let them in for a little while. I
                believe that trying to house-train fascists gives a poor return,
                as Gen&nbsp;von&nbsp;Schleicher and von&nbsp;Papen and all of
                those who thought that they would bring the National Socialists
                into government discovered in 1934. We are not about to
                rediscover it in Ulster in 1999.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr&nbsp;Paisley questioned whether I was
                following a somewhat unusual practice, and I confess that there
                is some truth in what he said. When the personal statement was
                being delivered by the former Deputy First Minister (Designate)
                I received a notification from the Secretary of State. However,
                as your Presiding Officer, I felt that its terms foreclosed on
                an opportunity for leaders of the parties to comment on what I
                believed was more than simply a personal statement. I therefore
                sought, on your behalf, the leave of the Secretary of State to
                hold back on what she had said until I felt that all the party
                leaders had had an opportunity to speak. I hope that what I did
                was right; it was certainly done with the best of intent.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Secretary of State’s letter reads as
