                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. Why is there
                a table in the Chamber? I always thought that in a voting
                Chamber such as this, no one was allowed to say how a matter
                would be settled. I understand that the table is there because
                Members think that they are going to be able to change their
                position. The table could have been brought in later, if that
                was the decision of the House, rather than jumping to the
                conclusion that this was a rubber-stamp Assembly that would do
                what the powers that be want it to do.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member is wrong. The table is there so
                that if a First Minister and a Deputy First Minister are elected

                Minister are elected, they will be able to come forward, one to
                each side of the table, to take the Pledge of Office. The Member
                was erroneous in thinking that it was related to re-designation.</p>

                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is confusion about the motion, the
                motives of the Women’s Coalition, and the legitimacy of what
                we hope will be the end result. I want to clarify our proposal
                and our reason for making it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion is not about the principle of
                re-designation. Any Member of the Assembly has the right to
                change his or her designation. The rules of the House rightly
                make provision for that. A Member’s ability to change
                designation allows for the art of political persuasion. That is
                what politics is about. If a Unionist, a Nationalist or
                &quot;Other&quot; is persuaded by the political position of his
                or her opposite number, that Member can change designation. That
                is a logical argument. That is normal politics.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our reason for tabling the motion is not that
                we have been persuaded to change our identity. The cross-
                community nature of our electorate enables us to do that. Some
                DUP Members have described that as &quot;political
                cross-dressing&quot;. The accurate description is
                &quot;cross-community&quot;. It is unfortunate that people
                cannot recognise that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are a coalition of Unionists, Nationalists
                and &quot;Others&quot;. We draw our membership and our votes
                from all three designations. We have never claimed to be a party
                of the centre. We do not attempt to persuade one another of the
                merits of our different cultural, political, religious and
                constitutional beliefs. We attempt to understand and respect one
                another’s differences, listen to one another, and learn from
                one another. We first signed the Roll in the Chamber as
                Unionist/ Nationalist/Other. When that designation was not
                accepted we agreed to designate as &quot;Inclusive Other&quot;.
                We want to change that designation in order to be consistent
                with the diversity of our coalition. If the motion is passed, my
                Colleague Monica McWilliams will re-designate as Nationalist,
                and I will re-designate as Unionist.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That does not mean that we are joining new
                political parties. We remain the Women’s Coalition. It is a
                means of expressing the diverse, cross-community identity of our
                party. I have explained that the issue of re-designation itself
                is not up for debate this morning. The motion concerns the
                timing of such a move, and it is not only about its immediate
                effect but the amount of time that we recommend should elapse
                before any other change would be considered.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The choice to change designation can often
                depend on a change in the political context. The speed of that
                change, as we all know very well, is totally unpredictable. The
                timing of this change is crucial, not only because of the
                looming end of the six-week deadline for the Assembly but as a
                response to the highly significant events of the last 10 days. I
                refer specifically to the move by the IRA to decommission its
                weapons. We could not have predicted 30 days ago that the IRA
                would make such a momentous move and that David Trimble would
                put his Ministers back into Government. — <i>[Interruption]</i>.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. I am finding it difficult to hear the
                Member.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thirty days ago we could not have predicted
                that we would be facing one of the most crucial votes in the
                Assembly. If we had known that the IRA was about to do what we
                had been asking of it for years, we might have expected very
                little opposition. Perhaps we should have known better.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If, as a result of today’s vote, we do not
                respond positively to these events and do not get ourselves out
                of this political limbo and restore stable power-sharing
                government to Northern Ireland, we will give the opponents of
                decommissioning the opportunity to say &quot;I told you
                so&quot;. This amendment to Standing Orders may appear to be
                procedural, but it is much more than that. It is about making
                our votes count. It is ironic to think that our votes will not
                count if the motion does not pass. Our votes have no value
                otherwise. The motion provides an opportunity for us all to
                change designation. I urge others to take that opportunity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Women’s Coalition got into politics to
                make a difference. Our voters will not allow us to sit on our
                hands and allow the Assembly to fall apart, and neither will the
                people who supported the Good Friday Agreement.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">About four or five years ago several
                politicians from Northern Ireland went to South Africa, among
                them the leader-in-waiting of the SDLP and myself. During that
                trip many of us found that one of the valuable mechanisms
                employed in the process in South Africa was the concept of
                sufficient consensus. We came back during the early part of the
                &quot;talks about talks&quot;, which later became the talks
                themselves, and expounded on the virtue of ensuring that in a
                divided society a mechanism was in place to secure support from
                both sections of the community for whatever major decisions were
                to be taken.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That was enshrined in the rules through a
                fairly elaborate formula in the talks process. Since then it has
                found its way into our Standing Orders in a formula that is
                still elaborate, though less so. It is now known as
                &quot;designation&quot;. The principle behind it is that in a
                divided society, whether we like it or not, it is not sufficient
                to carry the support of only one section of the community. We
                Unionists found that out to our cost during the period of the
                old Stormont Parliament. Unionists were happy with the
                institutions and would have been happy for them to go on.
                Nationalists, however, were not happy, and the institutions
                fell. Nationalists would have been content for the power-sharing
                Executive to continue. Unionists were not content, and they
                brought it down. It was recognised that there needed to be
                widespread support. That was the virtue that was enshrined in
                the Belfast Agreement, the Northern Ireland Act 1998, and
                Standing Orders.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.45 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The reality for society in Northern Ireland,
                whether or not people voted for the Belfast Agreement, was that
                a safeguard was placed in that agreement. It appears in strand
                one and 2, under the heading &quot;Safeguards&quot;. That is
                where the issue of designation appears. It is a safeguard for
                both communities. No key decision can be made unless there is
                the support of both sections of the community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore it seems strange that some Members
                who say that they are here to save the Belfast Agreement want to
                break it. The only permissible and valid reason for
                re-designation would be if someone genuinely wished to become
                either a Unionist or a Nationalist.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Neither the Belfast Agreement or the Northern
                Ireland Act 1998 make any reference to re-designation. However,
                the Assembly — and the Committee set up by the Assembly —
                recognised that such a situation might arise. Therefore the
                Assembly provided for a change of designation. When that
                decision was taken, it must have been known that some
                unprincipled Members might attempt to use this mechanism to
                achieve a result different from that intended by the
                legislation. The Assembly must have known that Members might
                attempt, for convenience, or for some spurious reason, to change
                their designation to affect an outcome.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For that reason two qualifications were set
                down in Standing Orders. One was that 30 days had to pass. This
                meant that a Member could not decide one day to change
                designation and impact on the outcome of a vote; a period had to
                elapse. That was the safeguard against such abuse. The second
                qualification was that the re-designation had to remain in place
                for the life of the Assembly. This meant that if re-designation
                were not being sought for a genuine reason, a Member would have
                to think twice about it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The purpose of the motion is to set aside
                those safeguards. The Women’s Coalition wants to set them
                aside because the proposed re-designation of its two Members is
                not based on a genuine reason. Re-designation is not being
                sought because Monica McWilliams wants to be a Nationalist and
                Jane Morrice wants to be a Unionist. I can say that with
                certainty because they said so publicly. This week, they said
                that their re-designation would be for the &quot;sole aim&quot;
                — no other alternatives — of saving the agreement. It was
                not being sought because they had genuinely changed their
                designation; it was being sought for the &quot;sole&quot;
                political purpose of saving the agreement. It is abundantly
                clear that the Women’s Coalition’s reason for re-designation
                is not valid according to Standing Orders, the Northern Ireland
                Act 1998, or the Belfast Agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some Members might say that this suits them,
                although it is not in line with what was intended. However,
                think of the mischief that could be caused if this
                re-designation is permitted to take place. That is why I tabled
                my amendment. It further removes the temptation for Members to
                use re-designation for a spurious and false purpose. My
                amendment extends to beyond six weeks the time frame in which to
                give notice, a period that might, in some people’s minds, be a
                useful interval for re-designation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The bottom line for the Assembly is that if
                this re-designation is permitted, what is there to stop a bunch
                of Unionists from either party, after an election perhaps, from
                re-designating themselves for a moment as Nationalists? What if
                Sinn Féin got its nose in front of the SDLP and thought that
                one of its members was going to become Deputy First Minister?
                What would happen — a re-designation, some sidestepping, some
                sleight of hand?</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The SDLP will support the motion to amend
                Standing Orders. I listened with interest to Peter Robinson. It
                is important to emphasise that he supported the concept of
                re-designation from the outset, as indeed did the DUP. Mr
                Robinson referred to his visit to South Africa, from where the
                concept emerged. There is, therefore, no principled opposition
                to the motion by the DUP. It is opposing the motion for party
                political reasons. Standing Orders clearly permit this
                procedure, and if the motion is carried, the Women’s Coalition
                will be exercising a right enshrined in them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Robinson said that there are safeguards in
                the procedure for re-designation. A fundamental safeguard is
                that Standing Orders can only be changed with cross- community
                support. Cross-community support is the real safeguard. If the
                Assembly decides, on the basis of cross-community support, that
                re-designation is a proper course of action, the change will be
                made. The proposition by the Women’s Coalition is not an
                unprincipled one. It is being made for a good purpose, for a
                valid reason, as explained by the representative of the Women’s
                Coalition, a party which is making an important and constructive
                contribution to the Assembly and to sustaining the agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We all know the circumstances that gave rise
                to the motion. We are in a grave situation which calls for
                supportive action. The fate of the Assembly and the agreement
                should not be permitted to be in the hands of those least
                committed to the agreement. People should not be held to ransom
                by two quixotic Members. Is it not more credible that the Women’s
                Coalition should use its position to bolster the Assembly, which
                has done much constructive work for the community, and the
                agreement, which 71% of the people of Northern Ireland support?
                The DUP owes its places in the Assembly to that agreement, and
                some members of the DUP are secretly wishing that the situation
                would pass by and they could retain their positions here.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Should the future of the agreement and the
                Assembly be in the hands of maverick Members? The motion — <i>[Interruption]</i>.</p>

                quite arbitrary — the time period.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is the essence of the motion. If Members
                wish to re-designate, they should not be held back by the
                artificial constrictions of an arbitrary time period. That is
                precisely what the proposed amendment to Standing Orders does.
                It does not change the nature of re-designation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The SDLP supports the motion. It is in the
                interests of all the people of Northern Ireland who voted for
                the agreement. I invite Members to support it.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Weir:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I find myself in an unusual position in this
                debate, for two reasons. First, ironically, it would appear that
                I am the first and, possibly, the only Ulster Unionist Party
                member to speak in this debate. Secondly, and more importantly,
                I find myself defending the Belfast Agreement on this issue,
                possibly for the first and only time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My position on the agreement has always been
                clear. Whether designation in the House was on the basis of
                Unionist, Nationalist or &quot;Other&quot;, or on the basis of
                yes, no or John Taylor, I made it clear from day one that I did
                not regard the agreement as the best way forward. However, I am
                the only opponent of the agreement in the Chamber who was
                present on the first and last days of the talks, and I was a
                member of the Standing Orders Committee — which I freely admit
                as crimes to be taken into consideration.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must examine the purpose of the clause in
                the agreement that relates to the designation of Unionists and
                Nationalists. It is no secret that, during the talks, Unionists
                took the view that they did not want people to be pigeonholed as
                Unionist, Nationalist or &quot;Other&quot;. We felt that there
                was a danger that it would institutionalise sectarianism, and
                that it would lead to problems such as those experienced in
                Cyprus — which have been highlighted by Prof Anthony Alcock
                — where the designation of people in groups led to a
                double-veto situation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, as a result of strong pressure in
                the talks, the clause was agreed with the aim of creating a
                situation in which the interests of Unionists and Nationalists
                — not only in the Executive but on the Floor of the House —
                were protected by rights. The aim was that, if there were a
                vote, Unionists and Nationalists would genuinely have to support
                any measure of a cross- community nature. If that is the case
                — and it has been enshrined in the rules of the Assembly, it
                has worked to the detriment of Unionists at times and it has
                been there since day one — we tamper with it at our peril.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For example, if we allow instant
                re-designation, we could find ourselves in the situation where
                28 Unionists re-designate themselves as Nationalists for a
                particular vote. That would constitute the necessary 40% of
                Nationalist support for any motion. However, that would clearly
                be a farce. It would drive a coach and horses through the rules
                and the intentions of the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are gathered here today for the serious
                purpose of electing a First Minister. I agree with remarks by
                David Trimble and others that the vote for First Minister should
                be based on the genuine wishes of the Unionist and Nationalist
                Members. There must be no sleight of hand. The key test is
                whether we will authorise sleight of hand. No matter how much
                the Women’s Coalition portrays itself as a coalition of
                Unionists, Nationalists and &quot;Others&quot;, it is not —</p>

                to Unionism. As Mr Kennedy said yesterday, one cannot become a

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There must be some integrity in the
                proceedings. If the Members from the Women’s Coalition are
                allowed to call themselves Unionist or Nationalist simply to get
                a particular vote through, not only will the terms of the
                agreement be abrogated but, more importantly, the Assembly will
                be turned into a farce and a circus. I urge Members to have the
                integrity to stand by their designations and ensure that

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On behalf of my party, I support the motion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are a number of safeguards in Standing
                Orders which have been approved by all parties and Members.
                Standing Orders have also been changed on a number of occasions.
                The principle of re-designation is not in question — the
                purpose of the motion is to enable re-designation to come into
                effect immediately. Some Members have suggested that this would
                mean that Members could re-designate after every meeting, every
                vote or every week. That is not the case. The change is designed
                to amend the Standing Order for an entire session, which I
                believe is a calendar year. The amendment to Standing Orders is
                not designed to enable any Member to re-designate willy-nilly.
                That is not the case at all.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some Members, Peter Robinson included,
                mentioned various technicalities. It is fair to do that because
                Standing Orders are designed to ensure that business is run
                properly. Members are at liberty to change Standing Orders if
                they wish. Cross-community support is needed to secure any such
                changes, that is one of the safeguards.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Peter Robinson talked about South Africa and
                the need for sufficient consensus. However, South African logic
                resolved conflict through inclusion — not exclusion, which is
                what the DUP has been solely and exclusively about all of its
                political life. I do not see that party changing, no matter how
                its Members designate. It is important that Members such as
                Peter Robinson and the public who must listen to him realise
                that his amendment is about the politics of exclusion, not the
                politics of inclusion. Inclusion was at the core of conflict
                resolution in South Africa, and the principle of inclusion was
                recognised by over 70% of people across this island in the
                referenda that followed the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After this vote, it will be seen that almost
                80 Members will have voted to make the necessary change to save
                the agreement. That is what the motion is designed to do. That
                shows that there are a number of parties, participants and
                elements in society who support a peace process and the
                agreement and who are prepared to make giant strides to save
                them. There are others, some of whom are in the Chamber today,
                who are bent on ensuring that the Good Friday Agreement and the
                peace process go down. Those people will be able to wallow in
                their anti-agreement, exclusive politics of the past. Whether or
                not an election is forced is not a matter for this debate. If
                there is an election, then so be it. The electorate will decide
                that the negative Members in the Chamber who base their lives on
                exclusion are from the DUP with, perhaps, Rag, Tag and Bobtail
                alongside them.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is well established that the concept of
                designation has caused great problems for my Colleagues and me
                ever since it was introduced in the discussions that led to the
                agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We made some of those concerns known when
                Standing Orders were discussed in autumn 1998. We did not accept
                an easy change of designation. Designations do not solve the
                problems of our divided society. The concept of designations as
                it exists must be removed, and tinkering with 30 days or 45 days
                or one minute does nothing to address the problem. We should
                examine why designations are problematic. We should ask those
                people who devised the system whether it is what is needed. We
                should ask those who supported the minute whether they are proud
                that what they agreed in March 1998 was incorporated into the
                Belfast Agreement on 10 April.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion — however well intentioned —
                does not address the fundamental issue. Peter Robinson referred
                to the South African experience and the need for sufficient
                consent. Clearly that is important. However, we must ask whether
                tinkering with Standing Orders addresses appropriately the
                problem of sufficient consent and whether having a very narrow
                majority in Unionism or Nationalism is an appropriate way to
                stop proceedings that are supported elsewhere in the House.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If Peter Weir were to go on record as
                supporting the agreement, I would be prepared to go on record as
                supporting him — at least in a sentence or two. He made an
                interesting point when he referred to the Unionist concern that
                designations entrench sectarianism and divisions. My party will
                not support designations and it will seek a more fundamental
                review. According to the current rules, there must be a majority
                of Unionists and of Nationalists to elect a First Minister and a
                Deputy First Minister. The candidate for First Minister wishes
                that to be a majority of &quot;genuine&quot; Unionists, and he
                can rest assured that we will not disrupt his concerns in that
                regard. We will not &quot;dress up for Hallowe’en&quot; as one
                Member described it. We will allow him to seek his majority
                among genuine Unionists, because the rule stating that our votes
                count for considerably less than those of others is
                fundamentally sick and wrong. Not only is that an insult to the
                five Alliance Members, it is also an insult to the many
                thousands who voted in May 1998 for non-sectarian politics. On
                their behalf, we will take no part in this charade of tinkering
                with Standing Orders. We will continue to work for proper
                change, to lobby Government and to make it clear that we do not
                accept that our society is divided into two tribes and that
                there is no coming and going between them. We do not accept that
                those who wish to stand outside the &quot;two tribes&quot;
                mentality do not have rights. Those who support us have exactly
                the same right as everyone else to have their voice heard in the
                Chamber.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The attempt by the Women’s Coalition to
                change Standing Orders to permit instant re-designation by any
                Member is no more than a cynical exploitation and abuse of the
                procedures of the House. It is an attempt to subvert and thwart
                the will of the majority of the Unionist community as
                represented by this side of the House.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Women’s Coalition has revealed that the
                true purpose of the motion is to secure the reappointment of Mr
                David Trimble as First Minister.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is worth reiterating several points on
                which the opposition of the wider Unionist community is based.
                If the Assembly falls today, Mr Martin McGuinness would like it
                portrayed internationally that the message from Unionists and
                from those he calls &quot;rejectionist&quot; is that they do not
                want a Roman Catholic about the place. That is not the case.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is opposition in the community to Mr
                Trimble’s reappointment and the consequent establishment of an
                Executive. He and his Colleagues are well aware of that
                opposition. Mr Trimble knows that he does not have a broad base
                of support within his own party. He knows that the Unionist
                community has the mandate to state clearly what it rejects and
                opposes in today’s motion and Mr Trimble’s reappointment.
                The majority of Unionists in Northern Ireland say that they are
                opposed to the release of unrepentant terrorists; they are
                opposed to gunmen who front parties that are inextricably linked
                to terrorist organisations being placed in Government; and they
                are opposed to the destruction of the RUC.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is well known that the Unionist community
                is unhappy with the prospect of Mr Trimble resuming his post of
                First Minister, thus parachuting back into position those who
                continue to front terrorism in Northern Ireland. Members such as
                Mr McGuinness wish to portray themselves as representatives of
                the Catholic community. Many Roman Catholics and Nationalists
                have as much difficulty as I do with Sinn Féin representatives
                masquerading as democrats who are supposed to subscribe
                completely to the democratic process. Thinking of people such as
                Patsy Gillespie, Mrs Jean McConville, and the other missing
                victims, I throw back in the Sinn Féin/IRA representatives’
                faces their assumptions that they represent the decent Catholic
                community, or the law-abiding members of the Nationalist
                community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When Unionists, I hope, reject the Women’s
                Coalition’s motion and, therefore, deprive Mr Trimble of his
                reappointment, let us be clear that it is not petty, vindictive
                score-settling against Mr Trimble; it is not an attempt to
                prevent people who genuinely want to re-designate from doing so.
                I make no apology for the message that my party will send out in
                opposing the Women’s Coalition’s motion and Mr Trimble’s
                reappointment — we remain adamantly and vehemently opposed to
                those who front terrorist organisations being in Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remind Mr Trimble, as I told him that I
                would, that, in the Chamber three weeks ago, he said that even
                if the IRA were to hand in a small quantity of weapons for
                decommissioning, that would neither be a demonstration nor a
                guarantee that Sinn Féin was totally committed to the
                democratic process. That is absolutely correct; on behalf of my
                party, I would take the same position if the actions proposed by
                the Women’s Coalition were to put Mr Ervine, and those who
                front the Protestant terrorist organisations, into power. The
                House should send out a clear message today that it will not
                have people in Government who are linked to terrorists.</p>

                Monica McWilliams a Nationalist at the flick of a switch creates
                all sorts of difficulties and problems for the future.</p>

                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have listened to what are intended to be
                the reasons for supporting the motion. They can all be summed up
                in one sentence: anything is permissible to save the agreement.
                That is their argument, and it is the only one that they have.
                It has nothing to do with the fact that this provision is
                intended to be a safeguard. They are happy to sweep it to the
                side when they choose.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In my earlier remarks, I tried to alert
                people to what they are walking into. The SDLP and Sinn Féin
                have said that they support this easy switch that has been
                proposed by the Women’s Coalition. They support the idea that
                people can re-designate on a whim. To us it is an abuse of
                Standing Orders. However, they want it to be permissible for a
                Standing Order to allow Unionists or Nationalists to move from
                one side to the other in order to pass a provision through the
                Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The purpose of the safeguard was to ensure
                that Unionists and Nationalists would be content. When Members
                walk through the &quot;Ayes&quot; Lobby they will be sweeping
                away that safeguard. A lawyer has suggested the nonsense — and
                I can only guess as to whom his lecturer at law school might
                have been, but they are not in the Chamber to confirm it —
                that the safeguard lies in the requirement for cross-community
                support to change Standing Orders. The very thing they are
                undermining and tearing down is to be the safeguard that it will
                not happen. That seems to be a conundrum with no solution.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second thing we are being told by the
                supporters of the motion is that there is no difference in
                outcome in allowing someone to change designation within 30 days
                or within a day. The clear message is that the Women’s
                Coalition wants to do this for a particular purpose. The reason
                they advocate stopping the period from being the &quot;life of
                the Assembly&quot; is that they intend to switch back before an
                election. They want to be designated as &quot;Other&quot; rather
                than as &quot;Unionist&quot;, or &quot;Nationalist&quot; when
                they face the electorate. That is the reality of the situation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My amendment seeks to cement the original and
                proper intention of the Standing Order, which is to ensure that
                the threshold is raised. The amendment will make it less
                attractive to use the provision for corrupt purposes by people
                wanting to change designation — falsely claiming that they are
                Unionist or Nationalist — in order to affect the outcome of a
                vote. My amendment takes temptation out of their hands by
                raising the threshold.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The sad reality is that once again there is
                an attempt — this time for the prospective First Minister —
                to hang on to the apron strings of the Women’s Coalition in
                order to get himself returned to office. What credibility can
                that have? It can have none. Mr Trimble says there can be none.
                On ‘Inside Politics’ last Saturday he said that
                re-designation by the Women’s Coalition simply would not be
                credible; nor would it be credible on the streets of Northern
                Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Effectively, the agreement is on a life
                support system, kept alive by dishonesty and sleight of hand. We
                have already seen some Unionists being prepared to abandon their
                manifesto commitments and go back on their commitments to the
                electorate in order to keep it going. During the past few years
                we have seen the Deputy First Minister resigning, with all the
                emoluments of office being swept away from him, and then
                suddenly heard that the resignation did not take place. This was
                all done to save the Belfast Agreement and keep it alive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have watched the Secretary of State
                trigger suspensions to restart the clock — again to keep the
                Belfast Agreement alive. Now we have deceitful re-designations
                when there is no change of heart on the part of those who wish
                to re-designate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The truth, which is obvious to everyone who
                has not been hypnotised by this Provo-bolstering process, is
                that the agreement cannot exist without deceit, cheating,
                dishonesty and lies. It is a fraud, and is unacceptable in its
                existing form. That is why the electorate should have the
                opportunity to have its say and the opportunity to see it
                renegotiated.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What we have heard from the parties
                supporting the motion and, interestingly, the party opposing the
                motion, is that they do not have a problem with the Standing
                Order allowing re-designation. Had we not proposed our motion,
                they would never have proposed their amendment. It is the time
                period they have a problem with, not the principle.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If it is the time period that they have a
                problem with, I have to remind Mr Morrow, the former Minister
                for Social Development, that he had a problem with the time
                period contained in a Standing Order. If he had not had such a
                problem, on 15 October he would not have asked the Assembly to
                suspend Standing Order 40(1) in respect of the Final Stage of
                the Social Security Fraud Bill.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On 15 October the DUP did not have a problem
                with the timing when we changed that Standing Order. We have
                amended Standing Orders 12, 31, 41, 59 and 40, which allows a
                Budget Bill to proceed under accelerated passage. That was a
                major amendment to a Standing Order. If there is a problem with
                amending Standing Orders, let that be put to rest now. This is
                not a precedent.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Psychics try to read the minds of members of
                the Women’s Coalition and the party’s make-up, but we are
                Nationalists, Unionists and &quot;Others&quot;, because of our
                party’s membership and its title, and because we appeal to a
                cross-community electorate. That has been on record since the
                first Assembly sitting.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us remind ourselves of who changed the
                Standing Order — none other than Mr Weir, the same Mr Weir who
                supports parts of the agreement. He supported the part that
                allows amendments to be made, and he wanted to change from seven
                days to 30 days. He does not have a problem with re-designation;
                he simply had a problem with the 30 days and wanted to change it
                to seven days. Today he has a problem with changing it from
                seven days to &quot;an Assembly session&quot;.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">John F Kennedy said &quot;Ich bin ein
                Berliner&quot; when he visited Berlin. He was very confident
                about his identity, as all Americans seem to be, and he had no
                problem on that day, in that crisis, with standing alongside the
                Berliners. His statement meant &quot;I am with you&quot;, and we
                are saying today &quot;We are with you&quot;. We are with the
                majority of the Assembly. If today’s vote were counted on a
                majority basis, it would go through, and the Assembly would have
                a First Minister and a Deputy First Minister in place by the end
                of the day.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let me also remind Peter Robinson that I,
                too, visited South Africa while he was on his second visit
                there, along with Sinn Féin, before any ceasefire and before
                decommissioning. He was trying to understand the concept of
                sufficiency of consensus at a time when the DUP did not attend
                any meetings. The DUP changed the rules on that occasion, and he
                went on that visit.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We brought sufficiency of consensus to the
                Assembly, and the sufficiency of consensus referred to during
                the talks was different from that which exists in the Assembly
                today. From the talks came the triple-lock mechanism —
                majority of parties, cross-community consensus and majority of
                the entire number around the table. <i>[Interruption]</i>.</p>

                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before we commence, I wish to explain how I
                propose to conduct proceedings. As Members will know, there is
                no procedure set down in Standing Orders, although a procedure
                was set down in the Initial Standing Orders. I discussed the
                matter through the usual channels, and it was agreed that we
                would follow that same procedure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will begin by asking for nominations.
                Members are reminded that under section 16(2) of the Northern
                Ireland Act 1998, for a proposal to be valid, it must include
                nominations for both First Minister and Deputy First Minister. I
                will then ask for the proposal to be seconded, as required by
                Standing Order 14. Each nominee will then be asked if he or she
                is prepared to accept the nomination. I will then proceed to
                seek further nominations. If further proposals are made, the
                process will be repeated until there are no further nominations.
                At that point the House may, if it chooses, debate the
                proposals. I propose to conduct one debate on any and all
                proposals that are made, and no Member will be permitted to
                speak more than once, as the Initial Standing Orders provide.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall then put the question that the first
                pair of nominees be the First Minister and Deputy First Minister
                of the Assembly. Under section 16(3) of the Northern Ireland Act
                1998, the vote will require the support of a majority of the
                Members voting in the election, a majority of the designated
                Nationalists voting and a majority of the designated Unionists
                voting.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Should the proposal be carried, I will ask
                those Members chosen to be First Minister and Deputy First
                Minister to affirm to the Assembly the Pledge of Office. As
                mentioned earlier, the Pledge of Office will be placed on the
                Table, and I will ask those voted through to come forward. If
                the motion is carried and both Members affirm the Pledge of
                Office, I will deem the other proposals to have fallen,
                irrespective of whether they have been put to the Assembly for
                decision. If the proposal is not carried, I shall put the
                question in relation to the next pair of nominees and so on as
                necessary until all nominations are exhausted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The following times for the debate will
                apply. The debate will last no longer than one hour. Each
                proposer and seconder will be permitted to speak for up to seven
                minutes and other Members will have a maximum of five minutes.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Are there any further proposals?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As there are no further proposals, the time
                for proposals has passed. Several Members have indicated that
                they wish to speak, and I remind them that they may speak only
                once in the debate.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Normally, we would have expected this debate
                to be of a more technical nature. However, the Assembly has
                become a crucible for the political frustrations of many
                Members, representing their communities’ frustration at the
                inability to advance the process at the speed that we would have
                liked.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since the beginning of the process, those of
                us on these Benches have sought the full implementation of all
                parts of the agreement. That was what we were promised after the
                agreement was made in 1998. The then Secretary of State,
                Marjorie Mowlam, indicated that all parts of the agreement
                should proceed in parallel. Hitherto, that has not been the
                case. However, as a result of activity on the part of the
                Republican movement last week, this is the first time since
                April 1998 that all parts of the agreement have been
                implemented. It is important to state clearly on the record that
                this is the first time that all aspects of the agreement have
                proceeded according to plan.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With the stability that we believe should be
                afforded to the Assembly and to the political process, we want
                to proceed towards the elections due in May 2003. In the next 18
                months we want the opportunity to show that the Assembly can
                deliver for the people that it represents. We believe that
                stability can be spread out into the community, and we want it
                to be given the opportunity to flourish.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Instability damages Northern Ireland; it
                damages our economy. After the events in the United States in
                September, the economy of Northern Ireland needs the stability,
                direction and leadership that can be provided in the Chamber. I
                do not believe that our economy and businesses and the jobs of
                the people that we represent will be better served by a direct
                rule Minister — no matter how well intentioned that person
                might be. It requires local knowledge, local effort and
                attention, and, in the relatively short time that the
                Administration has existed, we have proved that we are capable
                of delivering those things.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I return to the frustrations that are felt by
                some Members and by a large section of the Unionist community.
                Last week, we had good news from the de Chastelain commission.
                However, the contrast between the way in which that news was
                imparted and the way in which other parts of the arrangements
                that were entered into last week were revealed caused much
                anger.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For example, the de Chastelain commission,
                for reasons that I understand, decided — in the interests of
                securing the implementation of its mandate — that it was best
                to confirm that the process of decommissioning had commenced
                without giving the details that we all crave. That was its
                judgement. On the other hand, a film set was created in south
                Armagh. One almost expected Francis Ford Coppola or Steven
                Spielberg to appear behind the towers shouting
                &quot;Action&quot; when members of the press were flown into the
                area to witness the angle-grinding scene. The purpose of that
                exercise was to reinforce the confidence of a particular part of
                the community. However, the emphasis on that, against the
                relative obscurity of the decommissioning process, created a
                tension — <i>[Interruption]</i>.</p>
                <b>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Total obscurity.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was not total. That tension caused
                frustrations. However, my party and I believe that
                decommissioning has commenced. That is to be welcomed. It is a
                breakthrough and something that many Members, not far from where
                I am standing, never believed would be possible. We want to
                proceed now and get it completed, and we also want to get other
                people to start doing what they should have done three and a
                half years ago.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should not allow our scepticism to plunge
                our Province into another political crisis that will have a
                significant impact. I do not believe that events on the streets
                are totally unrelated to events in the Assembly. We are supposed
                to be setting an example. From time to time, that has clearly
                not been happening.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After three and a half years of very hard
                work, we have achieved the set objectives of devolution and the
                commencement of decommissioning. We must bear in mind what our
                fellow citizens in the rest of the United Kingdom will think if,
                after reaching those objectives, we suddenly decide to plunge
                ourselves into a crisis. It does not profit any Unionist to make
                Northern Ireland appear ungovernable — that only benefits
                Republicanism, and it has been clear for some time that
                Republicans have already anticipated that opportunity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However frustrated one may be about the lack
                of progress hitherto or the fact that the process is not as open
                as one would like it to be, that is not sufficient justification
                for creating a crisis and plunging us into a further period of
                uncertainty and instability. It is my contention that this
                motion should be allowed to proceed. The election of the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister would provide stability
                and be the centre of our Administration. It would give the
                Assembly the opportunity to fulfil its mandate. We will then all
                answer to the people for the work that we have done. At this
                stage — at the very point where we are making a breakthrough
                — it would be very foolhardy to shy away from that. I commend
                the motion to the House.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Mallon:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is my very real pleasure to second the
                nomination of David Trimble as First Minister and Mark Durkan as
                Deputy First Minister. They each have personal strengths that
                will serve them well in the joint office of the First Minister
                and the Deputy First Minister.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I particularly welcome the fact that David
                Trimble is seeking re-election to the post of First Minister at
                a time when all the institutions provided for in the agreement
                can work to their full potential. I thank him for his courtesy
                and diligence during the time we worked together. He has not had
                an easy time politically. I wish him well, both as leader of the
                Ulster Unionist Party and as First Minister.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have known Mark Durkan for a number of
                years — I will not specify how many. He has gained respect
                from all parts of the Chamber as Minister of Finance and
                Personnel. The Assembly can have every confidence in his
                ability, his personal integrity and his capacity to perform with
                distinction as Deputy First Minister. In many ways, he is the
                standard-bearer for a new younger generation in the Assembly and
                the community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is an old saying that two into one do
                not go, but, as ever, there are exceptions. Those elected to
                serve as First Minister and Deputy First Minister occupy a joint
                office. They rely on each other to make progress. They work
                together or not at all. It is a challenge that must be met if
                the vision of the Good Friday Agreement is to be fulfilled. I
                have every confidence that David Trimble and Mark Durkan will be
                able to fulfil that vision.</p>

                — there may be another period of apprenticeship. I thank Reg

                the putting of arms beyond use and towards further
                demilitarisation. I particularly welcome the recent report of
                the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning
                which represented the removal of a major obstacle to the full
                implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. Combined with the
                progress made across all elements of the agreement, that gives
                rise to the hope, belief and conviction that the better future
                offered by the agreement will be realised. I have no doubt that
                the vast majority of people want the new dispensation to work,
                and it will work whether the next step is taken today or in the
                future. Society wants to move forward on the basis of
                partnership, equality and mutual respect. The agreement provides
                the means to achieve a peaceful society which offers a future
                for all. As President of the United States, Woodrow Wilson,
                said:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;It must be a peace without victory.
                Only a peace between equals can last, a peace the very principle
                of which is equality and a common participation in a common
                benefit.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those words are as relevant today as they
                were when they were first spoken, and their relevance will grow
                as this process progresses. However, to grasp that opportunity
                we need stable and fully operational political institutions.
                Those institutions need strong, inclusive leadership, but they
                also need a respect for politics and an end to the game-playing,
                the foolishness and the ego-tripping. They need an end to the
                sham approach of taking part, with all its advantages, while at
                the same time publicly undermining the institutions. That is not
                leadership.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In many ways, leadership is a dull thing. It
                is about having the integrity to move on a position based on
                respect for the political process and for all of those in it. It
                is my belief that DavidTrimble and MarkDurkan — different
                people in many ways — are the right people jointly to lead the
                institutions and the people of the North of Ireland towards that
                new peace and stability. I beg to second.</p>

                sit in an Executive with Sinn Féin we require a declaration
                that the ‘war’ is over, the standing down of ‘active
                service units’, the handing over of the remains of the ‘disappeared’,
                full co-operation with the Decommissioning Commission, an end to
                targeting and punishment beatings and actual disarmament
                itself.&quot;</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All that has not happened, and those are the
                words of Mr Trimble, spoken on 26 May 1998. Sir Reg Empey, who
                proposed him, said on 30 August 1998 that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;an IRA arms handover would not be
                enough to give Sinn Féin seats on the Executive. If punishment
                beatings are continuing, if training, targeting, if units are
                still active on the ground, then the purposes of decommissioning
                would purely be fraudulent.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are asked to believe the spin doctors and
                the rigged polls in the ‘Belfast Telegraph’, and to bow to
                past pressures and not open our eyes. The people — both
                Protestant and Roman Catholic — have opened their eyes. They
                have been told to look at what the Official Unionist Party has
                brought to them. Mr Trimble boasts of what he has brought to us.
                What has he brought? He has brought IRA/Sinn Féin to the heart
                of Government. Today, we heard that the leader of IRA/Sinn Féin
                is raising money for firemen and their families in America. What
                about the firemen and families that it murdered, blew up and
                shot? What hypocrisy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The deputy leader of that party said that, if
                someone came to him and said that he or she had information that
                would lead to people being prosecuted for the Omagh tragedy, he
                would not tell that person to go to the police. In America, the
                leader of IRA/Sinn Féin said that the IRA has a different
                morality to that of the people who blew up the towers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The people of Northern Ireland are not fools;
                they will not be fooled any longer. We must remember, &quot;you
                cannot fool all of the people all of the time&quot;. Sooner or
                later, the matter must come to the country. We were told that
                cross-border bodies that are not answerable to the Assembly
                would not be formed — that has happened. We were told that
                terrorists who were put away by the process of the law could not
                be released, but killers and others have been. The Prime
                Minister wrote graffiti on the walls and tried to deceive the
                people of this country. The RUC has been destroyed. Think about
                those people who, under the shadow of night, took the badge of
                the RUC from outside its headquarters before the specified time.
                What more is there to come?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have seen the British Government spend
                thousands of pounds to fly in propagandists to take photographs
                of the dismantling of security towers. No photographs have been
                taken of the so-called act of decommissioning. Why not? Surely,
                if it is an honourable, ground-breaking move, IRA/Sinn Féin
                should be proud of it. They are not. An amnesty is now proposed
                for those on the run. Such proposals have nothing to do with the
                agreement; they are additions to it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Changes to the Police (Northern Ireland) Act
                2000 have been suggested. It was unfortunate that, when Mr
                Mallon spoke about them, he quoted Woodrow Wilson, who, after
                making that statement, was thrown out of office. That is some
                comfort for Mr Trimble today. Mr Mandelson told us that the Act
                would not be changed.</p>

                Peter Robinson bring up the subject of the trip to South Africa
                that I went on several years ago. There was a technical debate
                on cross-community support and sufficient consensus. However,
                Peter Robinson conveniently ignored the fact that the South
                African peace process was successful because it was an inclusive
                process and because there were people of courage in South Africa
                who wanted to end the hatred and division of the past. We are on
                that journey. The Middle East is also on that journey. South
                Africa is ahead of us, and we are ahead of the Middle East. We
                intend to continue to move forward.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am very pleased to give my vote and my
                party’s vote to David Trimble and Mark Durkan as First
                Minister and Deputy First Minister. We owe a debt of gratitude
                to the former Deputy First Minister, Séamus Mallon. He was a
                highly esteemed and respected Deputy First Minister, who made a
                wonderful contribution to the peace process. We thank him very
                much for that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the past decade we have been on a journey
                which has presented genuine difficulties for all sides. However,
                the process is about building a new future for all of us and for
                our children. The process ensures that the past does not become
                the future. That presents a challenge for everyone —
                Republicans, Nationalists, Unionists and Loyalists. This is an
                inclusive process, and everyone shares responsibilities,
                decision-making and accountability. The politics of exclusion
                belong in the past. We can make this work by building and
                bedding down the institutions. We must fulfil the mandate given
                to us by our electorate — the overwhelming majority of the
                electorate. No one said that this would be easy.</p>

                difficulties for Irish Republicans. Republicans will have great
                difficulty dealing with this, but political leaders have a
                collective responsibility to grasp the opportunity that we were
                given last week and use it to best effect for the collective
                good of society. These institutions are not the preserve of one
                party or, indeed, of all the parties. These are the people’s
                institutions. We have a contract with the electorate to work for
                the people and deliver what all the people want. We have a
                mandate to resolve a long-standing conflict. We have
                accomplished much, and we have much more to accomplish. We have
                made progress despite the odds. The institutions are working;
                they are popular and successful. They also allow us to work
                collectively.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am pleased that, although the process has
                been difficult from the beginning, we are seeing the

                the SDLP, Sinn Féin, the Women’s Coalition, the Alliance
                Party and the PUP are coming together. The people who are
                outnumbered are those who live in the past — the tiny number
                of Assembly Members who live in the past. No matter what happens
                today, we will continue to make progress. I was disappointed
                that Peter Weir and Pauline Armitage were not prepared to talk
                with me so that I could attempt to allay their fears. However,

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On behalf of my Colleagues, I support the
                proposal for the nomination of Mr Trimble and Mr Durkan, just as
                we did three years ago when it was proposed that Mr Trimble and
                Mr Mallon take the offices of First Minister and Deputy First
                Minister.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, I thank Séamus Mallon for all that he
                has done during his time as Deputy First Minister. That is
                certainly not to say that the Alliance Party agrees with
                everything that he has done — we have had several exchanges
                with him in the Chamber. However, he held an important office,
                which he took on at a difficult time, and he contributed to the
                best of his ability. It is appropriate that that should be
                recognised in the Chamber today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would also like to thank Reg Empey — whom
                I trust is nearing the end of his short-term apprenticeship —
                for what he has done in recent weeks in conjunction with Séamus
                Mallon.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was a democratic mandate in the votes
                that returned all of us to the Assembly on the ticket of an
                Ulster Unionist and an SDLP member taking on these roles. It is
                tragic that although over 70% of us will vote for that ticket
                today, the arcane rules will deny an election. If the vote of
                70% of the Chamber is not carried because of one or two votes
                within Unionism, I have no doubt that some people will put the
                blame on the Alliance Party. In July 1998 the Alliance Party
                cast five votes within its &quot;Centre&quot; designation for an
                Ulster Unionist/ SDLP ticket. We will do exactly the same today.
                Let us be quite clear about where the blame and the fault lie.
                It does not lie with those of us who have been consistent, have
                supported the institutions and have sought to make the Assembly
                work. The blame will lie with those who were elected as Ulster
                Unionists but who failed to support their leader. The fault will
                lie with a voting system that prevents such a majority from
                carrying the vote.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We do not need a short-term fix. However, we
                must look urgently at the rules to ensure that the will of the
                people, as carried out by their mandated, elected
                representatives, can be effective regardless of the way in which
                the current difficulties have arisen. If the vote does not pass
                today, it is not the end of the road, because a great deal has
                been achieved and much progress has been made, even recently.
                Regardless of the criticisms of individual decisions, there is a
                popular will that the Assembly should succeed and that the
                institutions should function. I might criticise the Executive’s
                achievements so far — and I trust that I will have the
                opportunity to continue to criticise them in a constructive way
                — but there is no doubt that what the Executive have achieved
                to date is better than achievements under direct rule and
                previous Administrations. We are not trying to protect David
                Trimble. Whether he wants our protection is another matter. We
                want to use our votes and influence to protect the agreement, to
                secure the institutions and to ensure that progress continues to
                be made. That is the scenario that all of us will face when the
                vote is taken. However, a better alternative would be for those
                who were elected as Ulster Unionists to cast their vote for an
                Ulster Unionist leader and to ensure that the motion is passed
                by a majority and that it is also in accordance with the arcane
                rules that we are forced to abide by.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The truly momentous decision that will be
                made today will influence the future of Northern Ireland. That
                decision will be made against the dark backdrop not only of what
                happened in America on 11 September but of the events in
                Northern Ireland throughout 30 years of terrorism. There are two
                simple reasons that that parallel is not inappropriate. There is
                no distinction between the evil intent that drove the planes
                into the twin towers and that behind what has happened in
                Northern Ireland. The evil intent that firebombed the twin
                towers is precisely the same evil intent that placed firebombs
                in the La Mon House Hotel.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The terrorism that took place in Northern
                Ireland had no legitimacy, and I say that regardless of the
                attempts that are being made to distinguish the so-called
                freedom fighters of the Republican movement from those who
                killed so many people in the United States on 11 September. That
                is another reason that there is nothing inappropriate in running
                those two things together as the dark backdrop against which we
                make this decision. What happened in Northern Ireland was devoid
                of legitimacy, for the simple reason that no citizens in
                Northern Ireland were ever denied their freedom. A child could
                demolish the logic of the arguments that have been put forward
                in an attempt to legitimise their pursuit of terrorism.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the Assembly decides in favour of the
                appointment of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister,
                we will do more than blur the distinction between terrorism and
                democracy: we will legitimise and elevate terrorism and debase
                and corrupt democracy. We will lay the foundation for a
                criminalisation of our society, already a major problem. That
                will be detrimental to the future of our society. First, the
                representatives of terrorism have been placed in Government.
                Secondly, terrorist prisoners were released because they were
                affiliated to an organisation on ceasefire — a ceasefire that
                could not be broken even by multiple murder or any other form of
                criminality. Now there is to be an amnesty for those who have so
                far escaped the courts. Furthermore, we have had the destruction
                of the police force that stood between the law-abiding citizen
                and the terrorist. That is the elevation and legitimisation of
                terrorism, the crowning act of which took place recently,
                involving Mr de Chastelain. What happened was not the
                decommissioning of a murderous arsenal in such a way as to
                represent a renunciation of violence, it was a recognition by
                two sovereign Governments —<i> [Interruption]</i>.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was no authentic renunciation of
                violence or anything that could remotely be construed as such.
                It was a recognition by two sovereign Governments of the right
                of an illegal and criminal organisation to hold onto its arms
                and, if needs be, to dispose of them at its will. In other
                words, it was a legitimisation of the holding of a terrorist
                arsenal.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the motion is successful, we will have the
                elevation of terrorism and the debasement of democracy. It is
                not only those who are committed to Unionism who must resist
                that; anyone who represents the decency that still exists in
                Northern Ireland must vote to prevent it.</p>

                we have come, not just in the past few weeks, but in the past
                few years. In the Chamber, we often forget that. On 10 April
                1998, we declared our intention to do something different for
                Northern Ireland.</p>

                one of those 254, including myself, had served indeterminate
                sentences, which means that they were life sentences.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There were many milestones during the process
                that led up to the talks, including the release and return of
                prisoners between Christmas and the new year. It was difficult,
                but we should remember that it was difficult for the victims
                too. If we do return the First Minister and the Deputy First
                Minister, we should remember the sacrifice and hurt that they
                have experienced. In the acrimony of parliamentary debates their
                suffering is sometimes forgotten.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nonetheless, we did bring a dynamic of
                creativity to the process, and during the past few weeks that
                dynamic has been restored. There have been some important
                events, and they have been as good as Good Friday. Peace
                building all over the world depends on the introduction of
                dynamics at the least expected moment, and given those events,
                we should be ashamed of ourselves if we do not bring Northern
                Ireland out of the limbo that it has been in since 1 July 2001.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I express my gratitude to Sir Reg Empey for
                filling the position since 1 July, but Northern Ireland needs a
                First Minister and a Deputy First Minister. There will be
                acrimony if we do not elect them today, and we have seen enough
                of that in the past. It is time to return consensus government
                to Northern Ireland. It has worked; it will work; and it must
                work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is time also to pledge our intention to
                work with the coalition Government. It is unique and
                unprecedented, but so is Northern Ireland. People concentrate on
                bad behaviour, on poor and disastrous events of the past, on the
                wrong behaviour that we witness too often in our streets,
                villages and communities. Only the leadership of the Assembly
                can create the necessary framework to change that. We have done
                our best today, and we expect other parties to play their parts
                as well.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am glad that we have this opportunity to
                support the nomination of Mr Trimble, and I welcome the
                nomination of Mark Durkan as Deputy First Minister. I am sure
                that he too will bring a wonderful voice of leadership to the
                community, because he is known to speak with the voice of
                consensus. I support the nominations.</p>

                have listened to Reg Empey talk about the difference between the
                publicity given to the events in south Armagh and the secrecy
                that surrounds the alleged act of decommissioning last week. We
                should also remember the speech that the Republic’s Foreign
                Minister, Mr Cowen, gave in New York on Tuesday.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He said that the British Government must move
                speedily to remove the hardware of war from south Armagh and
                from west Tyrone to show people that politics worked. As far as
                I am aware, no listening device or observation post has ever
                brought about the death of anyone, but Kalashnikovs,
                surface-to-air missiles and Semtex have.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That shows the hypocrisy not only of those
                comparisons but of Reg Empey’s attempt to persuade the
                Assembly and the people of Northern Ireland that what happened
                last week amounted to an act of decommissioning that they could
                accept. That party would accept anything — literally anything
                — to stay in office, to have their cars and emoluments, to
                posture that they are doing something under devolved government
                that has not been done before. What is the state of the Health
                Service? What is the state of the economy of Northern Ireland?
                What is the state of transport? All of them are worse now than
                they were before.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Séamus Mallon — that avowed democrat —
                should know all about the procedures of democracy that were
                distorted and disfigured by his mock resignation and that have
                been further defiled by what has happened here today concerning
                re-designation. Mr Martin McGuinness prattled on about
                decommissioning. Mr McGuinness, Mr Adams and Mr Pat Doherty
                undoubtedly consulted their fellow members of the IRA Army
                Council, Mr Keenan, Mr Ferris, &quot;Slab&quot; Murphy and
                others, to decide what they should do. They represented to the
                world that they were distant from the people to whom they were
                talking.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Monica McWilliams prattled on about
                consensus. She said that we must have consensus — as she and
                her Colleague Jane Morrice were attempting to undermine, as
                Peter Robinson so graphically pointed out, the very fundamentals
                of consensus and cross-community approval that were the alleged
                linchpins of the agreement. Martin McGuinness said that there
                was no pressure to exclude parties. I have never exerted
                pressure to exclude democratic parties from the Assembly. But I
                am opposed to members of the IRA Army Council being in charge of
                the education of our children. I am opposed to including

                decommissioning has taken place, no one believes that. The
                arch-appeaser, Mr Trimble, has entered the Chamber. Mr Trimble
                told us that 22 May 2000 was the magical date for
                decommissioning; it never happened. Mr Trimble offered to resign
                if decommissioning did not happen by January 2000; it did not
                happen. Mr Trimble was conned in May 2000 by a target date for
                decommissioning of June 2001; it never happened. Mr Trimble, Sir
                Reg Empey and their party have been conned into believing that
                decommissioning will occur as a result of the events of last
                week. Even Gen de Chastelain confirmed that this was a one-off
                event; there was no suggestion of any continuum. We have reached
                the stage where the gombeens of Ulster Unionism will literally
