    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  First, I will say a few words about what I expect for debates in the Chamber  and about the nature of them, for the benefit of all Members who have been  returned to the House. Let me briefly outline what I expect. In line with my  rulings in the last mandate, which Members can look back on, debates should be  conducted with courtesy, good temper and moderation. Members should avoid  personalising remarks to any Member and should be careful to use proper names  when addressing Members and referring to parties. Members will know that I was  very strong on that issue in the House in the last mandate. When Members rise  in their place to address the House, they certainly should not personalise  remarks to any other Member.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Also, when it comes to referring to political parties in  the Chamber, political parties should be known and referred to as what they are  registered as with the Assembly. I do not want Members tagging names on to  political parties in the House. There is no difficulty with expressing  differences of opinion in the House, as long as debates are conducted with  common courtesy and respect. I have said continually in the House that  different debates and issues will raise different emotions among Members, and I  can understand that. However, all of it should be conducted with courtesy, good  temper and moderation. I will leave that with Members.</p>

    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I inform Members that 13 Bills have received Royal Assent. The Wildlife and  Natural Environment Act (Northern Ireland)  2011, the Welfare of Animals Act (Northern   Ireland) 2011, the Assembly Members (Independent  Financial Review and Standards) Act (Northern   Ireland) 2011 and the Licensing and Registration of Clubs  (Amendment) Act (Northern    Ireland) 2011 became law on 29 March 2011.

The  Autism Act (Northern Ireland)  2011 became law on 9 May 2011.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I advise Members that the Attorney General for Northern Ireland  has asked the Supreme Court to determine whether clause 3 and clause 4(2) of  the Damages (Asbestos-related Conditions) Bill would be within the legislative  competence of this Assembly. The matter has been listed for consideration by  the Supreme Court on 13 June 2011 to 16 June 2011. That is for information to  the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="a3"></a>Suspension of Standing Order 20(1)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The next item of business is the motion &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. We are shortly to appoint Ministers, including  a Justice Minister. That person will have to work closely with other Ministers,  particularly in relation to legal matters. I ask for your ruling, if not today,  at an appropriate point in the future. My understanding is that a Historical  Enquiries Team investigation into a murder incident some 30 years ago is to begin  this week. If it transpires &mdash; my understanding is that it will &mdash; that the  deputy First Minister&rsquo;s name will be implicated in relation to that  investigation, how would a Justice Minister be expected to work in the context  of a live investigation that was currently going on, until that matter be  dispensed with?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I thank the Member for his point of order. The Member will know that these are  complex issues, so allow me to come back to the Member directly or to the  House. It may be that that is a matter for the Minister and the Minister alone.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That Standing Order 20(1) be suspended for 16 May 2011.</p>

    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The next item of business is the appointment of Ministers.

    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have received correspondence from the First Minister and deputy First  Minister in relation to the appointment of junior Ministers. The letter states:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Pursuant to the procedure for the appointment of  junior Ministers specified in paragraph 3(1) of the determination made by the  then First Minister and deputy First Minister on 8 December 1999, as approved  by the Assembly on 14 December 1999, we have appointed Jonathan Bell MLA and  Martina Anderson MLA as junior Ministers in the Office of the First Minister  and deputy First Minister. A copy of the letter of appointment is attached.&rdquo;</p>

    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Ms Martina Anderson appointed a junior Minister.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  That concludes the business of appointing junior Ministers. Once again, I offer  my congratulations to the junior Ministers on taking up office.</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="a6"></a>Minister of Justice</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I will conduct the process of the filling of the office of Minister of Justice  in accordance with the procedures set out in Part 1A of schedule 4A to the  Northern Ireland Act 1998 and Standing Order 44A. I will begin by asking for  nominations. Any Member may rise and nominate another Member of the Assembly to  hold the office of Minister of Justice. If Members rise from more than one  party, I will call first the Member from the largest of those parties to make a  nomination, which is the convention for other items of business.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I advise Members that the Act requires that one nomination  must be processed before a further nomination can be made. I will, therefore,  take only one nomination at a time and put the Question on that nomination. If  the Assembly resolves by parallel consent that the Member nominated shall be  Minister of Justice and that person takes up office as required by the Act and  Standing Orders, no further nominations may be made. I will call for further  nominations only if those conditions are not fulfilled. I advise the House that  a debate will take place on each nomination. If Members indicate that they wish  to speak, they may do so for up to three minutes. If that is clear, we shall  proceed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Do I have a nomination of a Member to hold the office of  Minister of Justice?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I have  great pleasure in nominating Paul Givan for the position of Minister of  Justice.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Mr Paul Givan has been nominated. Will he accept the nomination?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Givan</strong>: I  accept the nomination, Mr Speaker.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  took great pleasure in proposing the name of my colleague and friend Paul Givan  for the post of Minister of Justice.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some time ago, when the House took on the role of justice,  some naysayers in our society predicted that the sky was about to fall. Indeed,  there were dire predictions of what would happen if responsibility for justice  came to the House. It is clear to everyone, and particularly recently to the  electorate, that those fears have been unfounded.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is a sign of the growing maturity of the House that we  have moved things forward to the extent that, with the occasional exception, no  Member would now oppose the devolution of policing and justice. It is the  opportunity for us to shape our destiny. For many of our constituents, the  issues of law and order and of justice lie at the very heart of our society,  and it is in that spirit of moving things forward that I propose Paul Givan for  the post of Justice Minister.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will give some background. Paul grew up in a family  involved in the Prison Service &mdash; I should say on the right side of the prison  walls. Therefore, he is someone who, it might be said, has been in  apprenticeship for this job for all his life. He is also someone who in public  life has experience of government, serving first as a local councillor and then  as a special adviser to Edwin Poots, who was then Minister of the Environment.  Latterly, as a Member of the Assembly, he has served with distinction on the  Justice Committee. The sort of vision that Paul can bring to the post will  benefit all society.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As a party, one of our key pledges was tougher sentences.  We believe that the criminal needs to be tackled. At times, too many people in  the justice system still get off with too light a sentence. It is important  that we have someone in post who will fight for those issues at the heart of  government, and Paul is well placed to do so. It is a marker of something that  we want to see happen and to which we will come back if we are unsuccessful  today. Should we fail to gain cross-community support, we will not be  obstructive and stand in the way of appointing a Justice Minister. However, I  believe that Paul has demonstrated the experience and ability for the post and  will provide the fresh face at the Department of Justice that can help take  forward society in Northern    Ireland. I am therefore happy to have  proposed Paul Givan.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  Last Friday, at the talks preparing for today, which, I might say, seems to  have gone rather well so far, we put forward a practical proposition to run all  Departments under d&rsquo;Hondt, in the spirit of respecting all mandates and of  connecting or reconnecting the work that we do in this institution to the  people who sent us here. Our best efforts were not reciprocated, and, despite  some other parties seeing merit in our proposals, we find that the Alliance Party  will not concede on policing and justice.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I must say that I am somewhat surprised by the name that  the DUP put forward, but, nevertheless, on behalf of the Ulster Unionists, I  recognise him as someone with whom I have served on the Justice Committee,  where I could see the obvious talents that were there. I like the idea that he  might be a bit more right-wing than some of his colleagues. That having been  said, it may &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order, Members. Allow the Member to continue.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  Members will also have taken on board the cautionary note that Mr Givan&rsquo;s  proposer implanted in the debate, which was, &ldquo;if we are not successful&rdquo;. It may  indeed turn out that, as in the past, intransigence will be rewarded with a  ministerial position, but that remains to be seen. We are where we are today.  We are going through a process that will be repeated in 12 months&rsquo; time, when  we will run d&rsquo;Hondt for all 12 Departments. Therefore, what we are doing now  seems somewhat confusing for the public who may be watching or listening.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Unionists will work this process. We will  recognise the Minister of Justice and the role that he &mdash; it is likely to be a  he &mdash; will have in the Government during the time of his or her office. The  issues that will confront such a Minister will require the guidance and indeed  support of all parties. We will play our role in protecting that Minister  because &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member should draw his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  That Minister will have in his power the lives of all our citizens. Whoever  that is, we will play our part. We wish that Minister well.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  With your permission, Mr Speaker, I will reserve my comments until we get  beyond what I suspect is the stalking horse candidate.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Agnew</strong>: I  am delighted to be in a position to speak today after having been elected by  the people of North Down. I take the opportunity of my maiden speech to thank  all those who put their faith in me to represent them as their MLA &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The debate is about the nomination of a Justice Minister. I appreciate  that the Member may be very anxious to make his maiden speech, but I suggest  that it should not be made during this debate.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Agnew</strong>: No  problem, Mr Speaker. It was seen as a success of the last Assembly that we were  able to devolve policing and justice to Northern Ireland. However, it will  be a failure of this Assembly if we do not agree that, in future, we should  treat the position of Justice Minister like any other. My party has no great  love of d&rsquo;Hondt. However, for as long as other Ministries are appointed by  d&rsquo;Hondt, we believe that the Justice Minister should be appointed in that  manner.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I accept that we are where we are. We all know how we got  here. However, if we are truly to keep Northern Ireland moving forward, we  have to keep our politics moving forward. Treating the Justice Ministry like  any other is part of that process. I wish the new Justice Minister &mdash; whoever  that may be &mdash; the best of luck in their role. However, I hope that, when we  come to review the process by which we appoint the Justice Minister, we will  agree that that portfolio should be treated like any other.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  That concludes the debate. Before we proceed to the Question, I remind the House  that the Northern Ireland Act 1998 requires that the resolution must be passed  by parallel consent.</p>

    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Do I have a nomination for a Member to hold the office of Minister of Justice?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I would like to nominate my colleague Alban Maginness, who is a gentleman of  considerable ability, not only political but legal. He has a considerable  background as a practising barrister of many years and would be eminently  qualified to undertake the position of Minister of Justice.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We believe that it should have been possible &mdash; indeed, it  still is possible &mdash; to have an agreed running of d&rsquo;Hondt. That is the only way  &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: On  a point of order, Mr Speaker. Perhaps you could clarify something. I thought  that the person who had been nominated had to accept that nomination before we  have speeches on the issue. The leader of the SDLP seems to have got ahead of  herself a little bit.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I believe that Ms Ritchie is trying to make the nomination and say what she is  going to say. I will then ask the Member whether he accepts.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  We believe that d&rsquo;Hondt should have been the process for selecting and electing  the Justice Minister. We said that at negotiations the other night, and we  maintain that position. We believe that allocating Ministries to those who do  not have the legitimate democratic entitlement simply serves to undermine  democracy. It is a gross political distortion when two parties &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. I am trying to be careful not to widen this debate. The Member should  speak about the person who has been nominated, not about the process. We have  debated the process and have now moved on to nominations. I remind the whole  House of that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I nominate Mr Maginness, a person who is eminently qualified for the job.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Mr Maginness, do you accept the nomination?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I do.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The nomination is now open for debate, which I remind Members is about the nomination  of the Member, not a wider debate. That debate has already happened in the  Chamber, and it is over. The debate is now about the person who has been  nominated by Ms Ritchie.</p>

    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question accordingly negatived.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Do we have a nomination for a Member to hold the office of Minister of Justice?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: It  is my great honour and privilege to propose my party leader David Ford as  Minister of Justice. At this stage, David Ford is the only person capable of  achieving cross-community support in the Chamber according to the method of  election of the Justice Minister as set out in legislation. Others parties have  had the opportunity to make their nominations, and those nominations have  fallen.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">David Ford brings great attributes to the post of Justice  Minister. Indeed, he is the outgoing Justice Minister and served with great  distinction over the past year. The devolution of justice was a controversial  issue this time a year ago. Today, the devolution of policing and justice is  widely accepted across the community, and David Ford has established the  confidence of all stakeholders and wider society in the performance of his  functions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">David Ford has a strong track record of delivery over the  past year, including an addendum to the Programme for Government in which he  addressed most of the issues. He fulfilled all the requirements set out in the  Hillsborough agreement of February 2010 and passed a long, comprehensive piece  of justice legislation. He has established a clear sense of direction for the  justice system in Northern    Ireland in tackling difficult issues such as  legal aid and prison reform. He secured additional resources for the police in  order to combat the dissident threat, set out a programme for how we better  manage offending and set out a strong, liberal direction in which we can take  justice forward with the central objective of ensuring that we promote  community safety and that the people of Northern Ireland are safe at home, on  the streets and in their work places. He would make an excellent Justice  Minister and can, once again, command the support of the House and the wider  community.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Mr Ford has been nominated. Mr Ford, do you accept the nomination?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>:  Yes, Mr Speaker, I accept nomination.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The nomination will now be open for debate.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  Having appointed, on Thursday and today, something like 15 Ministers without  debate and without a vote, I suppose that we should be grateful for the  opportunity to debate this proposition, although we all see through and know  the charade of the past hour. There were deliberate stalking horse candidates  to bring us to this point, when the two blocs in the House will restore Mr Ford  to his office. He always was a placeman of the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in in the House,  and it is because he has not disappointed them that he will be re-elected  today.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">1.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Ford has, of course, disappointed those who wished to  see a firm hand on the tiller of justice. In many respects he has been the  Minister of escapes. You, Mr Speaker, might think that you have an open-door  policy, but it is nothing compared to Mr Ford&rsquo;s. Mr Ford has lost more  prisoners than I have lost elections. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span> Some might say that that takes some beating.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On the serious issue of dealing with the upsurge in IRA  terrorism, I fear that, in Minister Ford, we have someone who does not really  have a notion of how to face it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The election of Mr Ford, which will inevitably happen  today, also underscores something of the inequity of this House. His election,  courtesy of those who elect him, will deliver an anti-unionist majority on the  Executive. It also achieves the remarkable feat of setting mathematics on its  head, as 16 equals one and eight equals two when it comes to the filling of  Executive places. That, without elaboration, is a commentary on the gross  inequity that lies at the heart of administration in this Province. And so, I  will not be able to lend my support to the re-election of someone to the  no-unionist-need-apply, gerrymandered post of Justice Minister.</p>

    <p class="H4StageHeading">Principal Deputy Speaker</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The next item of business is a motion on a Principal Deputy Speaker. The Business  Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour for this debate. The proposer will  have five minutes in which to propose the motion and five minutes to make a  winding-up speech. All other Members who are called to speak will have three  minutes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly agrees that there shall be a Principal  Deputy Speaker and directs the Committee on Procedures, as its first priority,  to table the necessary amendments to Standing Orders by 6 June 2011.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that the motion will capture the headlines  tomorrow as, obviously, the key bit of business in the Chamber. I believe that  this is a relatively straightforward proposal, so I hope not to detain the  House too long in connection with it. It is a proposal that is grounded in a degree  of common sense. The position is that, although the principle of having a  Principal Deputy Speaker is accepted, the motion essentially sets the ball  rolling to establish the role and, in terms of the detail, tasks the Committee  on Procedures with tabling the necessary amendments by 6 June.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In addition to you, Mr Speaker, we have three Deputy  Speakers who are elected. However, at present, when it comes to either a line  of succession or protocol, there is no indication of who should be the  principal person who should take your place when you are tied up or away,  perhaps on parliamentary business for the Assembly, or when invitations clash,  as happened on one occasion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion sets forth a relatively straightforward and  simple solution and, in effect, sets up a chain of command to a degree that one  of the Deputy Speakers, to be decided by the Assembly, will be the Principal  Deputy Speaker. That person is meant, if you like, to fill in on such  occasions. From that point of view, I do not envisage that the Principal Deputy  Speaker would be given any additional powers. Although that will be a matter on  which the Committee on Procedures will deliberate, it is essentially a protocol  issue. Similarly, I do not believe that this should lead to any additional expenditure  on behalf of the Assembly. Indeed, I do not think that the Assembly would find  favour with that. Therefore, this is, I think, a common sense solution to the  issue, so I am happy to propose it to the House.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  There has not been a great deal of clarity on what we are actually talking  about with this issue. I suppose that the Speaker has two main sets of  functions: first, those that are categorised by the Northern Ireland Act 1998  and in Standing Orders; and, secondly, broadly representational duties. Mr Weir  argued that this would merely clarify protocol. However, one would have to  question how we have survived this long, since 1998, without having a Principal  Deputy Speaker. So, I am not sure that that argument stands up to a great deal  of scrutiny.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">We have issues. This seems to me very much like  part of the carve-up. There will probably not be many surprises as to who the  candidate for Principal Deputy Speaker is. I would be surprised if it turns out  to be John Dallat.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>A Member</strong>: So  would he.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  That is right: he would be even more shocked. We have issues with supporting  the proposal because of &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Certainly. It seems purely about continuing the carve-up.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  thank the Member for giving way. Obviously, his time is very short, so I will  keep this brief. This is done in other jurisdictions. For example, the Mother  of Parliaments has, effectively, a Deputy Speaker who is in a position above  the other Deputy Speakers. If the Ulster Unionists end up opposing this, they  will not be following the same sort of protocol and procedures as apply in the  Mother of Parliaments.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member has an extra minute in which to speak.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I am sure that Mr Weir knows perfectly well that, having got through from 1998  with the arrangements that we have had, particularly in the past term, there  were no occasions when it proved hugely problematic for you, Mr Speaker, or the  three Deputy Speakers. One imagines that the same will apply in this term. You  were elected last Thursday, and there are three Deputy Speakers in post. One  wonders why we need to elevate one slightly above the other two. There is no  logic behind Mr Weir&rsquo;s argument that it should be done just because it happens  in Westminster.  The arrangements are to give confidence to all sides of the House that they  will be recognised. The Speaker has been elected from the largest party in this  Chamber, with the Deputy Speakers coming from the three next largest parties.  That seems to be a sensible way of doing it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Of course, it causes other problems. If the Speaker is not  available, will the Principal Deputy Speaker always represent the Speaker at  certain events? On a royal visit, for example, would the Principal Deputy Speaker  step into the Speaker&rsquo;s role? That will cause problems, whereas the problem  does not arise in the system that we have at the minute of three equal Deputy  Speakers. We could be setting ourselves up for a difficulty that need not  arise. I question the wisdom of going down that road, which is why we oppose  the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  Like John McCallister, the SDLP will resist this. I am afraid, Peter, that I am  not sure of your logic in putting forward the motion, other than that it seems  to be a two-party carve-up, along with the arrangements, as we all know now,  for the rotation of the Speaker in three years and then two. That is the deal  in essence, and it creates a hierarchy of Speakers. People talk about equality  and an island of equals; in this case the mantra is that Deputy Speakers are  equal, but some are more equal than others.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP is concerned that there will be extra layers of  bureaucracy. We do not know, for example, whether it will affect the  independence of the Speaker&rsquo;s role and office. When we sat down on our first  day to elect a Speaker and three Deputy Speakers, it was the case that the  integrity of the office would remain intact. This way now, it clearly will not.  It will leave one Deputy Speaker in a principal role. We may as well not have  the other two Deputy Speakers; John Dallat and Roy Beggs may pack their bags  because, by all accounts, there will be no &mdash; [Interruption.] Maybe some of the  DUP Members are right: they should go ahead and pack their bags, if that is  what they mean.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are concerned that there is a second-class citizenship  now coming into the Deputy Speaker&rsquo;s role. We will resist it now formally in  plenary, and we will resist it when it comes to trying to change Standing  Orders. Although Peter Weir made reference to there being no financial  arrangements, we need to be absolutely clear that the remuneration and any  pension will not change for any principal officer. I will give way if somebody  who supports the motion wants to answer that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We do not need or want this extra layer of bureaucracy, and  we will not support it.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: We  do not have any particular objection at this stage, although perhaps we will  wait to see what happens before 6 June, when we will get a bit more detail.  However, we assume that the role will be unpaid and that there will be no extra  pension benefits, although we wonder whether it will involve extra duties for  the individual who is elected Principal Deputy Speaker. Does it follow that the  Principal Deputy Speaker will have a better chance of becoming Speaker in the  future? It has already been agreed that the Speaker will change in three years&rsquo;  time, and I imagine that the person who is eventually elected as Principal  Deputy Speaker will follow on from you, Mr Speaker. All that said, we have no  objection, but neither would we have brought the matter forward, had we had the  option. It seems to be slightly pointless, but we will reserve judgement.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  I am pleased to speak on this matter, but I should first congratulate those who  have been appointed to their positions today. I feel very sad that I am not the  Justice Minister, despite all the support that I got. I reiterate that that  selection was not right, and here we have a hint or smell of another deal being  done that we do not all know about.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I hoped that, as the Assembly started, consultations and  discussions would include all parties. I know that we have a chance to discuss  it now, but we will not find out exactly what the role is until later. I hoped  that we would see everyone being included at all times, rather than just paying  lip service to the idea. I smell jobs for the boys. We would like to know what  is behind the deal and what is on the other side of it, if, indeed, there is  something on the other side. We have found out that extra things appear all the  time from St Andrews, Hillsborough and,  indeed, maybe from the beginning of this session. We would like to know what is  behind them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have three good Deputy Speakers. They are equal, from  all parties and can do the role just as well. We could follow the line of the  argument about the Mother of Parliaments, but there are more than 600 people  there, and a great deal of different duties and work is needed. I would like a  promise that the role will not be paid more and that there are no extra costs,  rather than finding out later that other costs have come in. In addition, I  would like clarification that, if there were a royal visit or something of that  nature and the Speaker was ill or otherwise indisposed &mdash; not that I would wish  that on you &mdash; someone will be here to look after things. That is the point of  having three Deputy Speakers: the job can be rotated. We need to know a great  deal more. Therefore, the Ulster Unionist Party opposes the proposal, and we  want to know more about what money and deals are behind it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  Last Thursday, when the arrangement was announced that the DUP would keep the  Speaker&rsquo;s seat warm for Sinn F&eacute;in for three years, I predicted that it was part  of a sordid deal. Within an hour, we had the first manifestation of that: this  motion was produced. One thing is abundantly clear: there is no practical,  logical or rational need for the proposition. For the past four years, the  House appears to have functioned, within its limited confines, perfectly  adequately with three co-equal Deputy Speakers. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  Suddenly, we discover that we need a hierarchy of Speakers and we need a  Principal Deputy Speaker. What a slight on the two who will be passed over and  are now here merely to make up the numbers. It is quite clear to me who will  fill the post. Perhaps Mr Weir gave it away when, in the course of giving the  job description, he talked about putting in place a chain of command. I wonder  who that would best suit. It is clear that the position is the outworking of an  arrangement, a totalitarianism that has begun to hallmark the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in  in the House as they share the mantra of &ldquo;ourselves alone&rdquo;; create offices for  themselves; grasp those offices to themselves; and further bring the House into  disrepute by reason of the carve-up of all offices between them. Their  inability to tolerate dissent and an alternative view or give the light of day  to Members of minor parties is indicative of that totalitarian attitude.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">What will be the powers of the Principal Deputy Speaker? Mr  Weir tells us there will be no powers. What is the point then? That is not what  Sinn F&eacute;in told the &lsquo;Belfast Telegraph&rsquo;. Last Friday, a Sinn F&eacute;in spokesman  said:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;It will not be dissimilar to the way it works between  the First and Deputy First Minister&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">What is the truth? Is this a Principal Deputy  Speaker with additional powers? Mr Speaker, will you have to share with him the  rulings you are going to make? Will you have to share your official functions  with him? Will he become joined to you at the hip, as the First Minister is to  the deputy First Minister? Or is Mr Weir right?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Will the Member please draw his remarks to a close?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  I conclude by saying this: the constant elevation of Sinn F&eacute;in by the DUP  within the structures of this House is something that many thought they would  never live to see. Of course, many innocent people, like Eric Lutton, never  did.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I must now insist that the Member brings his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McClarty</strong>:  I do not intend to delay the House longer than is necessary. Everything that  can be said has been said already in the debate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Earlier this afternoon, we all witnessed the farce of  electing the Justice Minister, the outcome of which was going to be nothing  other than that which had already been decided outside the House. The decision  regarding this issue has also been made outside the House. I appeal to the  House not to try to mend something that is not broken. I speak from experience,  having served four years as Deputy Speaker. The Deputy Speakers and the Speaker  met every Monday and Tuesday morning at 9.45 am. We looked at the business for  the day and arranged which Deputy Speaker should take over from Mr Speaker, if  he had other duties to perform that day. That was the right way to go about it  because all the Deputy Speakers were equal. By passing this measure and  allowing it to happen, we will create a hierarchy that was never intended.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I note that the Procedures Committee has to report by 6  June, which is D-Day, Deputy Speaker day. I oppose the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Agnew</strong>: I  have yet to hear a compelling reason for the appointment of a Principal Deputy  Speaker. Nothing in the running of the last Assembly highlighted the need for  such a position, and there is no public demand for it. I see no way in which  the introduction of a position of Principal Deputy Speaker will help the  effective and efficient running of the Assembly. As we have just heard from a  former Deputy Speaker, it is clear that the current system is working fine.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I can only assume that this post is being proposed as a  token gift to the party that takes up the role rather than because of any  specific need. I, for one, think we should have more respect for the  institutions than to give out token positions. If there is a need for it, fine,  but I am yet to be convinced. I agree with Mr McClarty: if it is not broken,  there is no reason to fix it. I oppose the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I call on Mr Paul Maskey to conclude the debate. He has five minutes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I will not take the full five minutes,  I assure you of that first off. Nine Members spoke, including me. Although an  hour was set aside for the debate, it was over quickly. We have to be thankful  for that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in will support the motion, which is in the names of  both the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in. We look at this issue as we do with anything else.  When there are Committee Chairpersons, there are also Committee Deputy  Chairpersons who are prepared to step in. I know that there are Deputy  Speakers; however, we are looking at the Principal Deputy Speaker. We recognise  the fact that the job of the Ceann Comhairle, the Speaker of the Assembly, is  very busy. He performs many different duties and tasks and attends hundreds of  events every year.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A Principal Deputy Speaker is a good sign and will  hopefully be a good way for someone to build up further experience when it  comes to the possibility of taking on the job of Speaker. It is about  leadership and about showing that the Assembly can work together. We are in for  power sharing: why not power-share on the job of Speaker by having a Principal  Deputy Speaker?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some of the other parties have said that the post is about  jobs for the boys and is a carve-up between the two biggest parties. Members  from other parties spoke. However, when their parties were the two largest in  the Chamber, they did not offer too much to anyone else either. So, they are  doing a bit of showboating today. I heard Jim Allister going on about  showboating, but that is exactly what he is doing. Many people in the Chamber &mdash;  certainly me &mdash; are already fed up listening to the same rhetoric that we have  heard in the past couple of days from the likes of Jim.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Allister</strong>:  Get used to it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. Allow the Member to continue.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  He can chirp all he wants from the sidelines but, at the end of the day, it is  a lonely voice in a lonely corner in one part of the Chamber. We are all about  moving on collectively and making sure that all the parties in here work  collectively to show the people outside this House that we can do this. For far  too long, that was not the case. I urge all parties in the Chamber to support  the motion today to show the outside world and the people who have put us all  into our positions in the Assembly that we can work together.</p>
