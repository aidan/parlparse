      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The Assembly met at 10.30 am (Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr  McClarty] in the Chair).</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="1"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
      <p class="H4StageHeading">North/South Ministerial Council Environment Sectoral  Format</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker (Mr McClarty)</strong>: I have received notice from the Minister of the  Environment that he wishes to make a statement regarding the North/South  Ministerial Council meeting in environment sectoral format.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment (Mr S Wilson)</strong>: In compliance with section 52 of the  Northern Ireland Act 1998, I will make a statement on the eighth meeting of the  North/South Ministerial Council (NSMC) in environment sectoral format that was  held on 20 March at Farmleigh House in Dublin.  The report has been agreed with Minister Ritchie, who was also in attendance.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Irish Government were represented by John Gormley TD, Minister  for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, who chaired the meeting,  and I, as Environment Minister, with Margaret Ritchie, the Minister for Social  Development, represented the Northern Ireland Executive.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Council received a report on the progress that has been  made to date on the ongoing discussions between the Department of the  Environment, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government  and the relevant competent authorities that are aimed at effecting the  repatriation of illegally dumped cross-border waste.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Ministers noted that Dublin City Council became the  sole Irish competent authority designated for trans-frontier shipments of waste  in July 2007, and it is committed to letting a contract for the removal of waste  at Slattinagh and Trillick and its disposal in a suitable facility in Ireland. They  also noted that a draft framework agreement that covers key issues surrounding the  scope of the work, the methodology to be employed and the apportionment of  costs has been developed and, it is hoped, will be agreed in the near future.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Council welcomed the joint concerted enforcement  actions that are continuing to target shipments of waste and noted that future  action is planned. The Council also received a presentation from the Northern  Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)  on current work and the potential for co-operation on environmental research  and state-of-environment reporting with the aim of providing positive outcomes  for the environment and the economy.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Ministers noted that the EPA and NIEA will bring  forward proposals at the next NSMC meeting in the environment sectoral format  for continued co-operation in this area.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Those will involve the development and publication of a  common set of environment indicators, enhanced co-operation and further work in  relation to environ&shy;mental research and on environmental technologies, as well  as co-operation to ensure that, building on the experience of the jointly  developed North/South website for environmental research (known as the &lsquo;aNSwer&rsquo;  website), information on environmental projects across the island of Ireland  is made available.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Council welcomed the continuing progress on the  implementation of the EU water framework directive for shared waters, and, in  particular, the achievement of another important deadline with the publication  of the draft river basin management plans for three cross-border international  river basin districts: the North Western, the Neagh Bann and the Shannon.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Council noted that the publication of the draft plans  for a six-month public consultation period is a significant step towards the  development and publication by December 2009 of the final river basin  management plans, which will help to protect and improve the water environment  in cross-border international river basin districts and throughout both  jurisdictions. Ministers welcomed the opportunity for the public in both  jurisdictions to contribute to the river basin planning process through  responding to the consultation on the draft river basin management plans.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Council also noted the carrying out of a jointly funded  strategic environment assessment in parallel with the management plans to  evaluate the environ&shy;mental consequences of the plans and the programme of  measures, and to consult with the public in that regard.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Council noted the importance of the development of  markets for recycled materials, and, in particular, the strategic documents  &lsquo;Towards Resource Management: The Northern Ireland Waste Management Strategy  2006-2020&rsquo; and, in Ireland,  the &lsquo;Market Development Programme for Waste Resources 2007-2011&rsquo;.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Ministers welcomed the reconstituted North/South market  development steering group, which includes representatives from the business  and non-governmental sectors and was established to drive forward a market  development programme for recyclable material. The terms of reference of the  group, which will be reviewed on an annual basis, currently includes the  following priority waste streams: organics; food waste; domestic waste  plastics; construction and demolition waste.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Council also noted the North/South market development  steering group&rsquo;s intention to consider developments in the proposal for an  all-island paper mill, and Ministers agreed to consider that issue at the next  NSMC meeting in the environment sectoral format. The Council agreed to meet  again in that sector in September or October 2009.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for the Environment (Mr McGlone)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a  LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his statement on the North/South  Ministerial Council environment sectoral meeting. On behalf of the Environment  Committee, I welcome the arrangements announced by the Minister for increased  co-ordination and co-operation for the benefit of the environment on the entire  island.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In his statement, the Minister referred to:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;joint concerted enforcement actions that are  continuing to target shipments of waste&rdquo;.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">In April 2008, in response to a question about  illegal dumping, the Environment Committee was told by the Department that the  illegal depositing of waste in the North was extremely profitable to those  involved due to the costs of legal disposal, and that the disparity in the cost  of disposal of waste to landfill in each jurisdiction was acting as an economic  driver and was encouraging the illegal transport of waste from the Republic  into the North.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Can the Minister tell us, therefore, what concerted enforcement  actions have been taking place to address the illegal transport of waste into  the North, what his Department has done to reduce the economic drivers that  might be exacerbating that, and what measures he is taking, as Minister, to  prevent any increased pressure that the global economic downturn might have on  that illegal activity?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I thank the Chairperson of the Environment Committee for  his questions. I, too, recognise the importance of co-ordination, because, of  course, when it comes to river pollution or other forms of pollution, the  border does not act as a barrier to its movement.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, I see that there are good grounds for  co-operation with the authorities in the Republic. As the Member well knows,  lack of co-ordination in the past may have led to some of the problems to which  he referred in his second question.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will say two things in reply; first, about practical  joint action and, secondly, about what we are doing to make that activity less  profitable. There have already been a number of joint ventures between the  Northern Ireland Environment Agency and the Irish Republic&rsquo;s  Environmental Protection Agency. In fact, the last joint action was taken in  January and February this year, when the Northern Ireland Environment Agency&rsquo;s  trans-frontier shipment of waste team conducted joint inspections with Dublin  City Council on both sides of the border. That action and those inspections are  intelligence-led. It is important that the authorities on both sides of the border  are aware of the likely movements of waste, especially those that will be  undertaken by people with a record of illegal activity. It is important that  there is not only a sharing of intelligence but co-operation and co-ordination  of enforcement action on both sides of the border.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Since 2007, the Northern Ireland Environment Agency has  conducted five verification inspections of notifiable and green-list waste  movements, and four joint road and port inspections with Dublin City Council.  Further joint inspections are planned. I want to see more of that activity  taking place, and we will be pushing for more to be done.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The enforcement section in Northern Ireland has the job of  ensuring that dumping illegal waste does not pay. There is evidence of where we  have gone after people hard once we have identified that they have allowed  illegal waste to be deposited on their land. So far, there have been 33  convictions, with five prison sentences handed out that have ranged from two to  12 months. I want to see more convictions. There have been 87 enforcement files  involving incidents of waste from the Irish Republic.  We are preparing the files; we are taking people to court; we are securing  convictions and &mdash; in addition &mdash; we are seizing assets. So far, around &pound;800,000  of assets have been seized. Some of those cases are subject to appeal in the  court. Nevertheless, the Chairperson has made an important point: we must  ensure that we do not allow people to benefit from dumping illegal waste. They  may think twice about doing so if they know that they will be caught and  punished severely.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: The  Minister referred to environmental research and to a degree of work and  co-operation with the Irish   Republic. Will he expand  on the discussions that were held on the benefits of joint research, and will  he outline the benefits of joint working between the Environment Protection  Agency and its Irish equivalent on the environmental indicators?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: At the meeting, there was a presentation from representatives  from Northern Ireland  and the Environmental Protection Agency in the Republic outlining the research  to date and the work that they intend to do. That joint presentation was well  received by officials and Ministers. It illustrated how each report uses  similar indictors, and provided an overview of the continuing work to develop a  single comparable set of all-island environmental indicators.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">10.45 am</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The possible benefits of that include having common  international research linkages. Funds could be drawn down for that because EU  research funds would be levered. Such a single set of indicators would also  ensure that there is a value-for-money approach to research projects. Whenever  we spend money on projects, the co-operation that is involved means that we  should achieve maximum value from that money. Therefore, additional funding  will be brought down because it will be easier to lever EU funding, and greater  value for money should be ensured.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">At the next meeting, we will consider proposals on the way  forward. At that stage, we will perhaps be able to flesh out some of the  benefits that have been realised.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  statement. He will know that I raised the issue of illegal dumping previously  in the Chamber. What is the time frame for the repatriation of the identified  sites? Have any new sites been identified? In the past 12 months or so, local  councils &mdash; including mine &mdash; and the Forest Service have had to pay for the  removal of waste. Was there any discussion about reimbursing the councils for  the resources that they have had to use to remove that waste? Go raibh maith  agat.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: As far as I know, about 20 sites have been identified so  far. I want to see the process moving quickly, because some of those sites are  already leaking leachate into water courses and are causing severe pollution.  It is important that we move quickly so that we can deal with that situation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The two sites that I mentioned in the statement are the  first two to have been identified. I think that we are now close to reaching  agreement with the competent authority in the Republic, which is Dublin City  Council. Once that agreement has been signed, the procurement process will  begin. Under the EU rules that apply to the size of the contract, that process  must last for about four or five months. After that, work will start to remove  the waste and to dispose of it in the Republic. Remediation work will then be  done on the two sites, after which we will work through the rest of the sites.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I cannot honestly give the Member a timescale for the  remediation work and for the removal of waste from all the other sites.  However, I told Minister Gormley that once the process starts and we have  identified the waste in the sites, I want to see the process moving as quickly  as possible.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The apportionment of the cost of reimbursements for the  removal of waste from now on will be part of the agreement that is finally  settled. However, I make it quite clear that since the waste came from the  Republic and was dumped illegally in Northern Ireland, a substantial  proportion of the costs should be borne by the authority that was responsible  for dealing with the waste in the Republic.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: In  his statement, the Minister indicated that the EPA and the Northern Ireland  Environment Agency will bring forward proposals to the next North/South  Ministerial Council in environment sectoral format. He stated that part of that  work will involve the development and publication of a common set of  environmental indicators.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister agree that it is important that those  indicators remain consistent with those that are used throughout the rest of  the United Kingdom so that  we are able to compare environmental standards in Northern   Ireland with those in the rest of the United Kingdom?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Whenever we assess the state of the environment in  different jurisdictions, we want to have comparable data. An awful lot of EU  framework directives require common assessments in countries throughout Europe. Therefore, the more consistent that we can make  those indicators so that one country can be compared with another, the better.  That is important even from an EU point of view.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I,  too, thank the Minister for his statement. First, I noticed that when he was  talking about the river basin management plans the Minister mentioned carrying  out a strategic environmental assessment. Will he give us details of the timing  of that assessment; who will carry it out; and what sort of public consultation  there will be?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, it is clear that the North/South Market  Development Steering Group, which develops markets for recyclables, is good and  necessary. However, the Minister expressed concerns about exporting valuable  recyclable materials to the Far East at an  energy and financial cost. Given that, and in the light of the co-operation  required both North and South, and with the private sector, will he give us any  firm indication of actual developments as opposed to aspirations?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: We had been working towards the development of an  all-Ireland paper mill. However, as is the case with all such initiatives,  unless they are market-driven and a good strong business case can be made for  them, they will not work in the long run. There is no point in setting up  something that is not sustainable or profitable. However, there is renewed  interest in the proposal, and it will be a case of whether business interests  decide there is a market for it in the whole of the island.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">No other specific projects have been mentioned to date.  However, given the downturn in world prices, it is important that we look at  what can be done within the curtilage of our own two countries to try and  ensure that we recycle as much as possible, and recycle it here. If one looks  at how waste prices for recycled material have held up in Northern Ireland,  one can see that we have good long-term contracts anyhow and that most of those  are with businesses that are using waste in a proper and profitable way. We are  fairly well placed in that regard. I do not want to give the impression that  most of the waste that we recycle is sent around the world, when, in fact,  local contracts are already in place. It essentially reflects my economic  philosophy that unless things can be done on the basis of business and  profitability, many people will call into question the sustainability of some  of the recycling targets.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Northern Ireland Environment Agency is carrying out the  strategic environment assessment of water management at the moment.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement, and I welcome the steps that his  Department has taken to combat illegal dumping. My question is on water-quality  management. Will the Minister give us details on what further North/South  co-operation there will be on the implementation of the Water Framework  Directive?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: First, as I said in my statement, public consultation on  the draft river basin management plans is ongoing in Northern Ireland and the Republic  and will continue until June.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, we are holding water information days and events  to engage with interested parties, and those events are being held in both  jurisdictions. Officials have been co-ordinating arrangements where possible,  because, in places in which there is joint interest in a river basin, it will  be easier for people to give their views to either the Northern Ireland  Environment Agency or the Environmental Protection Agency in the South.  Reciprocal invitations have been extended to people in both jurisdictions.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Co-ordination is ongoing at policy and technical level  between officials in both jurisdictions. The main reason for that is to  facilitate the preparation of the final plans. We aim to have the final river  basin management plans published in both jurisdictions on 22 December, so a  Christmas present will be available for those who are interested in that.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Doherty</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  statement and, particularly, paragraph 4&rsquo;s reference to the removal of material  from Trillick, which is part of my constituency. I have been working on that  issue for some months, and I am delighted that it has reached this stage. The  Minister&rsquo;s written statement refers to &ldquo;the apportionment of costs&rdquo;, but he  used the word &ldquo;enforcement&rdquo; in his verbal statement. I would like him to  elaborate on that. I agree with the Minister that the vast proportion of costs  should lie with the South, because that is where the waste has come from.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, paragraph 13 of the written statement &#8213; and  the Minister may, to some extent, have answered this question &#8213; refers to an  all-island paper mill. Would that mill be about recycling, or about  afforestation, the cutting of trees and feeding into the production of brand  new paper, or a combination of both? On a slightly lighter note, in the House  last week, the Minister talked about the skies having been blue when he was in Dublin. I had not  realised that it was 20 March when he was in Dublin. I happened to be in London on 20 March and the skies were blue  there, too. So, just to put his mind at ease: partition has nothing to do with  the colour of the sky. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I am also well informed that the skies were blue in Belfast on that day, too,  so there was a certain amount of commonality across all the islands on that  day. However, I must say that it was a beautiful morning in Dublin, and I had the opportunity to act in a  very environmentally friendly way and walk to the meeting &#8213; and it was a very  pleasant walk.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>A Member</strong>:  Did the Minister walk from Belfast?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: No; I did not walk from Belfast. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to the Member&rsquo;s questions: as far as recycling  is concerned, I am not quite up to date on all the technology of paper mills,  but it is my understanding that any proposed paper mill would be built,  primarily, to use recycled materials. That was the whole point of the facility,  and to give us some of the economies of scale that are required to deal with  the waste paper that is generated in Northern   Ireland and the Irish Republic.  I suspect, though, that some virgin material would have to be put into a paper  mill to make it work, but, as I said, I could be totally wrong about that  because I do not know the technology behind it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">My use of the word &ldquo;enforcement&rdquo; referred to having proper  enforcement regimes in place to ensure that the problem was not repeated. Of  course, the apportionment of costs will not be a case of enforcing, it will be  a case of an agreement that is reached between me and the Environment Minister  in the Republic or &mdash; more properly speaking &mdash; with Dublin City Council, the  competent authority. Those costs, and the apportionment of those costs, will be  in the final agreement.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I made it very clear to the Minister that the issue has  dragged on for too long. It is causing a problem. Increasingly, as those sites  get older, the pollution problems caused by them will increase. To be fair to  the Minister, he, too, wants a quick resolution. There was a meeting of minds on  the issue, and I hope that the work will start sooner rather than later, and  that the agreement will be signed in the next few weeks.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">11.00 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  I, too, welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. He referred to, as Mr Ford noted  earlier, the reconstitution of the North/South market development steering  group. Does the Minister consider that the reconstituted body will produce any  benefits for the people of Northern    Ireland?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The whole idea of the North/South market development  steering group is to involve people from business and non-governmental sectors  in finding a way to drive forward the management and recycling of waste across  the island. It will look at matters such as organics, food waste, domestic  waste, plastics, construction and demolition waste. Any progress that can be  made in helping us to meet our targets for recycling in those areas is  important. We have stringent targets to meet by 2020, and any contribution,  whether made by our agencies or by the steering group, will be beneficial to  both Northern Ireland and  the Irish Republic.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: I  also thank the Minister for his timely statement. My question is similar to  that posed by Mr Doherty; it refers to the transport to Northern Ireland  of cross-frontier shipments of waste. That waste creates leachate and the  Minister has said that he is concerned that the matter be resolved sooner  rather than later. Is it likely to be resolved before the next meeting of the  group, which will be at the end of this year, or can it be done sooner?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I hope that the agreement will be signed within the next  few weeks. For the North/South Ministerial Council meeting, we had a road map  as to how the problem should be addressed. I emphasise that it should not only  address the legacy of waste that is deposited in Northern Ireland sites; it is more  important to avoid it happening again. As other Members have pointed out, there  are economic benefits for those who wish to engage in that trade, not least for  those in the Irish Republic for whom it presents an opportunity to avoid the  heavy landfill tax, and for those in Northern Ireland who take waste onto their  land and probably get huge cash payments in return.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The road map considers what the issues are with illegal  waste; what needs to be done in respect of it; how we will ascertain whether  there is waste on particular sites; what we should do about it; the joint  operations to which I referred earlier; and how, in future, we can avoid this  situation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The draft agreement is with my officials, who are checking  that it reflects what was agreed in the road map. If the two Ministers can sign  it within the next few weeks, there is then a four- to five-month procurement  process to be undergone. That is unavoidable &mdash; it is an EU requirement because  of the size of the contract. Once that contract is signed, the work should  begin. I am not saying that the work will have started by September 2009, or by  the time of the next North/South Ministerial Council meeting. However, I hope  that all the requirements will be in place to allow it to start.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s wide-ranging statement. The most striking aspect of  this report is the growth in the range of issues that are now discussed at  North/South Ministerial Council meetings and that include the environment. That  being the case, the Assembly will have to look seriously at having the issue of  the environment addressed by a new North/South body.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Please ask a question, Mr Gallagher.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  I want to ask the Minister about the illegal waste at Garrison and Trillick,  particularly at Garrison, as it is close to Lough Melvin, one of the best  fishing lakes in these islands and which has, and has for centuries, made a  very important contribution to the local economy. On 21 November, I received an  answer from the Minister in which he said pretty much what has been repeated  here today. He said that the remaining issues could be resolved before the end  of the year and that the contract procurement could be allowed to proceed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I understand the Minister&rsquo;s difficulties; however, we are  not any further forward. When this matter comes up again at the next  North/South Ministerial Council meeting, will representatives from Dublin City  Council be present so that there can be some sort of face-to-face encounter? In  Fermanagh and Tyrone, the feeling is that sites in the west are not a priority.  Will the Minister give his views on that?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order, order. That was a very creative use of your time, Mr  Gallagher.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: If it takes me as long to get agreement as it took the  Member to get his question out, I think that we will still be talking about it  this time next year.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I reject the Member&rsquo;s point that there has been no progress  since November. We now have a road map and a draft agreement. Perhaps the  Member would have preferred that we had not gone down the normal route. It is a  mandated issue and it had to be dealt with at the North/South Ministerial  Council meeting. The matter was dealt with at the first North/South Ministerial  Council meeting since I became responsible for the environment. We are now in  the process of checking the details of that and signing off on it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have given the Member a timetable, and the road map  includes the details of the agreement. Minister Gormley and I have agreed that  that is a way forward. It is now the case, of course, that it has to be written  down in the form of a contract. I have told the Member that it will be signed  off in the next few weeks. I have told him what the procurement process is  going to be and how long it is going to take. I do not know what else the  Member wishes for.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As far as I am concerned, the issue was raised with me when  I became Minister, and I made it clear that I wanted it dealt with as quickly  as possible. The fact is that we now have ministerial agreement on it, which we  did not have in November; we have the details of that, which we did not have in  November; we are on the point of signing off on that, which we were not in  November; we know what has to be contained in that, which we did not in  November, including the identifi&shy;cation, removal and disposal of illegal waste,  the making good of the site and the apportionment of costs.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I cannot understand how the Member came to the conclusion  that he has. Then again, I do not always understand his thought processes; for  example, he still thinks that the sun moves around the earth.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement. Illegal waste is often associated with  fuel laundering and smuggling &mdash; and I am thinking about the lorry load of fuel  that went on fire between Lisburn and Carryduff. Has the Minister had any  co-operation with his counterpart in the Republic of Ireland  in relation to the fight against illegal fuel launderers and the smuggling of  illegal fuel?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The Member is quite right: fuel laundering is polluting in  nature because the chemicals used to remove the dye are usually dumped in water  courses. As that is a clandestine activity, it is very hard to identify the  full extent of the environmental damage that that residue might cause.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am not avoiding the issue of co-operation with the  Republic, but HM Revenue and Customs deals with fuel laundering. It tackles and  prevents illegal fuel laundering and smuggling. It is not appropriate for me to  comment on the level of co-operation, because the Department is not involved in  that.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement. Like Mr Doherty, I have concerns about  the illegal waste in Trillick, and I commend the Minister on the ongoing work  on that matter. What work has been done by the Department of the Environment to  encourage community-recycling networking?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The Department recognises that recycling must be dealt  with at local level. We must ensure that local people are signed up to  community recycling. Networking with communities is done through the waste and  resources action programme (WRAP), which the Department funds to the tune of  around &pound;1 million a year. Its job is to work closely with businesses and to  encourage them to undertake initiatives to deliver increases in recycling, such  as using recycled materials in construction and manufacturing. That, of course,  reduces the amount of waste that goes to landfill.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his useful statement. I notice that it is marked as  &ldquo;Restricted&rdquo;, and I wondered whether the DUP Whip was exerting discipline on  the Minister&rsquo;s statements.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Earlier, questions were asked on the markets for recycled  materials. I hear the public expressing quite a bit of concern that because of  the economic downturn, some of the existing markets for recycled materials have  disappeared. Will the Minister give an assurance that when householders recycle  materials, those are genuinely going into recycling?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The market for recyclables is similar to any market, but  it is more prone to the ups and downs of the economic cycle. People who are  involved in recycling will know that in the 1990s, it hit a low patch. As I  said in answer to earlier questions, Northern Ireland is much better  placed in the use of recycled materials, because we entered into long-term  contracts and although we are not immune to the ups and downs of the market, we  are less prone to that. We have a market for the materials that we collect.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is not clear when the markets will function normally  again, but we believe that the low prices are a temporary phenomena. Therefore,  we have allowed the storing of recycled materials. Normally, restrictions are  placed on that, but we have recognised that rather than having recycling  materials used in a way that they should not be, some storage should be  allowed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I was concerned about some of the stories that appeared in  the papers about that, because I want to encourage people to continue to  recycle materials as much as possible.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In a statement on 12 January 2009, I made it clear that  materials that are collected for recycling in Northern Ireland do not go to  landfill, but are used for the purpose for which they are intended.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">11.15 am</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>My Deputy  Speaker</strong>: That concludes questions to the Minister of the Environment on his  statement.<strong><span style="text-transform:uppercase; font-size:12.0pt; "> </span></strong></p>
      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="2"></a>Executive Committee Business</p>
      <p class="H4StageHeading">Pneumoconiosis, etc., (Workers&rsquo; Compensation) (Payment  of Claims) (Amendment) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2009</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName" style="margin-left:11.35pt;text-indent:0cm;"><strong>The Minister for Social Development (Ms  Ritchie)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">That the Pneumoconiosis, etc., (Workers&rsquo; Compensation)  (Payment of Claims) (Amendment) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2009 be affirmed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">These regulations are made under the Pneumoconiosis, etc.,  (Workers&rsquo; Compensation) (Northern    Ireland) Order 1979 and increase by 5% the  compensation that is payable under the Order to people who satisfy the  conditions of entitlement on or after 1 April 2009. The increase in the amount  that is payable under the Order maintains parity with the corresponding scheme  that operates in Britain  and is in line with annual uprating of social security benefits.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will explain briefly the Order&rsquo;s purpose. An employer can  be sued by someone who suffers from an industrial disease when that disease was  contracted as a result of working for that employer. However, the diseases that  are covered by the Order can take a long time to develop and may not be  diagnosed for 20, 40 or even more years after exposure to dust. By that time,  the employer or employers who are responsible may no longer exist.  Consequently, sufferers and their dependants can experience great difficulty in  obtaining compensation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The scheme was introduced in 1979 to help people who have  no realistic chance of success in suing through the courts, as their employers  are no longer in business. It provides for a lump-sum payment to sufferers.  Payments are in addition to any award of weekly industrial injuries disablement  benefit for the same disease. A claim can also be made by dependants after the  sufferer&rsquo;s death.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In order to receive a payment under the 1979 scheme, a  person must have been awarded industrial injuries disablement benefit. Two  further conditions must be met before any payment can be made. First, there  must be no relevant employer who can be sued. Secondly, court action must not  have been brought or compensation received in respect of any of the diseases  for which a person is claiming.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The scheme covers five respiratory diseases, most of which  are directly related to asbestos exposure. They are diffuse mesothelioma;  diffuse pleural thickening; primary carcinoma of the lung; byssinosis; and  pneumoconiosis, which includes asbestosis.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Some people who suffer from mesothelioma are not entitled  to any payment under the 1979 scheme because they were not exposed to asbestos  in the workplace. However, since October 2008, the new mesothelioma scheme  provides for lump-sum payments to sufferers of the disease, regardless of  whether they were employees, self-employed or, indeed, had never worked,  provided that they have not already received compensation from another source.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The amount to be paid under the regulations is based on a  simple calculation, which cross-references the sufferer&rsquo;s age and level of  disability. Higher amounts are paid to people who have higher levels of  disability and whose disability arises at an early age. The maximum amount that  can be paid from April 2009 is just over &pound;74,000 for a person who is 37 years  old or under at diagnosis. Lower amounts are payable to dependants who claim  after the sufferer has died.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The regulations will help to ensure that the compensation  that is provided under the Order maintains its value in line with the rate of  inflation. I am sure that all Members will welcome the regulations warmly.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Social Development (Mr Simpson)</strong>: At its meeting on 26  February 2009, the Committee for Social Development considered the Department&rsquo;s  proposal to introduce The Pneumoconiosis, etc., (Workers&rsquo; Compensation)  (Payment of Claims) (Amendment) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2009, and on 12  March, it considered the statutory rule. The regulations will increase the  amounts that are payable to the sufferers of certain dust-related diseases &mdash; or  their dependants &mdash; who have been unable to claim damages from the relevant employer  because that employer is no longer in business.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Dust-related diseases can take a long time to develop and  may not be diagnosed until a considerable number of years after exposure.  Therefore, it may be a common scenario that the employer that is responsible  for the dust exposure is no longer in business when claims arise.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Although no amount of money could compensate for the misery  and suffering that is caused by diseases such as pneumoconiosis, the amounts  that are payable will offer some assistance to sufferers and their dependants.  It is important that the compensation increases and that those amounts keep  pace with inflation. In conclusion, the Committee recommends that the Assembly  affirm the statutory rule.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I support the introduction of the  regulations. Pneumoconiosis is a particularly nasty and debilitating condition  that, as has been stated, takes a long time to manifest itself in many cases.  Therefore, under the new regulations, people who, because the relevant employer  no longer exists, had no recourse to any other form of compensation will  receive compensation. I welcome the regulations. Go raibh maith agat, a  LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: Like  the Members who spoke previously, I welcome this new piece of legislation,  which is fair, humane and compassionate. People who have contracted such  conditions through work suffer greatly, and it is important that, where the  employer cannot look after them, we make their lives easier.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I am pleased with the consensus of support in the  Assembly for the regulations. I thank Mr Simpson, the Committee for Social  Development, Mr Brady and Ms Lo for the positive way in which they dealt with  the regulations. Mr Simpson made an apt point; no amount of compensation will  ever cover the misery and suffering that people endure as a result of those  illnesses.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am certain that all Members want to ensure that inflation  does not erode the value of compensation under the 1979 Order. It is important  that the Assembly and the Executive deal with the matter in line with parity.  The regulations will ensure that inflation does not erode compensation rates  and that people in Northern    Ireland who suffer from those ailments receive  the amount to which they are entitled. I commend the motion to the House.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">That The Pneumoconiosis, etc., (Workers&rsquo; Compensation)  (Payment of Claims) (Amendment) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2009 be affirmed.</p>
      <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="3"></a>The Pre-Release Access to Official Statistics (Northern Ireland)  Order 2009</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel (Mr Dodds)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">That the Pre-Release Access to Official Statistics Order (Northern Ireland)  2009 be affirmed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Order is part of a wider programme of work implementing  the Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007. That Act established an  independent United Kingdom Statistics Authority to promote and safeguard the  production and publication of official statistics, and it requires the  introduction of secondary legislation in Northern   Ireland setting out rules and principles to be followed  when granting pre-release access to official Northern Ireland devolved  statistics.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Pre-release access to statistics is access primarily by  Ministers and officials to the final statistics in the form in which they are  to be published in advance of their release. The aim of pre-release access is  to enable Ministers at the time of release to account for the implications of  the policy areas for which they are responsible. It also allows Ministers and  their supporting officials to take any immediate action that might be required  in light of the statistical information being released.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Under current arrangements, Ministers and certain officials  have privileged access to statistics ahead of their publication of up to five  days&rsquo; pre-release access in general and up to 40&middot;5 hours for market-sensitive  statistics. It is considered necessary to change the arrangements because  pre-release access is sometimes cited as a contributing factor to problems of  trust and confidence in official statistics.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is no reason to believe that there is a problem of  substance in Northern    Ireland, but the Executive are committed to  tackling any perception of interference in statistics. The Cabinet Office is  responsible for bringing forward similar proposals for the UK Government,  including the Northern Ireland Office (NIO), and the key elements of their  legislation &mdash; which came into operation on 1 December 2008 &mdash; are limiting pre-release  access to a strict maximum of 24 hours; requiring that pre-release access be  limited to the minimum necessary number of people and the minimum number of  statistics; and requiring that, where pre-release access is granted, it should  be done in an open and transparent manner, with details documented and  published.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There were no Northern Ireland-specific responses to the UK  Government&rsquo;s public consultation on the issue in 2008. Executive Ministers were  consulted in 2008, and replies were supportive of the changes incorporated in  the legislation. The Northern    Ireland statistics advisory committee was  also consulted and fully endorsed the proposals. In addition, as required by  the legislation, the UK Statistics Authority, the Minister for the Cabinet Office,  and Scottish and Welsh Ministers have all been consulted, and there are no  unresolved issues.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive, at their meeting on 20 November 2008,  approved the making of the pre-release Order, broadly reflecting arrangements  in place at UK-Government level, including the NIO. Thus it is proposed that  pre-release access will be limited to a strict maximum of 24 hours, be limited  to the minimum necessary number of people and the minimum number of statistics,  and, where pre-release access is granted, it should be done in an open and  transparent manner.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The need for pre-release access to a publication, and the  people who are to be granted access, will be reviewed ahead of the release of  the relevant statistics. In Northern Ireland,  as at UK  level, decisions on pre-release access will be led by statistical professionals.  Each Northern Ireland Department will be expected to implement the new  arrangements and publish a compliance statement to that effect.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Once pre-release access to a statistic in a final form has  been granted, it will be under embargo, which means that its contents cannot be  shared with others until the point of publication. Those granted pre-release  access to statistics must, as now, not alter, or attempt to alter, the content  or timing of the releases or the way in which they are presented. The  pre-release access period must not be used for personal or political gain.  Pre-release access may be removed from anyone who knowingly breaches those  rules.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The rules ensure that pre-release will take place in an  open, clear and transparent manner, with clear accountability; that represents  a tightening of current practice. Passage of the Order will also ensure  consistency with the position at a United Kingdom-level, including the Northern  Ireland Office. The new arrangements will be reviewed after 12 months of  operation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Order has been considered by the Committee for Finance  and Personnel, and no objections have been raised. I, therefore, commend the  Order to the Assembly.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">11.30 am</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Finance and Personnel (Mr McLaughlin)</strong>: Go raibh maith  agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I wish to make it clear that I am speaking as the  Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and Personnel, and I will confine  myself to speaking in that capacity.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Minister for his opening remarks. The Committee  for Finance and Personnel considered the Department&rsquo;s proposal to make this  subordinate legislation at its meeting on 25 February 2009 and agreed that it  was content with the policy implications of the proposed legislation at that  stage. The rule was subsequently laid in the Assembly, and the Committee  considered that rule and the accompanying report from the Examiner of Statutory  Rules on 18 March. The Committee agreed to recommend that the rule be affirmed.  However, it sought clarification from the Department of Finance and Personnel  on issues contained in the explanatory memorandum, which does not form part of  the legislation. The Minister mentioned that in his statement.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The explanatory memorandum states that under current  arrangements, Ministers may have up to 40&middot;5 hours&rsquo; access to market-sensitive  statistics prior to publication. The Committee was intrigued by the mention of  the 40&middot;5 hours&rsquo; access period. The purpose of pre-release access is to enable  Ministers and certain officials to account for the policy implications of  statistics at the time of publication and, in certain circumstances, to be in a  position to announce policy decisions when the data is released. The Committee  was informed that the 40&middot;5-hour period originates in the release practices  protocol of the National Statistics Code of Practice, which will be superseded  by the new arrangements in the 2009 Order. That 40&middot;5-hour period means that,  where privileged early access to market-sensitive statistics is granted, it  will begin at 5.00 pm on day one, in advance of the release of the data at 9.30  am on day three.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Under the new arrangements, pre-release access for all  official statistics will be limited to a strict maximum of 24 hours, and no  distinction will be made between market-sensitive and non-market-sensitive  statistics. The Committee for Finance and Personnel considered that further  information on 25 March and agreed that it was content. On behalf of the  Committee, I support the motion.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  want to express my support for the Order. The issue is important, but, as the  Minister said, it is less significant for a devolved region than it is for Westminster. I want to  express my appreciation of the work of the Northern Ireland Statistics and  Research Agency (NISRA), which provides an excellent service to Government.  Statistics and research information from NISRA can be treated with a great deal  of respect.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is an important principle involved. There should be a  necessary distance between Ministers and those who compile and issue  statistics. The statistics that are issued can be politically relevant and, at  times, embarrassing for Government. Therefore, the controls that are contained  in the Order are important.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is good that, in principle, we are moving to a maximum  24 hours of pre-access and the other restrictions on the persons to whom  statistics are divulged that the Minister mentioned. Previously, as I  understand it, there was a mere convention about a five-day access period in  certain instances and 40&middot;5 hours for market-sensitive information. The narrower  period is desirable and indicates that the maintenance of a necessary distance  is being properly considered.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have one question for the Minister. Certain statistics will  be issued according to a predetermined timetable. Are there other statistics  that are issued at the determination of a particular person? Is there any  discussion between those who issue statistics and Ministers as to the  appropriate time period in which a set of statistics that might have political  implications is issued?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I am grateful to the two Members who contributed to  the debate and put forward the views of the Committee for Finance and  Personnel. I welcome their remarks, and I thank the Chairperson of the  Committee and its members, who scrutinised the Order.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr O&rsquo;Loan raised an issue about access to statistics. He  also pointed out, quite rightly, that a debt of gratitude is owed to the people  who are involved in this area of work, such as those from NISRA, my Department  and statisticians in general, because they do fine work on behalf of the  public. It is important that I put that on the record.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As regards another issue that Mr O&rsquo;Loan raised, Ministers  will be aware of the statistics to be issued; however, they will be unaware of  the actual content of those until 24 hours beforehand. I hope that that assures  the Member.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I ask Members to affirm the Pre-Release Access to Official  Statistics Order (Northern    Ireland) 2009, which should come into  operation from 1 April 2009.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">That the Pre-Release Access to Official Statistics Order (Northern Ireland)  2009 be affirmed.</p>
      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="4" id="4"></a>Private Members&rsquo; Business</p>
      <p class="H4StageHeading">Domestic Violence</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30  minutes for the debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes to  propose and 10 minutes to make a winding-up speech. All other Members who are  called to speak will have five minutes.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly deplores any instance of domestic violence  and its implications for children, young people and vulnerable adults; calls on  the Executive to bring forward proposals to ensure full access to refuge for  persons affected and to address the issue of access to legal aid for vulnerable  families; and further calls for adequate funding for the relevant support  groups and community organisations in their campaigns and work in tackling  domestic violence.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I ask the Assembly to support this important motion. I  apologise on behalf of my colleague Sue Ramsey who cannot be here to move the  motion because she is ill.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Domestic violence is a crime, and it is a violation of  article 5 of the UN Universal Declarations of Human Rights. The impact of  domestic violence on families is devastating. Statistics estimate that a  quarter of all women experience some form of domestic abuse at some stage in  their lives and that almost half the women who are murdered here are killed by  their partners.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Anyone can be a victim of domestic violence. Victims can be  any age, sex, race, culture and religion. They can be from any social  background, be employed or unemployed, and they can have any marital status. The  violence can include physical, sexual and emotional abuse. Although men and  women can be abused, most victims are women and children. A significant number  of elderly people also suffer abuse and neglect in their own homes at the hands  of relatives.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Recent research indicates that almost 11,000 children in  the North of Ireland live in homes in which violence occurs and that there is a  strong link between domestic violence and the mistreatment of children.  Children and young people can often be the forgotten victims of domestic  violence, and the abuse can have far-reaching and long-lasting consequences for  them.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In families in which there is domestic violence, children  are also frequently abused by the violent parent. That can have damaging,  long-term effects on their mental health, their sense of identity and their  ability to form relationships. Domestic abuse can affect a child&rsquo;s performance  at school and can lead to severe behavioural problems, and, sometimes, suicidal  feelings. Domestic violence can also increase the risk of a child self-harming,  misusing drugs and alcohol, and running away from home.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In the longer term, domestic abuse can make children feel  socially and emotionally excluded and lead to problems well into their adult  lives. Essential support work with children and young people that Women&rsquo;s Aid  and other organisations carry out needs to be properly resourced and funded.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">One of the key areas of prevention that has been identified  is that of preventing domestic abuse from happening in the first place by  changing public attitudes to it. It has also been recognised that such an  awareness campaign must take place in schools. Preventative work in schools is  carried out on an ad hoc basis, and, therefore, it is crucial that the  Department of Education introduces preventative programmes as part of the  school curriculum. Work in schools and within local communities sends out an  essential message to children and young people that violence towards them or  against a parent or relative is not acceptable behaviour, and, indeed, that it  is unacceptable behaviour.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We need to ensure that there are services and support in place,  especially refuges, so that anyone who is a victim of domestic violence can  access them. Women&rsquo;s Aid has identified a number of gaps in refuge provision,  including support for women with complex mental- health needs, women who have  issues with drug and alcohol misuse and women with teenage sons. There is also  a problem for women and children who are victims of domestic violence and have  limited or no access to public funds.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In the North, approximately 50% of the population are not  eligible for legal aid, and a further 25% are entitled to only partial  assistance. As I said, that includes women whose immigration status prevents  them from accessing the support services that they need. Very often, the  support organisations have to pick up the costs, which can have an impact on  other areas of their work. Therefore, it is important that an emergency fund is  set up to ensure that all victims of domestic violence can access the support  and refuge services that they need.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Partnership working and inter-agency support will ensure  that adequate provision of refuges and services to support victims of domestic  violence is maintained and developed. Recent statistics show that there has  been an increase in the incidence of domestic violence being reported to the  PSNI. It is believed that a combination of factors, including a Government  advertising campaign and a more proactive approach in recognising domestic  abuse as a crime, are responsible for that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Despite changes from the situation several years ago, there  are still problems in the civil and criminal justice system in the North of  Ireland with regard to domestic violence cases. Women still do not have full  confidence in the criminal justice system due to their experiences when  attempting to get their partners prosecuted. Evidence shows that there is  leniency towards perpetrators of domestic violence, who receive sentences that  are much shorter than if their crime had been committed against a stranger. So,  further steps are needed to ensure that the issue of violence against women  overall, and domestic violence specifically, are given an appropriate  importance in the Government&rsquo;s policy on crime reduction and community safety.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Further changes are earmarked in the &lsquo;protection and  justice&rsquo; section of the Tackling Violence at Home strategy action plan,  including training for the Public Prosecution Service and other justice  agencies. That is to be welcomed as it will result in women feeling more  positive about seeking help. As I said earlier, the lack of access to legal aid  and the &pound;400 cost of a non-molestation order add an unnecessary financial  burden on victims who are already suffering.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is a real need for political direction to ensure that  a clear and consistent message is provided alongside a co-ordinated approach to  tackle the scourge of domestic violence and to provide the support and  protection that victims and survivors need. The Tackling Violence at Home  strategy has the potential to make a fundamental shift in how society responds  to domestic violence. However, its full implementation will require innovative  thinking by all Government Departments and by those working in the statutory,  voluntary, community and business sectors.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">One of the Tackling Violence at Home strategy&rsquo;s successes  was the high-profile publicity campaign that I mentioned, which resulted in an  increase in the number of victims contacting the 24-hour helpline and other  services. That has brought an improved focus and co-ordination in dealing with  domestic violence on a cross-functional basis. We have also seen a range of  associated policy developments that are designed to deal with awareness  training, prevention, supporting victims and dealing with offenders.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is also a need to shift the focus onto the abuser and  to introduce new compulsory rehabilitation programmes, and develop existing  ones, as part of a preventative campaign. That, alongside the training  mechanisms for agencies involved in tackling domestic violence, which are set  out in the strategy, will ensure a more co-ordinated approach.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">All of us here need to give political leadership on the  issue of domestic violence and ensure that the Tackling Violence at Home  strategy is properly implemented and resourced. Debates such as this will raise  awareness on the issue for women, children and anyone else suffering domestic  violence in local communities and who is living every day with the fear and  threat of such violence.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I ask all Members to support the motion, because all of us  have a responsibility to ensure that all the sufferers and survivors of  domestic violence have access to the support and the services that they need.  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">11.45 am</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  I thank the Members who tabled this important motion, which I have no  difficulty in supporting. I also want to record my full support for groups such  as Women&rsquo;s Aid. They do an excellent job in helping those affected by domestic  violence.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to mention, and pay gratitude to, the staff in the  Cookstown Women&rsquo;s Aid centre in my constituency. I know the staff and support  their efforts. I know the difficulties that they have and the problems that  they face in dealing with women who suffer domestic violence.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">All too often, in a debate such as this, we speak of facts,  figures and statistics. I have no doubt that we will hear those today, but I  want to speak about a real matter &mdash; a woman of whom I am aware who has suffered  domestic violence. I hope that it puts today&rsquo;s debate into perspective.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Social services referred this woman and her three children  to a refuge in November 2008. The woman had extensive injuries and had been  taken to hospital for examination. An incident had taken place at her home. She  had been severely beaten and abused by her husband: she sustained bruising to  her face, chest, arms, and abdomen; her eyes were swollen and bloodshot; she  had a fractured finger; and her lower arm was put in plaster.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A PSNI domestic violence officer attended the refuge to  obtain a statement from the woman, and, together with social services, visited  her on a number of occasions during her first week in the refuge. The refuge  staff immediately began to work with the woman through a needs assessment and  support plan, which incorporates the cycle of violence, healthy and unhealthy  relationships, control and power, and the effects of domestic violence on  children.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The victim was enrolled on the Journey to Freedom and My  Life, My Choices programmes, both of which are self-esteem courses that help to  bring women through domestic violence and to begin to move on. She also took  part in the You and Me, Mum course, which considers the effects of domestic  violence on children, and she attended a personal safety seminar organised by  Women&rsquo;s Aid and facilitated by the PSNI community safety officer. She also  attended a Delta parenting programme and a pharmacy programme that examined  topics such as over-the-counter medication, healthy eating, smoking cessation  and anti-depressant usage.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, the woman was unable to leave the refuge  until after 6.00 pm because she was afraid that her partner might be in the  vicinity. She went to her solicitor, and her children were appointed a guardian  ad litem. The woman attended court on a number of occasions and was again supported  by the refuge staff during the hearings.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As a result of the domestic violence perpetrated on this  woman, she could not return to her home and had to terminate her tenancy  agreement. Her furniture and belongings had to be placed in storage. She then  applied for housing in another area and has been on the social housing waiting  list since November 2008. There are no suitable houses available to rehouse her  and her children.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Her perpetrator was released from prison in February 2009  and immediately made it known that he was going to get his wife and children  back as a family. Consequently, the three children were removed from the refuge  and placed in foster care for their own safety and protection.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The sad reality is that the children are still in a foster  placement, although they regularly attend the refuge to visit their mother. The  perpetrator continues to try to contact the woman and has called at the refuge  on two occasions so far. The children are the forgotten victims in this case;  they have been removed from their mother for their own safety.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is no doubt that there is a real need for support  groups such as Women&rsquo;s Aid, but they cannot provide that service without  adequate funding. Domestic violence continues to destroy the lives of hundreds  of vulnerable adults and children throughout Northern Ireland. As elected  representatives, we need to do everything within our power to ensure that  support is available for victims, whether through full access to refuges, legal  aid to vulnerable families or funding for support groups. I support the motion.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Domestic abuse is a blight on our society. It is, unfortunately, much more  common and widespread than society at large cares to recognise.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In Northern Ireland, police respond to reports of domestic  abuse every 23 minutes. The police receive more than 60 such reports every day.  However, those figures mask the countless untold cases of abuse and the misery  that abuse brings to individuals and their families. Indeed, Ian McCrea, a  Member for Mid Ulster, has just given us one such example.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">By its very nature, domestic abuse happens behind closed  doors and between intricately connected people; therefore, there is often a  tendency for others to ignore it and for those who suffer to excuse it. It is  crucial that we send out a clear and concise message that domestic violence is  categorically wrong, that those who suffer from it are not to blame, and that  they will gain the full support that they need from the police, the courts and health  and social services providers in Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Without making domestic violence in any way a political issue, last October, my  colleague Lord Morrow asked the Health Minister &mdash; who I am glad is here for  today&rsquo;s very important debate &mdash; to detail the number of hospital or GP  treatments, broken down by male and female, that were the result of domestic  violence or abuse. The answer was that that information was not available.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Member join us today in asking the Minister to  consider that issue, which was referred to by my colleague the Member from Mid  Ulster? It is vital that victims who go to hospital are identified and treated  in accordance with the very serious issues that are raised.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Will the Member join me in welcoming the development &mdash; led by the Policing Board  &mdash; that all reported incidents of domestic violence are now split by gender and  by the relationship between the attacker and the victim? That policy has  evolved over a year&rsquo;s work, during which people have had to look at the statistics.  Indeed, good statistics lead to good politics.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I thank both my colleague Basil McCrea and Mervyn Storey, a Member for North  Antrim, for their useful interventions. The key message is that there must be a  co-ordinated approach, and as Basil McCrea said, the figures are needed in  order to ensure that the right responses and proper policies on how to tackle  this scourge are adopted.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We must not forget that domestic abuse, although commonly  physical, can also be sexual, psychological or financial. It affects women and  children and sometimes men. About 20% of domestic abuse begins during pregnancy  and is often associated with alcohol and drug abuse. We must reduce domestic  abuse, and to do so requires a co-ordinated and joined-up approach across all  the relevant Departments that links charities and community groups into a joint  strategy.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I strongly welcome the establishment of an  inter-ministerial group on domestic and sexual violence, which is chaired by  the Minister of Health and by the NIO. That group provides leadership and  ensures that we undertake joint work across the relevant Departments. The  group&rsquo;s regional, Tackling Sexual Violence and Abuse strategy, is also  extremely welcome and is intended to guide policy and service responses from  the healthcare, education and criminal justice systems.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The regional strategy focuses on three main areas that I  believe are critical if we are to make progress. Those areas are: prevention;  protection; and justice and support. The strategy also has an overarching  leadership and direction strand that will guide and help to co-ordinate policy.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I draw Members&rsquo; attention to the jointly funded 24-hour  domestic violence helpline, which provides information, advice and support to  all victims of domestic violence. I bring that helpline to the attention of all  those people who may be suffering, and I urge them to utilise it. I also note  the annual media campaign, which has resulted in more people contacting the  helpline.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We are moving in the right direction, and the Executive can  do much more to help people who need refuge and access to legal aid. However,  there is a framework in place with which we can work. I thank the Minister, who  will respond to today&rsquo;s debate, for facilitating that co-ordinating role. Along  with the Northern Ireland Office, his Department is playing a key role in  addressing the issue of domestic violence.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>: I  support the motion and thank the Members who brought it to the Floor.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Domestic violence is recognised as a major social problem  throughout the world. The real extent of the problem is unknown, because many  cases go unreported. I agree that the Executive must prioritise making access  to appropriate services and protection available to anyone who is a victim of  domestic violence.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Over the past 30 years, some distance has been travelled in  accepting that domestic violence exists. I pay tribute to everyone, such as  Women&rsquo;s Aid and others in the voluntary sector, who petitioned tirelessly for that  recognition, and for the funding to establish refuges.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In the past 10 years, inter-agency co-operation has  increased considerably, and an interdepartmental working group has been  established. In 2004, a regional steering group was set up with subgroups  focusing on children and young people, domestic violence, violence and the law,  and information. The Family Homes and Domestic Violence (Northern Ireland)  Order 1998 offers some protection through non-molestation and occupation  orders, particularly the exclusion order that forbids entrance to the home or  surrounding areas. The role of domestic violence officers in the PSNI has  developed, and local domestic violence partnerships have been established.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Despite all that progress, domestic violence remains a  problem. According to a report by the NIO and the Department of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety, &lsquo;Tackling Violence at Home&rsquo;, domestic violence:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;occurs right across our society and it has  devastating consequences for the victims&rdquo;.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The report emphasises the particularly devastating  effect on children, estimating:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;at least 11,000 children &hellip; are living with domestic  violence.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The report also contains the following statistics  on domestic violence:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;It accounts for one in five cases of violent crime  here &hellip; on average every year 5 people are killed &hellip; and about 700 families have  to be re-housed.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">It continues:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;On average every day in Northern Ireland, 12 women  and 4 men are victims of domestic-related assaults &hellip; it is estimated that one  in five women and one in nine men will experience domestic violence in the  course of their lifetime.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That violence will, most likely, be at the hands of  a partner.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As someone who has worked in the community and with victims  of domestic violence, I am aware that I am speaking too academically. As  mentioned, there are many facts, figures and statistics on domestic violence,  but every fact, figure and statistic represents someone who is crying out for  help. I wonder why some people use gratuitous violence: is it due to  inadequacy, a desire for control or simply badness, sometimes fuelled by  alcohol? A good Health Service here helps and heals, but gratuitous violence is  extremely challenging to address. It is extremely difficult always to keep the  people who are hurting and crying at the forefront of our minds, but domestic  violence affects people.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The domestic violence freephone helpline receives  approximately 20,000 calls a year, and many incidents, as Members know, are not  reported. &lsquo;Tackling Violence at Home&rsquo;, the paper published in October 2005, and  signed off by direct rule Ministers as current strategy, defines domestic  violence as:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;threatening behaviour, violence or abuse  (psychological, physical, verbal, sexual, financial or emotional) inflicted on  one person by another where they are or have been intimate partners or family  members, irrespective of gender or sexual orientation.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We have reached a stage where we must examine how we deal  with domestic violence. We must think particularly about the children who have,  perhaps, witnessed domestic violence and been rushed to a refuge by their  mother. Notwithstanding the violence, those children leave behind everything  that is familiar, including their friends, and they may have to change school  when they are vulnerable.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Other children may not have witnessed the violence. When  they are removed to a refuge, they do not understand why and become bewildered  and resentful.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member draw her remarks to a close?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>:  It is very important that there is access to the fathers. Furthermore, refuges  have no facilities for older teenagers; therefore, we must consider how they  can be looked after. There are so many issues, and I do not have time to go  into all of them, on which we need to do much more work to deal with this  issue.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">12.00 noon</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: I  thank the proposers of the motion for bringing what is a very important issue  back to the House. Domestic violence is an important issue, for not just the  Assembly, but for society and for those who are its victims. Underpinning the  debate around the issue must be a basic acceptance by everyone that the use, or  threat, of violence is unacceptable in any context. The fact that it takes  place behind closed doors does not excuse it in any way, nor does it lessen the  impact that it has on society. The Assembly must be united in sending out that  message today.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Domestic violence is also a complex and multifaceted issue.  It damages not only the target of the abuse, but it affects children, the wider  family, their community, their neighbours and their friends. We need to try to  tap into those wider networks in order to give people support, so that they  feel comfortable and safe in coming forward to report domestic violence.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Many Members have mentioned the statistics, and I apologise  for not having been able to be in the Chamber for all those speeches. I think  that the statistics show the tip of the iceberg, because many people do not  report domestic violence. Indeed, many people do not recognise the treatment  that they receive in their home as domestic violence. It is worth noting that  the formal definition of domestic violence is threatening behaviour, violence  or abuse on one person by another, where they are, or have been, intimate  partners or family members, irrespective of gender or sexual orientation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The use of, for example, threatening and controlling  behaviour is often underestimated, but it can be a way in which people  condition a victim to accept the abuse that is meted out to them. It is  important that people who are subjected to that kind of controlling and abusive  behaviour feel confident and secure in bringing it to the attention of the  appropriate authorities at an early stage.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  Does the Member agree that the recent high-profile case in which the judiciary  was seen to be lacking in sentencing for that very crime would not encourage  people to come forward voluntarily?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: I  agree with the Member that when sentencing seems to be light or inappropriate,  or when issues are not taken seriously enough, it is a major disincentive to  many people who are living with this problem in silence. It is also true when  people feel that their complaint is not taken seriously when they report it,  when there is not an adequate response, or when they feel that, having done everything  that they have been advised to do, they are often left high and dry with very  little support.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that people are not put in that position,  because we need to build confidence with those who are abused, so that, when  they come forward, their position will be taken seriously and action will be  taken to protect them, because, very often, when people present it is because  they are in fear of their lives. It does not send out a strong message to  people if they are back in the same situation a few months later, having  received little practical support. Therefore, I totally agree with the Member  on that point.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Northern Ireland Office crime survey indicated that 11%  of respondents aged 16 to 59 identified themselves as being victims of domestic  violence. Of those respondents, 15% were females and 9% were males.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The issue of domestic violence against men is often  overlooked, and it is significantly under-reported. We must be acutely aware of  that when we look at how we handle domestic violence and the construction of,  and arrangements for, support services. Men who are subjected to domestic abuse  often find it difficult to talk about, and they feel emasculated by what is  happening to them. Therefore, it is important that adequate time and effort is  put into ensuring that any mechanisms that are put in place to support victims  of domestic violence can cope with all victims of domestic violence. It is also  important that we send out the message to both men and women who have been  subjected to domestic abuse that it is not their fault.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">One of the very disturbing statistics that was highlighted  in the NIO&rsquo;s &lsquo;Experience of Domestic Violence: Findings from the 2007/2008  Northern Ireland Crime Survey&rsquo; was that 23% of female respondents reported  being the victim of threats and violence during pregnancy. The proposers of the  motion indicated their desire to assist vulnerable groups, and there can be no more  of a vulnerable group than that of unborn children; yet, they are being  subjected to stress and abuse while still in the womb. Indeed, it is horrific  to consider that someone would feel that they were in a position to abuse a  pregnant woman when most people feel that it should be a time to be protective  of a person. That is clearly very disturbing.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I visited a number of women&rsquo;s refuges, and I talked to a  number of women who have been subjected to violent and life-threatening abuse  from their spouses. As a result, I am conscious of the difficulty that those  women often have in being able to proceed through the civil courts because of  the cost involved.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member please draw her remarks to a close?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: It  is often the case that part of the abuse is in the control of finances.  Therefore, the need to pay for orders to keep the partner away from a victim  can be prohibitive. That must be addressed as a matter of urgency.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  As my colleague Ian McCrea intimated, the DUP supports the motion. However, as  one carefully reads it, it becomes clear that certain aspects could and should  have been added to it. For example, there should have been some reference that  acknowledged and further encouraged the role of the police. Indeed, I was  interested to hear what Basil McCrea had to say about the Policing Board taking  an interest in the issue of domestic violence. That does not in any way imply  that they were ever uninterested, but I know that it has an input.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The use of violence, either on or off the streets, is an  issue of importance to everyone. However it seems from reading the documents  that were placed at Members&rsquo; disposal that violence off the street, or domestic  violence, is treated differently from violence on the street. A judge recently  commented that he felt frustrated by the fact that legislation, in effect,  differentiated between domestic violence and an assault that takes place on the  street. He was also concerned by the continued insistence of the Public  Prosecution Service in sending summonses to perpetrators of domestic violence  by post rather than them being personally delivered and served, which therefore  does not command the immediate presence of the accused in court.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Thus, there is a differentiation between what happens in  the home and what happens on the street. However, I cannot understand why the  law should be different. I hope that as a result of today&rsquo;s debate, some of the  issues that have been articulated around the Chamber will be examined and that  some positive and decisive action will be taken.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I draw the attention of Members to some of the statistics  that have been placed before us. In preparation for today&rsquo;s debate, I reflected  on whether domestic violence was applicable across the entire spectrum in  Northern Ireland, and one very interesting statistic from the NIO&rsquo;s crime  survey shows that:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Respondents with a Protestant community background  (13%) were more likely to report having experienced domestic violence than  those with a Roman Catholic community background (9%).&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Right away one asks why that is the case, and that  is where I see a fundamental weakness in the motion. Does that say that there  is hesitancy from those from a Roman Catholic background to report domestic  violence to the police, whereas the same hesitancy does not persist in the  Protestant community?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If that is the case &mdash; and I will leave it to others to  decide whether it is &mdash; the motion should have acknowledged that there is a PSNI  dimension to the issue and that those who suffer from domestic violence should  not be reluctant in any way to call in the police to deal with the matter.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I think that it was Carmel Hanna who said that 11,000  children are affected by situations of domestic violence, and I am sure that  that statistic is somewhere in the notes that I have been given. It was good  that that point was brought out, because the children have to be protected as  much as the person who is being battered and at the receiving end of the  domestic violence. Therefore, the Assembly has to send out the strong message  that the elected representatives in the House will not differentiate and that they  want full co-operation on the issue with our policing authority, namely, the  PSNI. It is vital that that message goes out.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I support Lord Morrow&rsquo;s comments that the excellent work of the PSNI, which has  been recognised by Women&rsquo;s Aid and other bodies, should be recognised by all  Members. He raised the issue of statistics, but he may not know that there has  been a dramatic rise in reports of domestic abuse and domestic violence in  areas west of the Bann. Although one does not welcome the fact that such abuse  happens, one welcomes that it is reported. The community must report those  things to the police.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  I thank the Member for making those valuable points. He has drawn attention to  something that I turned up as he was speaking. The PSNI&rsquo;s statistical report  number 2, &lsquo;Domestic Incidents and Crimes, 1 April 2007 &mdash; 31 March 2008&rsquo; states  that:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;During 2007/08 more than two thirds of all crimes  with domestic motivation fell within the category of violent crime&hellip;There were  6,389 such offences, representing 68&middot;8% of the total. Of the remaining  offences, criminal damage accounted for 14&middot;9%&rdquo;.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That brings me to my earlier point.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Member to draw his remarks to a close.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  If those crimes of domestic violence are deemed as criminal, why are the  associated summonses delivered in a different way than those for street crime,  for instance? That should be looked at.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I agree with a great deal of what Lord Morrow said. In particular, I do not  understand sentencing policy. Everybody was shocked at the recent football  hooliganism and the effects of violence on our street. However, when such  violence takes place in the home, it seems that it is viewed on a different scale.  In such cases, we seem to be satisfied with suspended sentences or plea  bargaining, for instance, and I find that unacceptable.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to talk about the role of the Public Prosecution  Service, the victims and the reason that people do not feel able to come  forward and report crimes of domestic violence.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  Lord Morrow&rsquo;s comment was valid, but I think that the reporting of cases of  domestic violence requires that there is a trust and confidence in the Public  Prosecution Service (PPS) more so than in the PSNI. The issues that Basil  McCrea alluded to, such as the stigma that is felt by victims and the equality  of horror and how that is reflected in sentencing, are massive issues that need  to be tackled.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I am grateful to the Member for her intervention; I agree with her. I should  declare an interest as the chairperson of the human rights and professional  standards committee. Along with Women&rsquo;s Aid, the Rainbow Project and the Men&rsquo;s  Advisory Service, that committee spent a year looking at the issue of how the  police have got to grips with encouraging victims of domestic violence to come  forward. That has been one of the successes. All parties were represented, and  they did excellent work.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That is the key issue. People ask why victims do not come  forward. People are afraid that if they come forward, worse will happen to  them. We have to reassure people of whatever sex, religion, or background that  if they come forward and explain that there is a problem, society will protect  them.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The figures are shocking. It is said that one in four women  will be subject to some form of domestic abuse in their lifetime, but one in  nine men will also suffer such abuse, and that issue must be highlighted.  Problems are experienced also by people in same-sex relationships and by people  from the Travelling community. Those issues are under-reported because society  will not take them on.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n mentioned the PPS, and I challenge the PPS  to find a way of looking after victims properly. It is demeaning to victims to  go through a year-long court case only to be considered an adjunct or someone  who is almost simply a witness, to be unsure whether they will be called to  give evidence, and to be, in effect, subject to people plea-bargaining &mdash; we have  to change that. That is a challenge to the PPS and to the judiciary.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">When the time is right, the House should consider  establishing specialist courts with specialist lawyers and judges. We ask why  people do not resist violence or stay in a violent relationship for so long;  however, once we understand the complex psychological reasons, the issue will  become clearer. We must send an unequivocal message that we will not tolerate  violence against the most vulnerable members of our society.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Lord Morrow talked about equivalence and asked why it seems  that violence outside the home is regarded as more of a crime than violence  inside it. That argument could be taken a step further and it could be said  that there is a fundamental breakdown in trust when someone is used and abused  over many years in their home, which should be their sanctuary. That is what  makes domestic abuse all the more heinous.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: I  support what the Member is saying, but an important point that may not yet have  been touched upon is the importance of preventative work. Education, school  programmes and informal education in a youth group can be used to teach young  people about relationships, violence and respect for one&rsquo;s partner.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I agree with Ms Lo: the perpetrators of domestic abuse do not think that they  have done anything wrong. They do not see the moral argument; they think that  their behaviour is OK, but it is not OK. There must be a huge sentence for  those people &mdash; we must get the sentencing right and send a clear message in the  only language that they understand.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We must also look at non-molestation orders. Do people  realise that it costs between &pound;500 and &pound;600 to obtain such an order? One of the  advances that the Policing Board has made is that it will now report separately  on those issues so that breaking a non-molestation order will be regarded as a  crime. In conclusion, this an area in which we can work collectively to do some  good. I want the Assembly collectively to send a clear and unequivocal message  that domestic violence against anyone is totally unacceptable.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  I support the motion. The issues detailed in the motion have been addressed  very well by previous Members, so, conscious of time and the complexity of the  issue, I will focus primarily on the perpetrators of violence and the impact of  violence on families.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Possibly the most tragic aspect of domestic violence, which  was highlighted by Mrs Hanna, is that more than 11,000 children in Northern  Ireland will witness or be subject to domestic violence. Despite the existence  of the inter-departmental group and strategy, every day the police receive  about 60 reports of domestic abuse. To date, attention has been primarily on  adult victims, but there is a need to focus also on tackling the perpetrators  of domestic abuse, both in relation to the rigor of the law and possible  treatment. Priority must be given to instances when the perpetrators of  domestic violence are parents, given the potential risk that they can pose to  the children who are in their homes.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>:  Anna Lo referred to the importance of education. Does the Member accept that  often those who abuse and who are abused are conditioned by their experiences  of watching other relationships around them? That allows them to accept such a  relationship as normal for much longer than for many of those who have not had  those experiences, and, therefore, the support and counselling to which the  Member refers are absolutely critical?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  I agree with the Member. It is a huge issue for those who have experienced or  witnessed domestic violence in their homes.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The issues of power and control are at the root of domestic  abuse and violence, and those are most unlikely to begin and end with a  partner. Research shows that children who live in a domestic violence setting  are also likely to suffer physical abuse or are at a much higher risk of sexual  abuse. Recent tragedies such as the McElhill fire tragedy in Omagh highlight  the need for all the appropriate agencies to listen to children&rsquo;s concerns  about domestic violence.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Although I do not want to detract from the excellent work  being done by the PSNI, an issue that has been raised, and is of concern, is  the fact that reporting of domestic abuse has been removed as a specific  performance indicator from the Policing Plan 2009-2012. In a report published  earlier this month, the human rights and professional standards committee of  the Northern Ireland Policing Board expressed concerns about the reporting of  domestic abuse and about how statistics were gathered, and it indicated that  any report of a domestic abuse incident should flag up whether a child or  children might be at risk.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  The Member points out various issues. However, I want to reassure her that  domestic abuse is referred to on page 13 of the Policing Plan: it is a high  priority. The specific issue of reporting to which the Member refers will be  discussed at next week&rsquo;s Policing Board meeting, when there will be a full  report from the deputy chief constable as part of a six-month campaign. It will  provide all the statistics that the Member needs, and I am sure that she will  join me in welcoming the report.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  I thank the Member for that additional information. I welcome the report, its  outcomes and any impact that it may have.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Even if perpetrators of domestic abuse are convicted and  are parents, serious concerns remain about the contact that they will have with  their children. Perpetrators could be convicted of grievous bodily harm and  receive a suspended sentence, yet no assessment will be made in relation to  their parenting or the contact that they have with their children.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Barnardo&rsquo;s provides services to children who have  experienced domestic violence, and there are serious concerns that children are  often placed in unsafe situations. It is essential that the courts recognise  the impact of a perpetrator&rsquo;s domestic violence on children and assess a  perpetrator&rsquo;s future contact on the basis of that risk.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Although a non-abusive parent in a domestic violence setting  will often have had his or her parenting assessed by social services, a  perpetrator will often not have. Unfortunately, there is no process or service  in Northern Ireland where that can take place. That undermines the safety of  children and reduces the impact of convictions. Indeed, women are often  expected to manage child contact with a former violent partner themselves.  There is an urgent need for perpetrators to have their parenting assessed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, courts must take account of the impact of  domestic violence on contact situations and develop a model for assessing the  perpetrator&rsquo;s parenting and risk factors. There is only one course available in  Northern Ireland for perpetrators of domestic violence that is aimed at  addressing their behaviour, and it is available only to those who have been  convicted. It is not available to those who have not been convicted but want to  change their behaviour voluntarily. The course has a 30% completion rate. There  is no current assessment of the extent to which the abusive behaviour is likely  to change or its impact on their parenting.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is vital to recognise that domestic violence is a crime  and deserves a tough response from the criminal justice system. There is also  the need for a service that can provide access to treatment that will seek to  ensure long-term changes in behaviour, and it must be available to those who  are convicted and those who wish to engage voluntarily.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We must ensure that the victims of domestic violence are  not made to suffer further and that the non-abusive parent and children are not  made to leave the family home, if that can be prevented. Therefore, I support  the extension of the provision of safe rooms, not only to those in public  housing but to owner-occupiers. It is time to focus on the needs of children &mdash;  not only while the perpetrator is in the family home but after he or she has  left &mdash; and to address the real and serious risks to children of a parent who is  a perpetrator of domestic violence.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  Between April 2007 and March 2008, 34 incidents of domestic violence were  reported every week in my constituency of Foyle; the police told us that that  is only the tip of the iceberg. Domestic violence can range from minor assaults  through to murder. In order to encompass the wide aspects of the crime, the  terminology was changed to &ldquo;domestic abuse&rdquo;.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Domestic abuse is not just a single action &mdash; it is the  beginning of, or another episode in, a living hell for the victim that gives  them a horrible life that nobody deserves. Women whom I would have perceived as  strong individuals have been reduced to nervous wrecks who only exist excuse by  excuse to cover the hideous pain and suffering that is inflicted upon them by  an abusive partner.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Domestic abuse is not always a physical attack; sometimes,  the mind games and psychological torture are more damaging. In half of the  cases, the children of the victims are also ill-treated. It is a crime that is  not restricted by class or creed, and it is a crime that is often silent and  hidden by the victim themselves.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">This Assembly has an objective to make things better for  the people of Northern Ireland. For one in four women in Northern Ireland that  means providing effective support mechanisms to allow them to have the  confidence to get out of that hell. That act requires tremendous courage and  enormous strength that sometimes cannot be summoned by the victim alone. If  they go it alone, the realisation of what they have done can often prove too  much, and they are desperate for help and support at that stage. If the  Assembly cannot help the lead organisations to provide the proper support  mechanisms for those victims, it will have failed in one of its most basic  objectives.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Women&rsquo;s Aid &mdash; which is the lead voluntary organisation in  Northern Ireland &mdash; is desperate to help to eradicate all forms of domestic  abuse. It tries to achieve that by using educational programmes that are aimed  at preventative measures by teaching equality and respect in all relationships.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The 7% increase in statistics from 2006 to 2007 is chilling  to say the least. From 2007 to 2008, the fact that the PSNI responded to a  domestic incident every 23 minutes can scarcely be comprehended. It is not only  about supporting families who are in crisis; it could be a case of life or  death. We require a cross-departmental strategy that, in the first instance,  can identify the signs of abuse and then act upon them &mdash; whether through its  departmental sections or by providing support to properly constituted and  experienced organisations.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">To listen, as I have done, to a woman who is or has been a  victim of domestic abuse is a sobering and frightening experience. The threat  of financial ruin or the worry of how they will be able to care and provide for  their children are all mental flash cards that scare them away from making the  decision to leave. The initial loss of confidence, which is common to all the  victims, is really only a heartbeat away from loss of life. That was a  heartbreaking reality for the families of 44% of murder victims in Northern  Ireland in 2007-08.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Some victims, even if they are employed, cannot afford to  protect themselves with a non-molestation order as it is too expensive. The  combined cost of both stages of such an order can be up to &pound;800.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A victim is changed forever: their lives are scarred beyond  the understanding of those of us who are lucky enough to have healthy  relationships. They are certainly changed emotionally, and sometimes they are  changed physically, depending on the type of abuse that was meted out to them.  Abuse or a suspicion of abuse can now be reported by any concerned person.  Since the legislation was changed last year, the report does not have to come  from the victim. I urge anyone who has a suspicion to report it.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  The Member may be interested to know that part of the police direction is now  that any suspicion of domestic abuse must be followed through. If there is any  suggestion that people could be let off with a caution, it must be noted why a  charge was not progressed. The maximum charge possible must be pressed rather  than one that would secure an easy conviction.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  I thank the Member for that welcome information.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, I urge anyone who has suspicions that domestic  violence is taking place to report it. That action could save a life. It may be  that that one phone call or that one approach is enough for victims to break  their silence finally and admit that they are, indeed, victims. When, and if,  they do that, we must ensure that the correct strategies and support systems  are in place to help and encourage victims, whether male or female, to build a  new and better life for themselves and their children. I support the motion.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has arranged to meet immediately upon the  lunchtime suspension. I therefore propose, by leave of the Assembly, to suspend  the sitting until 2.00 pm.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The sitting was suspended at 12.30 pm.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">On resuming (Mr Deputy Speaker <span class="Italic">[Mr  Dallat]</span> in the Chair) &mdash;</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I am pleased to be called to speak on the motion. This is an important issue,  and the fact that the Chamber is not full and bursting with people does not  take away from that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is an epidemic of domestic violence in Northern  Ireland, and as elected representatives, every one of us can express that  clearly. It is estimated that one in four women in the Province have been  physically abused by a partner. In the majority of cases, it is found that  alcohol misuse is the key factor. These are not isolated events.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Domestic violence is often hidden behind closed doors, as  many women feel too ashamed to talk about it and are made to feel responsible  for the abuse. The only way to break the taboo is to ensure that the subject is  discussed properly and that the appropriate blame is laid on the correct  shoulders. I am glad that the motion has been brought before the Assembly  today; we need to show both victims and perpetrators that this awful crime is  not a secret, that people are aware that it happens and that it is unacceptable  in Northern Ireland. The shame lies on the shoulders of those who inflict their  anger towards other people, which is the message that domestic violence  charities strive to send out.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Here bes the crux o&rsquo; the matther &ndash; domestic violence bes a  vicious cycle at happens agin an&rsquo; agin. An owre affen, quhan thaim at ir abused  heid tae a shelter &ndash; they ir apt tae gae beck tae the abuser.

Thon&rsquo;s where A wud agin urge  Depairtments tae mak&rsquo; siccar at unnerspend bes announced sae catter can gae tae  projects laike the fecht agin domestic violence.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The crux of the matter is that domestic violence is a  vicious and repetitive circle. All too often, people who have been abused go to  a shelter but then return to their abuser. Charities try to provide a support  network, but there must be ring-fenced funding to ensure that charities such as  Women&rsquo;s Aid have the money to provide systems and networks that operate full  time with trained and up-to-date volunteers who know how best to get the  message through to the victim. I again urge Departments to ensure that  underspends are announced so that money can be allocated to projects such as  the fight against domestic violence.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A new public protection unit has recently been set up in my  constituency of Strangford to deal with domestic violence and child abuse.  There are very sensitive issues involving child abuse and protection, domestic  violence and abuse, vulnerable and missing people and the need for violent and  sexual offenders to be managed in the community. There is clear evidence of  links between domestic abuse and child abuse, and my colleague Michelle  McIlveen, among others, referred to that this morning.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There are examples of children running away to avoid  physical and sexual abuse and, in many cases, the abuser&rsquo;s power over his or  her victim leads to crimes not being reported to the police and evidence being  hard to obtain. The creators of public protection units seek to identify links  between cases and provide specialist support to victims and witnesses. We need  funding in order to provide that support, which is needed across the Province.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am happy to join with all other Members of the Assembly  in saying that we are aware of domestic violence. We will do everything in our  power as an Assembly, and as elected representatives, to eradicate the horrible  statistic of one in four women in the Province having been abused. We are  sending the message that it is never OK for someone to use their fists against  a vulnerable person, whether that vulnerable person is a child, a woman or a  man. I support the motion and the fight against all forms of domestic abuse in  all homes.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  I, too, support the very valuable motion. My party and I believe that there is  no excuse, explanation or justification for domestic violence in any of its  forms, whether it is actual violence, threatened physical violence, sexual  assault, damage to property or the much more sinister non-physical  intimidation, such as persistent verbal abuse, emotional blackmail and enforced  social and financial deprivation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Domestic violence can take all those forms and many more.  According to figures released by the Department of Health, Social Services and  Public Safety, every day in Northern Ireland, 12 women and four men experience  domestic violence. Alarmingly, one in five women and one in nine men will  experience domestic violence at some stage in their lives.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is deeply disturbing that at least 11,000 children in  Northern Ireland live in proximity and close association with daily domestic  violence; no child deserves or should have to put up with that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As a GP in a previous existence, I have seen the serious  long-term damage that domestic violence does to the victim &mdash; male or female,  adult or child. I have witnessed the physical and mental suffering that they  are forced to go through; the humiliation and the degradation; the low  self-esteem, the depression, the mental misery and the sense of being totally  trapped &mdash; all of which leave serious mental scars, and perhaps physical scars  as well. I have also seen how domestic violence can completely destroy young  lives and young dreams.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Many children who live with violence in their homes end up  suffering severe mental-health problems and other illnesses. They also suffer  educational underachievement and a sense of marginalisation, and they often  wander down the dangerous road of crime, antisocial behaviour and drug abuse.  They often have an inability to form positive, healthy, constructive personal  relationships.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A considerable amount of good work is done by support  groups and community organisations, such as Women&rsquo;s Aid, in tackling domestic  violence; however, more support could be provided if funding streams were more  consistent and secure. The reporting of domestic violence to the PSNI has  increased, but there is still significant under-reporting. Far too many people  continue to suffer in silence. Women suffer for the sake of their children, and  children suffer trying to keep the family together and often blame themselves  for the anger, conflict and violence between their parents.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If we are serious about doing what we can to end this  scourge on our society, we must develop a robust cross-departmental approach to  supporting people in such circumstances. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s plans, but I  remain to be convinced that they will produce the necessary results and I urge  the Executive &mdash; not just the Minister &mdash; to consult all the essential support  organisations and victims to develop what we need: a robust system, adequately  funded, pro-active and cross-departmental in outlook. This is not exclusively  an issue for the Department of Health. Its Minister may lead on the issue, but  it spills over into the responsibility of other agencies and Departments.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We could learn much from Scotland where a framework is in  the advanced stages of development. A key part of our strategy must involve  putting in place adequate support structures for victims, providing refuge  accommodation and legal aid to empower victims to end abuse in their  relationships. It should also be about changing attitudes and educating adults  and children to know that domestic violence &mdash; wherever it occurs &mdash; is wrong,  unacceptable and that there is help available to put a stop to it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">To suffer domestic violence and live in continual fear from  a partner, parent or child is unimaginable to many of us, but it is reality for  many people. An end must be put to that reality, the victim could be your  relative or mine, your neighbour or mine. We cannot and must not stand back and  ignore what goes on behind closed doors. Helping to end the despicable domestic  violence that goes on might cost a small amount of money but, in the end, it  will be worth it to improve the quality of many lives.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member please bring his remarks to a close?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  I support the motion.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: We,  of course, support the motion. Its subject is very important, and I  congratulate the proposer and her colleagues for bringing it back to the  Assembly.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I do not want to repeat statistics, although it is very  difficult not to repeat things when you are around seventeenth in the pecking  order. However, one statistic that did jump out at me is that 23% of pregnant  women are being abused by their husbands. I find that absolutely astonishing.  That statistic is probably not even correct given that so many of those crimes  go unreported. It is absolutely unbelievable. It makes me wonder what sort of  society we have bred that allows such a statistic to be upheld.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It makes me wonder, too, about the rest of the statistics  that have been mentioned. Surely, they are all under-representative given the  failure and reluctance of women &mdash; I should say men as well, and perhaps  particularly men &mdash; to report that type of crime. Basil McCrea said that good  statistics mean good politics. I was not quite sure what he meant by that.  However, if he meant that good statistics are a basis for formulating good law  and good practices, I would agree with him.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Over the years, I have known, factually and anecdotally, of  cases of domestic violence. I have never had anybody come into my constituency  office to make that sort of complaint, and I would not expect that. However, of  the cases that I have known about &mdash; of which there are quite a number &mdash; not one  has been reported to the police. One case involved a lady who had a broken  cheekbone and was badly bruised. She left her husband for six months but then  went back to him. That says something about relationships. In a lot of cases,  it is not the fear of retribution or of a repeat offence that prevents people  from reporting domestic violence to the police, but the fear of social stigma.  That is perhaps especially true in the upper echelons of society where domestic  violence is every bit as prevalent as is it among the working class. There is a  loyalty factor as well.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There are differences in the punishments for domestic  violence and incidences of violence outside the home. Violence is violence and  an assault is an assault. Both are crimes that have to be punished. However, it  is hardly a surprise to me that, on some occasions, judges are more lenient in  cases of domestic violence. If there was clear evidence of a wish for  reconciliation, if a wife who had been violently assaulted spoke for her  husband, if she made it clear that it was the first time, and he made it clear  that it would be the last time, frankly, if I were a judge, I would take note  of that. Although the crime may be the same, perhaps there are occasions when  the punishment is different.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It was, I think, Basil McCrea who said that there should  perhaps be a slightly different legal process for those types of case. I do not  have the answer; however, I wonder whether a different system &mdash; something a bit  less formal and a bit less expensive &mdash; could be brought into play. Perhaps  somebody has an idea about that. In all those cases, I wonder whether the full  rigour of the law &mdash; in open court and in public &mdash; is really the way to go.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is no statistic that I can find to indicate how many  of the 23,000 cases reported each year led to a breakdown of the relationship.  I suspect that the number of total relationship breakdowns is a small  percentage of that figure. That makes me think that, in a lot of cases, the  couple wants to maintain the relationship. I doubt whether we will ever see  statistics for that. Perhaps a more conciliatory and arbitration-based approach  might have some effect.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I apologise for coming into the House towards the end of the Member&rsquo;s  contribution.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">He asked a specific question. There are 30,000 cases;  10,000 are criminal in the sense that they are proceeded with. Of those 10,000  cases, 7,000 are violent crimes. Although domestic violence is totally  underreported, it still represents 25% of all violent crime. Those are huge  figures. I agree with the Member that a different way of dealing with that must  be found, but the figures are quite shocking.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: We  still do not know how many of those cases lead to a total marriage or  relationship breakdown.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party agrees with the motion, and the way in  which it deplores violence. We totally agree that full access to refuge  facilities is essential and that correct funding be provided for support groups  and for any legal action. It is absolutely deplorable that a woman &mdash; I refer to  women for simplicity &mdash; who is under such a threat of violence that she has to  take her husband or partner to court does not receive legal aid for the  prosecution yet he does for his defence. That is outrageous, and perhaps it is  a case for a ministry of policing and justice to be devolved to Northern Ireland  so that we can do something about it.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: Domestic violence  and abuse is a serious problem and has a devastating impact on the lives of  victims and their families. In Northern    Ireland, it has reached disturbing levels.  Statistics show that 11,000 children here live with domestic violence on a  daily basis. Every year, six people, mostly women, are killed, and more than  700 families have to be re-housed as a result of violence in the home. Every week,  the police attend over 400 domestic violence incidents and deal with more than  100 domestic assaults on women and men. Recent statistics show that in 2007-08,  23,000 such incidents were reported to the police.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Victims are often reluctant to pursue a case through the  courts because of concerns about the consequences of a prosecution and the  impact that it might have on the family. Family members are reluctant to see a  relative being sent to jail or to see the break-up of a family.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Such violent abuse affects people across society from all  walks of life. Trevor Lunn spoke of working-class families, but the problem  goes right across society. The vast majority of victims are women, but a number  are men.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Violence in the home also has a particular impact on the development  of children, who are very much the silent victims. The long-term effects on  children who suffer or witness domestic violence can lead to significant problems.  Juvenile crime, poor educational achievement, substance misuse, mental-health  problems and homelessness are just some of the consequences for child victims  of violence in the home.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The economic impact is quite staggering. About &pound;180 million  each year is the cost of domestic violence in Northern Ireland when the cost of  services such as police, courts, health and social services and the loss of  economic output is counted.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The cross-departmental strategy for addressing domestic  violence in Northern Ireland,  Tackling Violence at Home, was launched in 2005. The strategy aims to tackle  domestic violence under the three key strands of prevention, protection, and  justice and support. It is helping all the voluntary and statutory agencies to  develop a consistent and long-term approach to the prevention of domestic  violence and to produce an effective response where it is needed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Action plans have been produced, and a regional steering  group has been established to ensure that the plans are implemented rapidly and  effectively. Five local domestic violence partnerships support people at a  community level and bring together local groups and Government to help to  tackle this scourge. The police and justice agencies, along with the Social  Security Agency and housing agencies, have a responsibility to ensure that victims  and their families get the necessary protection, financial help and  accommodation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;calls on the Executive to bring forward proposals to  ensure full access to refuge for persons affected&rdquo;.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">It is certainly my intention that appropriate support  services and refuges are available for victims of domestic violence. The  Department for Social Development&rsquo;s (DSD) Supporting People initiative, through  the Housing Executive, has played a crucial part in the provision of emergency  refuge and temporary accommodation for those who suffer domestic violence. It  also helps the voluntary sector to provide a range of other services to  victims.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Ensuring that victims have a safe place to go when they are  affected by violence is crucial. There are currently 17 women&rsquo;s refuges and  move-on schemes that provide 148 family and single accommodation units for  victims and children who have fled domestic violence. They are supported by DSD  with funding of just over &pound;3 million each year. In addition, &pound;1 million is  allocated through Supporting People to floating support services &mdash; an important  support mechanism for women and their families who do not live in refuges.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is absolutely no doubt that refuges are needed for  victims of violence who are forced to flee violent homes. They are safe havens  that are free from harm and abuse, where families can rebuild their lives and  make decisions about their future. Why, though, should families and children  who have endured domestic violence face even greater distress by being forced  to leave their home? It is the violent abuser who should leave. Children must  be given every opportunity to remain in the familiar surroundings of their home  and to stay in their local school with their friends.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Greater protection and support is now available for  families who wish to stay at home. Changes have been made to the law and to  improve enforcement of non-molestation, occupation and restraining orders.  Those are aimed at helping families to remain and feel safe in their own homes.  Last year, the Housing Executive piloted a sanctuary scheme, which provides a  room where a victim and her children can be safe in their own home. The scheme  is now being extended across Northern    Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Housing Executive and registered social landlords can  now repossess properties from tenants whose co-habitants have been driven out  by domestic violence or threats of violence. That could help victims to return  to their family home. I want that protection to be strengthened, so that more  and more families are able to remain safely in their homes.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">To achieve that would be a major challenge for Government.  We must face up to that challenge if we are to tackle the problem of domestic  violence in our society. With funding from my Department, the Northern Ireland  Office and the Housing Executive, the Women&rsquo;s Aid Federation operates a 24-hour  free-phone service, which is open to anyone who is affected by domestic  violence. That helpline provides vital support and advice for victims of  violence. In 2007-08, more than 24,000 calls were received.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Under the protection and justice strand of the strategy,  there have been a number of developments in support of victims. Police have  greater powers of arrest for domestic violence. In addition, there are  increased penalties for breach of protection orders. Work is being undertaken  by the Legal Services Commission as part of its reform programme to examine how  access to justice for victims of domestic violence can be improved.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">On the prevention front, we must get the message across to  everyone that domestic violence is never acceptable. Public-information  campaigns, using television, radio and poster advertisements, have focused on  encouraging those who are suffering violence and abuse to end their silence.  The current campaign focuses on perpetrators of domestic violence, making it  clear that they are committing a crime and that they can be prosecuted, even if  the victim is too scared to testify or give evidence.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">When I addressed the House in May 2007, I undertook to  raise the profile of domestic violence and to secure the commitment of  ministerial colleagues to give the issue the priority that it deserves. I have  done that by setting up an inter-ministerial group on domestic and sexual  violence, which held its first meeting last year. Its next meeting is planned  for 6 May 2009. The group aims to provide local leadership and to ensure joint working  across Government to tackle domestic violence.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I also gave a commitment to secure extra money to support  victims, and was successful in getting an extra &pound;200,000 per annum. That  funding is being used to deliver educational programmes for children and young  people, and counselling for victims. Research shows that 30% of domestic  violence starts during pregnancy. Abused women have higher rates of miscarriage,  stillbirths, premature labours and injuries to the foetus.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In 2006, my Department introduced a policy to ensure that  expectant mothers are asked about domestic violence when they attend routine  antenatal clinics. Work is ongoing to extend that provision to victims through  A&amp;E units and doctors&rsquo; surgeries.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The strategy and its associated plans are facilitating many  other initiatives. Barnardo&rsquo;s delivers awareness training and mentoring for  Health Service staff, and the Men&rsquo;s Advisory Project provides counselling and  anger-management services. By the end of March, approx&shy;imately 1,200 sessions  will have been delivered. Moreover, the NSPCC delivers support services for  children who suffer domestic violence, and approx&shy;imately 1,600 support  sessions will have been delivered to mothers and their children by the end of  March.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, Women&rsquo;s Aid offers education programmes to  schoolchildren to teach them about healthy, non-violent relationships. In  2007-08, more than 7,200 children took part in those programmes. Guidance was  distributed to MLAs and MPs to help them to better identify victims of domestic  violence and provide information on the available support services. Staff from  the Court Service and the Public Prosecution Service have received special  training in order to make that process less intimidating for victims of  domestic violence.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have provided funding for the roll-out of the  multi-agency risk assessment conference in Northern Ireland. That proven  process will help to identify victims of domestic violence who are at greatest  risk of harm and will establish a plan to ensure their safety. Nine staff will  be involved in that process at a cost of &pound;300,000 a year. That is jointly  funded by the Department and the Northern Ireland Office. Those staff will be  located in police public-protection units and will work with social workers, probation  officers and others in order to identify and support high-risk victims.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have included two targets that relate to domestic  violence in the Department&rsquo;s priorities for action for 2010 and have ensured  that domestic violence targets are included in the Northern Ireland policing plan. I wrote  to Paul Goggins some time ago and he responded by assuring me that he would  include those targets in the policing plan. Although Michelle McIlveen said  earlier that such targets are not in the plan, Basil McCrea confirmed that they  are included in the policing plan for 2009-2012, which will be published soon.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Jennifer McCann mentioned legal aid. That is matter for the  Northern Ireland Office and the Court Service. However, the Legal Services  Commission is revisiting that matter. Mervyn Storey asked whether GP practices  keep a record of the gender of victims who visit them with complaints of  domestic violence. GPs do not keep specific statistics on domestic violence  disclosures, because victims do not tend to go to GPs about incidents of  domestic violence.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have previously discussed the pilot integrated family  court scheme. Under the current domestic violence action plan, the Northern  Ireland Court Service is taking the lead on that matter and will introduce  proposals for a pilot integrated family court. Such schemes work successfully  in England  and ensure that victims do not have to continually return to court for court  orders or for applications for custody or exclusions. That is an important  issue that goes to the heart of where we need to be.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Although it is difficult for the authorities to protect  families inside their own homes, we need to strive to do so. As Members have  said repeatedly, violent attacks in the home must be treated in the same way as  those that happen outside the home. The success of that idea will depend on  good policing and equipping the police and the Court Service to support  victims. Family courts offer a real opportunity for progress and could ensure  that perpetrators receive the punishment that they deserve. That is an  important way forward.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We have made progress on domestic violence. Nowadays, no  one suggests that domestic violence should be kept within the home and that the  authorities should not become involved in domestic disputes between husbands  and wives. About 10 or 20 years ago, such garden wisdom was common. Everyone in  society now understands that it is totally unacceptable and that the  authorities will continue to reinforce the existing remedies.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Working together, we must make domestic violence absolutely  unacceptable and ensure that appropriate resources are in place to provide  support for victims.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">2.30 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Those who suffer domestic violence must be encouraged to  seek the help that they need and end the silence. We all have a part to play in  achieving that.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank all the Members who  contributed to this important debate. I have just carried out a rough count,  and I think that 19 Members made a contribution to the debate, either through  making a speech or by interventions.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Minister for being here and welcome what he said  about how to address the issue and about raising its profile. I will first make  a few points of my own, and then I will refer to other Members&rsquo; contributions;  each and every contribution from Members today was exceptionally valuable.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Members referred to the key findings of the Northern  Ireland crime survey for 2007-08, but they are worth repeating: one in 10  respondents was a victim of domestic violence; respondents from a Protestant  background were more likely to report than respondents from a Catholic  background; some 27% of victims believed that their worst incident had been  seen and/or heard by children; and 42% of respondents perceived that the Government  and their agencies, such as the police and the courts, were doing too little to  address the problem of domestic violence.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have selected those particular key findings because,  having listened to the debate, I think that they underpin the contributions of  Members &mdash; not entirely, but they encompass the thrust of the contributions that  were made.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  I am reluctant to take interventions, because I am going to comment on what  each Member said. If there is time after I have made all my own points, I will  give way.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">My colleague Jennifer McCann, who opened the debate,  provided a stark statistic on which a number of Members commented. One quarter  of all women experience domestic violence in their lives; that is a frightening  statistic. A second statistic referred to by Jennifer McCann is that 11,000  children have experienced domestic violence; most Members referred to that  statistic. That is important, and I will repeat it: 11,000 children have  experienced domestic abuse.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is difficult to comprehend the implications of that,  which include problems at school. Research shows that experiencing violence at  home has damaging and devastating effects on children at school and in later  life. We heard from Members that that is a problem; if someone experiences  domestic violence in early life, it tends to be repeated in adult life.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Ian McCrea commended Women&rsquo;s Aid, as did other Members. He  gave a graphic account of a case in his constituency, and referred to the good  work that was done by Women&rsquo;s Aid in Cookstown. He said that the woman involved  in that case had no house for herself and her children and that the children  ended up in care. That is a serious situation, but the Minister spoke about how  the housing situation might be resolved.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">John McCallister used the phrase &ldquo;blight on our society&rdquo;,  with which I agree. He spoke about the PSNI having to respond to incidents of  domestic violence every 23 minutes, and he also made reference to the Northern  Ireland Office and the Health Department working together.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">He also talked about the difficulties that pregnant women  in these situations face. We do not need to go into details, but it is  horrifying to think about pregnant women and their unborn children being  abused.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Carmel Hanna has worked with victims of domestic abuse and  has first-hand knowledge of the problem. She talked about the children, and she  asked why abusers do what they do. She said that this was a challenge, and I  concur with that. I do not believe that we understand fully the reason that  domestic violence happens.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Naomi Long began her contribution by saying that this was a  very important issue. We all agree with that, and as I have said repeatedly,  the contributions from Members underline that. She highlighted the fact that  domestic abuse takes place behind closed doors, and she drew attention to the  silence that surrounds it. That paints a particular picture that must be  addressed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Several Members, including Mrs Long, talked about  sentencing and said that it was in no way encouraging. It is not encouraging;  the evidence and the experience to show that are there. Who is actually being  sentenced? We must recognise that, very often, the initial victim, and not the  perpetrator, is sentenced. The Minister said that attempts were being made to  address that situation. Members of the Policing Board also addressed that issue.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Lord Morrow made particular reference to one key finding in  statistics when he talked about the difference in numbers between Catholics and  Protestants reporting domestic violence to the PSNI. He said that the statistics  pointed in a particular direction. I selected that key finding myself, and  there are many reasons that the statistics show that there is a higher rate of  reporting of domestic violence from the Protestant community. I reassure Lord  Morrow that we are all trying to build confidence. We are trying to build  confidence in my side of the community so that people can feel that they can go  to the PSNI. As elected Members, we encourage them to do that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Lord Morrow used the word &ldquo;battered&rdquo; when he talked about  victims of domestic violence. Again, that was very graphic and very telling. He  wondered why, if the violence happens in the home, it is treated one way by the  judiciary and sentenced accordingly, but if it happens in the street, it is  dealt with differently. The Member for Lagan Valley Basil McCrea also talked  about building confidence, and he supported Lord Morrow&rsquo;s comments. As a member  of the Policing Board, Basil McCrea is able to raise the issues in the place  where they should be dealt with properly.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Michelle McIlveen talked about the problem from a different  angle, and she focused her contribution on what must be done about  perpetrators. She made a valuable point, and she mentioned a case in my  constituency and what flowed from it. She said that perpetrators often remain  in the situation where they can continue to harm. I am not sure that that is  being addressed fully. I know that some measures have been put in place as a  result of that case in my constituency, and we must ensure that such work  continues.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mary Bradley talked about the figures in Foyle and about  the price of a non-molestation order. She has experience of that in her  constituency, and we can all relate to that. Jim Shannon talked about the one  in four women who have been the victims of domestic abuse, and he related many  of those cases to problems with alcohol. He supported the funding for Women&rsquo;s  Aid and its work. Dr McDonnell described the motion as valuable. He emphasised  the work of Women&rsquo;s Aid and reiterated the fact that 11,000 children are  affected by domestic abuse.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Trevor Lunn also mentioned the statistics on reporting  instances of domestic abuse to the police. That issue is being addressed  slowly. He wondered about legal aid, and the Minister referred to that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Minister McGimpsey spoke about how devastating domestic  abuse is for communities and families. Certainly, this issue is a challenge for  all of the bodies. My party tabled this motion, and we very much welcome, and  are pleased with, today&rsquo;s contributions. We all are saying the same kinds of  things &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member bring her remarks to a close?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  The challenge in dealing with the issue remains. Go raibh maith agat, a  LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly deplores any instance of domestic violence  and its implications for children, young people and vulnerable adults; calls on  the Executive to bring forward proposals to ensure full access to refuge for  persons affected and to address the issue of access to legal aid for vulnerable  families; and further calls for adequate funding for the relevant support  groups and community organisations in their campaigns and work in tackling  domestic violence.</p>
      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="5" id="5"></a>Private Members&rsquo; Business</p>
      <p class="H4StageHeading">All-Party Assembly Group on Autism</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to two hours for the  debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes to propose and 10  minutes to make a winding-up speech. All other Members who wish to speak will  have five minutes.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly expresses its concern at the high rate of  autism and the consequent development challenges to Government and  non-Government agencies across health, education and social care; and commends  the United Nations designation of 2 April as world autism awareness day and the  invitation to all Member States to observe this day annually to raise public  awareness of autism.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm  an r&uacute;n &aacute;irithe seo a mholadh. On behalf of the all-party Assembly group on  autism, I am pleased to propose today&rsquo;s motion.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is no doubt that autism is being recognised as a  global human rights issue. The United Nations designation, which is referenced  in the motion, places autism in a group of issues that requires a united push  to break down the barriers that have been created by years of neglect and  inequality in each member state.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">For example, in Northern Ireland, since 2002, we  have witnessed prevalence rates of autism rise from four in 10,000 to 71 in  10,000 and further, to one in 100. That equals 20,000 people locally with  autistic spectrum disorder (ASD), and, if one counts their families, the lives  of 68,000 people are touched day and daily by autism. That is a huge number of  people.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The increase in autism among the school-age population from  900 to 4,000 cases among children and young people reflects a staggering 400%  rise in only six years. That is due to the systemic lack of investment and  cannot be explained solely by improved identification. Autism is recognised  globally as the fastest rising disability, and research indicates that unmet  need is causing the highest rates of mental stress in the disability sector.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Despite that evidence &mdash; and the obvious pressure and  challenges that are faced by those families and providers, hundreds of whom  gathered outside this Building today &mdash; services, policies, legislation and  awareness have remained underfunded, underdeveloped and under-researched at  Government level.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In commending the motion, I call on the Executive to take  forward the first Northern Ireland ASD awareness campaign in direct response to  the sentiments expressed in today&rsquo;s motion and the United Nations requirement  for autism awareness.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I think that this is the fourth Northern Ireland Assembly  debate on the issue since 2002, and I think that it is the second or third such  debate in which I have spoken. Yet none of the measures &mdash; universal ASD  screening, services for adults with autism and autism legislation &mdash; that was  supported unanimously in the Chamber has been put in place by the Departments  concerned.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That is in spite of an unusually active parent disability  lobby, which, as I said, we saw outside Parliament Buildings today. That lobby  should have enabled us to transcend the barrier of shame into action long ago.  The lobby is led by parents and people with autism. As I said, they brought the  issue up to the steps of Stormont today and into the Chamber.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I commend the genuine commitment of, and work undertaken  by, the Department of Education and the Department of Health, Social Services  and Public Safety with regard to long overdue policy and service initiatives  for autism. The Department of Education&rsquo;s task group on autism, supplemented by  a range of policy documents, has created initiatives, such as a regional ASD  psychology and advisory service and the Middletown Centre for Autism.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  &mdash; and I am pleased to see the Minister here, and I welcome him &mdash; has just  completed its consultation on an action plan for autism, the aim of which is to  address gaps in the early-years provision by establishing a care pathway and  removing the IQ barrier to service for individuals with Asperger&rsquo;s syndrome.  Significantly, autism has pioneered a major shift within the Department&rsquo;s  programme of care structures by establishing a new cross-cutting programme of  care. Yet, it still appears that we are light years away from the initiative  being appreciated and generalised across all Departments.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Our Departments appear to lag behind the voluntary sector,  which has pioneered ASD provision within a regional and partnership  perspective. It is therefore my view, and the view of the all-party group, that  it is imperative that the Assembly stands up for autism, seizes the initiative  and brings forward a legislative directive that creates a mechanism to ensure  several outcomes.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">First, it must ensure that autism is recognised and provided  for in a co-ordinated manner as a social and communication disability that  uniquely cuts across the remits of the Department of Health, Social Services  and Public Safety, the Department of Education, Department for Employment and  Learning (DEL), Department for Social Development (DSD), Department for  Regional Development (DRD) and the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure  (DCAL).</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, it must ensure that an autism advocate is  appointed for families and individuals with ASD to undertake specific  responsibilities, such as improving access to existing services to a review of  outdated disability legislation, addressing &ldquo;entitlement to services&rdquo; issues  for families and supporting families to access existing human rights and  equality provisions, which are currently reporting an under-representation of  cases with ASD.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Thirdly, it must ensure a regional autism strategy that  crosses key Departments, involves the voluntary sector and encompasses all  previous ASD policy initiatives while addressing the specific challenge of  support services for life transitions into adulthood and incorporating a  regional training strategy.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In proposing to introduce the autism Bill (NI) shortly, which  is a legislative response to the challenge of ASD, the all-party Assembly group  on autism has been informed by an independent report entitled &lsquo;Improving  Services for People with ASD&rsquo;, which was produced by the Assembly Research and  Library Service and published in 2008.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That report reviewed the existing legislation, policy and  practice in Northern Ireland.  It viewed the significance of the isolated departmental actions on autism as a  stepping stone towards legislation and not as an end in themselves in view of  the need to secure accurate and agreed data on the number of individuals with  autism to inform and map cross-departmental planning and funding; address the  gaps in existing legislation to counter discrimination &mdash; the report also  confirmed the barriers in access to services; and required Government to act  for autism to counteract the existing piecemeal accumulation of ASD policies  that focused on individual Departments.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Within the United Kingdom  and Ireland,  it is time for the Northern Ireland Assembly to decide whether or not it wants  to lead or follow. It is time for the Northern Ireland Assembly to stand up for  autism. The Welsh Government have agreed a cross-cutting regional response that  fits Wales.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In England,  the Autism Bill has had its successful Second Reading, and in Scotland, a  national cross-cutting strategy is being considered. Each jurisdiction must  devise a response that is unique to its situation. We can look to Wales for an example of a managed, accountable  ASD service infrastructure across all Departments; to Denmark for a national plan; to Sweden for  legislation on the entitlement to services from Government; and to other  jurisdictions as well. We can learn from the practice of other nations.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Members of the all-party Assembly group on autism ask for  the support of the Chamber once again, and for the support of the disability  community, in particular, as the Bill is progressed. The Bill will bring a  measure of recognition and equality to autism, which will raise the profile of  the whole disability sector generally. It is not about taking anything away  from anyone &mdash; it is about opening the door to a disability that has been denied  access because the strategies and learning techniques required have been alien  to our existing structures.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Children, young people and adults with autism, as well as  the families who live with them, have lobbied us hard over the past seven  years. Autism advocacy groups have been building a bridge for political action  so that change will happen, in our lifetime, for future generations. As the  last span of that bridge is put in place, let us make sure that we also put in  place the piece that is needed to meet their requirements.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>: I  want to deal with the issue of why legislation on autism is needed here.  Existing legislation does not mention ASD, and some people say that that leaves  a lot of flexibility, and that the legislation is not prescriptive: in other  words, by not ruling something in, you are not ruling anything else out.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">However, generic provision has never worked for ASD.  Generic services do not work for people with ASD &mdash; they need specialist ASD  intervention. They also need clarity and structure in the intervention required  for them. What works for everyone else does not work for ASD sufferers. ASD  sufferers currently get such provision from specific charities. It is solely  from those charities &mdash; who provide services and policies &mdash; that we have seen  progress on autism.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">People with ASD learn differently due to the nature of  their impairment. Unique teaching strategies and training are required for those  people. As a society, we need to put those in place. I have touched on the  generic nature of our existing legislation, but even within that, there are  sub-categories which are more detailed: for example, the Disability  Discrimination Act 1995 is weighted heavily towards physical disability &mdash; it  can be done.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Special needs services are required across the Department  of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, the Department for Social  Development and the Department for Employment and Learning. That those Departments  need to work together shows the need for legislation: how else can we bring  them together and make them work for the benefit of ASD sufferers?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Legislation is about giving parents official recognition,  after 18 years of lobbying against denial by services and Departments, that the  disability actually exists as a distinct and unique disability. It does not  have to co-exist with other learning disabilities. It is unique. Legislation  brings with it the imperative for action.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Legislation is essential in order to require public bodies  to, for instance, improve access to services and facilities for people with  ASD. Legislation is needed to establish foundations, principles and guidance  for a cross-cutting regional strategy for all Northern Ireland Departments. The  key obstacles to progress on ASD are lack of regional cross-departmental  strategy and funding.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Each Department prefers to produce its own action plan: in  2008, the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety brought out  its action plan; the Department of Education produced an action plan in 2009;  and there are three health and social care strategies. There is no joined-up  thinking about ASD sufferers.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">This legislation is needed because it requires all  Departments to work together strategically, rather than pay lip service to  policy collaboration. Legislation is critical because current legislative  recourse is having a negative impact on families, who are left in a catch-22  situation. If there is no official recognition of ASD against which to judge  cases, families usually end up giving up before going to court. Many cases  fail, and confusion is allowed to continue.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Legislation should recognise autism as a social and  communication disability, with a range of co-morbid conditions that necessitate  a unique degree of access across education, learning-disability, mental-health  and sensory-disability services. Legislation should require the appointment of  an ASD co-ordinator to act as an advocate for individuals with ASD and for  their families.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Member to bring his remarks to a close.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>: I  certainly will, Mr Deputy Speaker. That co-ordinator will monitor and develop a  cross-departmental strategy and make amendments to existing legislation. With  that in mind, I support the motion.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. &Eacute;ir&iacute;m le taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt don  r&uacute;n. I support the motion.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">At the outset, I commend the Minister of Education for the  report of the task group on autism and for the establishment and support in Middletown &mdash; in my  constituency &mdash; of the all-Ireland centre of excellence for the education of  children and young people with autism. In advance, I also commend the Minister  of Health, Social Services and Public Safety for the forthcoming autism action  plan.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Those are significant, positive milestones on the journey  to address a need that is not being met. The challenge for us all is that  autistic spectrum disorder does not fit neatly into one compartment. The  Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety is to be commended for  considering a new, cross-cutting programme of care to include ASD.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Other Departments such as DEL, DSD and DCAL must also buy in and  provide services to ASD sufferers and their families. An autism Bill is the  mechanism by which to combine all responsible Departments. The Bill would  establish a regional training strategy to be co-ordinated by the voluntary  sector, as happens in Scotland.  Specialist training of psychology, psychiatry and paediatrics staff is essential  &mdash; indeed, critical &mdash; in order to achieve an accurate service system.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The North of Ireland has the highest rate of staff training  in diagnostic interview for social and comm&shy;unication disorder, autism  diagnostic observation schedule and autism diagnostic interview &mdash; the main  specialist training assessment tools required for ASD diagnosis. That is  because Autism NI brought that training to the North in 1986, in partnership  with local paediatricians.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is also an autism diagnosticians forum, which,  although independent, began as an Autism NI special-interest group. The only  similar forum in existence is in Western    Australia. Unlike other disabilities, autism has been  subject to reliable diagnosis since only 2000. That is why the training of  health visitors in detecting ASD must be more strategic and less piecemeal than  current arrangements.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">3.00 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As far as we are aware, there have been only two health  visitors who specialise in detecting ASD employed in the North on temporary  contracts. Could those in the voluntary sector with relevant expertise be  utilised to supplement that provision with additional quality services?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is a major concern about the length of time it takes  for assessment and diagnosis. Current waiting times range from six months to  two years, which is due to a failure to prioritise and manage a co-ordinated  approach to ASD rather than a lack of funding. The first spend on ASD by the  Department of Health, Social Service and Public Safety was part of its  Priorities for Action 2003-04 and targeted that area. Further funding has since  been received.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department&rsquo;s action plan and Priorities for Action  2009-2010 imposed a target of 13 weeks on waiting lists, in line with other  health issues. However, it is difficult to adhere to that time frame when it  comes to ASD, and a concern exists that the opportunity to make an accurate  assessment may be lost to the pressures involved in trying to meet the  deadline.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">An autism Bill would encompass the Department&rsquo;s action plan  and Priorities for Action targets. Those would be supported by the long-term  regional ASD training strategy and a mechanism for a co-ordinated, consistent,  strategic service development for ASD. The Bill also addresses the issue of  adult diagnosis by establishing a cross-departmental requirement to plan  strategic service development with joint financing arrangements. That would  mean that joint diagnostic protocols, such as assessment and treatment, could  be applied to all individuals. Whether an individual was identified in education  or through the criminal justice system, the same protocols would be applied as  a right rather than a coincidence.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In the absence of at-home expertise, the Bill provides  access to the regional ASD advocate for an expert diagnosis of complex cases out  of state. That would facilitate an easy assessment of high cost, low-incidence  services for ASD to assist with service development.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member bring his remarks to a close?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>: I  will, sir.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill could result in the implementation of the guidelines  set by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network and the National  Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines on autism. Furthermore,  early intervention is the critical next step and must be integrated into any  proposed diagnostic service. I support the motion. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I thank my colleagues for helping to secure today&rsquo;s important debate. Many  Assembly debates are self-serving and party political, but this one addresses  an issue that cuts across our entire society, and we must work collectively to  make the necessary changes in service provision. Only cross-departmental working  and raising community awareness will improve the lives of the thousands of people  who suffer from autistic spectrum disorder in Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Autism is a particularly challenging learning disability  with social and behavioural implications that require support throughout an  individual&rsquo;s life. However, autism and autistic spectrum disorders do not  receive the necessary recognition, nor do those who suffer from it receive the  full range of support they require. The National Autistic Society Northern Ireland, in  conjunction with Autism NI, does great work in providing support and raising  awareness. The society suggests that more than 17,000 people in Northern Ireland  have autism. If their families are included in the figures, more than 68,000  people in this small Province are affected by autism.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">However, the society also estimates that more than 90% of  people do not know how common autism is. In addition, 55% of people who have  heard of autism think that it affects only children. Autistic spectrum disorder  has no physical attributes, which often leads to people suffering in silence.  Also, people can be misunderstood, misdiagnosed and shunned, which can lead to  further isolation. Today&rsquo;s debate is, therefore, crucial in raising community  awareness of the problems associated with autism.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I commend the United Nations for designating 2 April as  world autism awareness day, and I welcome the fact that that has initiated  today&rsquo;s debate.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is crucial that, throughout their lives, people get the  support that they need. That means that people who live with ASD &mdash; and their  families &mdash; need prompt assessment, diagnosis, treatment and support. That  support must be available as those children grow up and go through their  education and further learning into adulthood. Therefore, it is crucial that  Executive Departments provide integrated services, but that must take place  most explicitly between the Department of Health, the Department of Education,  the Department for Employment and Learning, the Department for Social  Development and the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>:  The Member referred to the fact that people see autism as a childhood disease.  Does he agree that it is particularly important that adults who are living with  autism have better access to diagnostic services so that they can take the  first steps in finding their way to get the proper support that they need in  order to be able to live their lives to the full?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I thank the Member for that useful intervention, and I agree wholeheartedly.  That is critical. There are many other issues to factor in, but access to  diagnostic services, as well as support throughout their lives, is critical.  That is why so many Depart&shy;ments need to be involved as those people progress  through their lives. We have made progress in recent years, but there is still  more work to be done.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I congratulate and thank the Minister of Health for launching  the autistic spectrum disorder strategic action plan, which hopefully, will be  implemented very shortly. The Minister&rsquo;s proposals are influenced heavily by  the excellent work of the independent review of autism services, which was  chaired by Lord Maginnis. The review is designed to standardise assessment,  diagnosis, treatment and support across all health trusts. The proposed  regional ASD group will co-ordinate services and promote the early  identification of developmental delay in children and early signs of autism.  That is a much-needed change, as some families and children are waiting for up  to three years to get a diagnosis, which means that they cannot get specialist  educational assistance and get on to a lifetime pathway of support.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There have been calls for new legislation on autism, but  the independent review highlighted categorically that it is not needed. We need  to focus on the implementation of existing strategies, not on further  unnecessary bureaucracy.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It would be remiss of me not to address a debate on autism  without raising the serious reservations that I have about the appropriateness  or potential effectiveness of the Department of Education&rsquo;s proposed Middletown centre of  excellence for autism.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That centre will be neither central nor excellent. It is my  firm belief that the project is a white elephant that will serve a few at the  expense of the majority of sufferers, and it may not even be appropriate for  those who are lucky enough to gain a place in it. There are serious  reservations about the medical provisions that are available to autistic  children in the area and about how the centre will provide excellence in  assessment, research, training and learning support in such an isolated  location. How will parents, let alone specialists who are stationed in  population centres, assess and be attracted to the proposed facility? There  appears to have been no forward planning in the choice of the site for the  centre of autism.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Member to please draw his remarks to a close.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  We have been left with a potential drain on much-needed resources.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  On behalf of the Alliance Party, the all-party Assembly group on autism, and  the United Community group, I support this important motion fully.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I was extremely proud and humbled to be part of the Stand  up for Autism rally outside Parliament Buildings earlier today and to be  standing shoulder to shoulder with people who are at the coalface and who know  exactly what is required. The Assembly must lead from the front, and all  Departments must give priority to providing the necessary support to everyone  with autism, both young and old.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is a sad fact that the number of people with autism is  increasing, and it is incumbent on all of us, particularly those who are in  Government, to act accordingly.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I pay tribute to organisations such as Autism Northern Ireland, the National Autistic Society Northern Ireland, and  other organisations and individuals at the forefront of providing support and  counsel to people with autism and their families. So much progress is being  made on a worldwide basis, and we are part of that progress. Some of us  recently visited the US,  a trip that culminated in the signing of a memorandum of understanding on  Capitol Hill. Of course, we are all working together locally in the Celtic  Nations Autism Partnership to make things better.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is now time for action to be taken across all  Departments in Northern    Ireland; there can be no more excuses.  People on the ground with experience of the needs of those with autism know  what is required.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As indicated by Dominic Bradley, the chairperson of the  all-party group, the Assembly must now support the autism Bill and put the  legal framework into operation as soon as possible. That Bill will ensure that  people with autism get the right access to services in areas such as health,  social care, education, employment and so on. Although I am glad that the Minister  of Health is here today, autism is not his sole responsibility; the other  Ministers in the Executive have a responsibility to get their teeth into this  and to get on with it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill should recommend that an autism co-ordinator be  appointed to ensure cross-departmental service development, and it should also  contain a strategy to link all Departments together. Furthermore, it should  provide trusts with suitably qualified and trained professional staff, and make  provision for support and information for those with autism. Critical to all of  that must be a ring-fencing of funding to deliver the ASD strategy.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In May 2008, the independent review of autism services,  chaired by Lord Maginnis, produced an extremely detailed report with a number  of crucial recommendations. Those recommendations must be adopted and worked on  to provide the best &mdash; and nothing but the best &mdash; services, now and in the  future, for those with autism.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I recently received some correspondence from the parents of  a youngster, pleading for proper planning for young adults with autism. Funding  should be made available for support, including learning and useful  stimulation, and the desire to care for youngsters in a family setting. Those  are fairly basic requests, and the Assembly must surely do what it can to  support that youngster and their family. Indeed, that request could be repeated  over and over again throughout Northern    Ireland. If the Assembly is to mean anything  at all, it must listen to the cries of ordinary people. We cannot let those  people down; let us bring ASD to the top of our agenda.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Thursday 2 April marks world autism day. That day has been  adopted by the United Nations General Assembly, and we are delighted to be part  of it. This Thursday will see autism organisations across the globe call on  their Governments for the help that is the entitlement of all people with  autism.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I plead with the Assembly, and more importantly with our  Executive, to stand up for autism as we have done today. Those with autism  need, deserve and must have the same opportunities as everyone else in our  society, from birth right through life&rsquo;s journey. Remember, children with  autism grow into adults with autism &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member please bring his remarks to a close?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  It is our duty to support those with autism all the way. I support the motion.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  Like all the other Members who have spoken in the debate today, I support the  motion. I put on record my appreciation to Arlene Cassidy from Autism NI and  the former Speaker of the Assembly, Eileen Bell, who has worked tirelessly  alongside staff to provide the secretariat services for the all-party Assembly  group on autism. I also want to mention the National Autistic Society, which  also carries out very sterling work. However, and more importantly, it would be  remiss of me not to mention the parents and family members of those who suffer  from ASD.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to deal with early or rapid intervention. Early  intervention gives meaning, moral justification and substance to the diagnostic  label of autism. Without it, diagnosis is a cold instrument of truth. Early  intervention has been led by the voluntary sector. Some commentators say that  there is an over-diagnosis of autism in Northern Ireland and that there is no  need to label individuals as autistic, because that prevents inclusion. Data on  autism is poor, and parents seek a diagnosis to give them direction and  support, which is not available in our society.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">One might ask from where those commentators get their evidence?  Worldwide research on early intervention across the disability community proves  its cost-effect&shy;iveness, and research in the field of ASD has confirmed that to  be the case here as well.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Early intervention in ASD is a specialist area, and it is  difficult to access in many parts of Northern Ireland. Therefore, a  diagnosis is often the gateway to that provision. Early-intervention strategies  for ASD are good models of practice for all people. An effective assessment and  diagnostic process will inform the content of early or rapid intervention,  which is based on individual need. Rapid intervention is rare, due to the lack  of adult diagnostic services and patchy treatment services.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The current process of diagnosis is too slow. A child might  not see a specialist for 18 months or two years &mdash; if they are lucky &mdash; after his  or her parent has brought him or her to the GP, during which time the child  could have been in an appropriate behaviour programme.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Some infants who are suspected of having autism reach  school age before they see a specialist. That cannot be allowed to continue.  Early and rapid intervention is essential to ensure that the child is placed in  a programme and receives the best level of care.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The role of the voluntary sector in providing a voice for  the needs of parents is vital. The Department of Health, Social Services and  Public Safety action plan has failed to give the voluntary sector a strategic  integrated role. Only an autism Bill (Northern Ireland) will be able to  provide that advocate for parents and strategic planning for an integrated role  for the voluntary sector.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The keyhole jigsaw of early intervention programme is  proven but not applied comprehensively across Northern Ireland. That programme  has been the subject of five research reports by the University of Ulster,  and it has achieved international recognition. It is a product of a unique  partnership of voluntary and statutory agencies alongside parents in Northern Ireland.  The keyhole jigsaw of early intervention programme includes a resource kit for  families, pre diagnosis; a training programme for preschool playgroups; a  training programme for parents; and a six-month home visit programme for the  child.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, the programme does not have recurrent funding  anywhere in Northern Ireland,  although various boards and trusts have purchased or implemented parts of it.  The programme design means that it must be a voluntary and statutory  partnership. The content of the keyhole jigsaw of early intervention programme  can be updated. Currently, it provides access to all ASD interventions and  strategies.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is a lack of co-ordinated action, and the problem  with the current system is that it works against main&shy;streaming innovative  practice. The Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety action  plan is limited to children&rsquo;s services for the next three years, and the  priorities for action for 2009 refer to the importance of early intervention  and set 13-week targets for access to specialist treatment, but do not specify  the existence of a pre-existing mechanism.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">An autism Bill would provide for an autism advocate for  parents and an integrated strategy that will facilitate quality programmes and  rapid intervention treatments for adults. The absence of a co-ordinated regional  response to early intervention has alienated families and encouraged them to  become supporters of various separate strategies. There needs to be a mechanism  for parents to access all appropriate interventions and intensive treatments  within the keyhole jigsaw of early intervention programme. I support the  motion.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  Unlike a number of the Members who have spoken in the debate, I am not a member  of the all-party Assembly group on autism. I commend the motion that is before  the House and welcome the fact that it is in the Order Paper. I wish to  concentrate on one aspect, although I commend 90% of the remarks that have been  made by Members who have spoken.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I take a degree of issue with what Mr McCallister said  about there being no need for legislation; I believe that there is such a need.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  will give way in a second or two.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I would also like to think that I would keep more of an  open mind than he has about the Middletown  centre for autism.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am happy to give way to Mr Bradley.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way. Is the Member aware that over the past  number of months, Mr McCallister has supported an autism Bill faithfully and  only last week offered to sign up his support for it? However, today he tells  us that he is opposed to it.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: Mr  McCallister will have to answer for himself on that point &mdash; one can only  speculate as to his motivation if he has performed a U-turn on the matter,  although we can probably use some guesswork in identifying that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As I indicated, a lot of good points have been made in this  debate. I want to concentrate on a matter that has been touched on by only a  couple of the Members who have spoken but that is one that I consider to be  equally valid. That is the problem of adults with autism. A good deal of  attention has &mdash; rightly &mdash; been paid to the importance of having early  intervention and enough protection for children with autism; however, in many  ways, the issue of adults with autism sometimes becomes the Cinderella issue of  the autism debate and can be ignored slightly.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In that respect, I commend the good work that the National  Autistic Society has done to highlight that issue. That organisation has  produced an excellent publication entitled &lsquo;I exist: The Message from Adults  with Autism&rsquo;. That document details the results of a survey that showed that,  of the adults with autism who took part in the survey, 96% feel that with more  support they would feel less isolated, 34% have experienced severe  mental-health difficulties, and 57% suffer from depression.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is a tendency to think of autism as purely a  childhood issue, particularly because of the impact that it has on our  education system. However, statistics show that one in 100 people suffer from  some form of autism, which is a condition that affects people throughout their  entire lives. As the National Autistic Society puts it, the challenge is to  think differently, act positively and transform lives.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Although the National Autistic Society is doing good work  with such things as its Help! programme, which provides degrees of support to  families and carers, the level of support that exists in Northern Ireland for  adults with autism is, at best, very patchy. Of the five trusts, one provides  more or less permanent family support workers, two other trusts have funding  for a family support worker who is provided simply on a one-year basis,  therefore calling into question whether that provision will be renewed, and two  others provide no support whatever.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As Mr Boylan indicated, in Northern Ireland there are now high  levels of training in the diagnosis of autism in the children&rsquo;s sector.  However, many adults with autism have gone undiagnosed for years, and it may be  that their symptoms are only properly described when they are bringing a member  of their family for diagnosis. We need to give the same level of support to adult  diagnosis. In relation to the literacy aspect, we need to ensure that there is  proper provision in the learning disability budget for the full range of autism  services and that a certain amount of money is autism specific.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As the National Autistic Society indicated, we must ensure  that, when it is implemented, the ASD strategic action plan meets the needs of  adults with autism. We need to ensure that the plan is fit for purpose and, to  help us to do that, the National Autistic Society has identified six objectives  that should be met.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">First, the local trusts must record the number of adults  with autism in their areas. I believe that, until now, there has been a  weakness in that area. Secondly, there should be a named professional in each  trust area who is responsible for diagnosing adults with autism. Thirdly,  health and social care trusts should establish a clear route to enable adults  with Asperger syndrome or high-functioning autism to access assessment and  support. Fourthly, health professionals who are in regular contact with adults  with autism must be trained properly. Fifthly, adults with autism and their  families and carers should be involved in the development of services &mdash; we  cannot simply have something imposed on people; we need to work with them.  Finally, the new autism-spectrum services should be developed for adults, their  families and their carers.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We need to give that support across the spectrum. Much good  work has been done, but there is a good lot to be done. Obviously, it is an  interdepartmental issue. However, in tackling the great problem of the provision  for autism, we must ensure that, in providing the best of services, adults with  autism are not simply ignored. I urge Members to support the motion.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>: I  declare an interest as secretary of the all-party Assembly group on autism, and  I support the motion. However, I wish to speak about a number of matters that  worry me greatly about how we deal with autism in Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister of Education has gone out of her way to push  for an autism facility at Middletown,  which has the potential, dare I say it, to become a major North/South white  elephant. Already, the Minister has spent more than &pound;3&middot;4 million of taxpayers&rsquo;  money on that facility, and yet not one child has benefited. Members have  raised concerns about the facility with the Minister on numerous occasions. However,  she has continually dismissed any points that have been raised.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am concerned that a huge amount of resources will be  wasted in bringing children out of their local, stable environment for a  five-week period, unsettling them &#8213; which, as any parent of an autistic child  would tell you, is not a good idea &#8213; and then, when the five weeks are over,  pushing them back to their home environment.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We need a proper autism strategy in Northern Ireland  &mdash; not legislation. Parents want to see delivery on the ground, and that is  where the help is needed. We need local services, delivered locally, with early  identification, early assessment and diagnosis and, most importantly, early  intervention.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Shortly after assuming office, my colleague, the Minister  of Health, Social Services and Public Safely, recognised that autism was a  major issue. He was determined to take action and initiated the independent  review of autism services, so that a clear strategy could be developed for  future services. The independent review &mdash; chaired by Lord Maginnis, as my  colleague has just said &mdash; made a number of clear recommend&shy;ations, and it also  had its own concerns about the facility at Middletown. The fact that an international  panel of autism experts has misgivings about the centre, clearly leads one to  conclude that that facility has not been considered properly.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The purchase of the Middletown  site cost millions, refurbishing it will cost more millions, and yet, in the  whole process, not one autism expert has been even consulted. At departmental  level in the Department of Education, not one autism expert is employed to head  up that and other projects affecting autistic children, and, in this day and  age, that is just not on.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We need to invest our money in local services &mdash; not  buildings detached from population centres. We must provide the parents of  autistic children with the help and support that they need, properly funded,  rather than trying to make a name for any particular organisation by trying to  create an autism Bill that would not be worth the paper on which it was  written.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Will the Member confirm whether he has signed a pledge of support for an autism  Bill for Northern Ireland?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>:  We certainly support the bid for a new autism centre; however, we have  information on the report on autism services in Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to make a few comments regarding Autism NI. I  readily acknowledge the wide range of work that that organisation undertakes  and has been providing throughout the Health Service here for many years.  However, I have a number of concerns about recent activities. I have received  complaints from parents of autistic children who are dissatisfied with the  direction that Autism NI has taken regarding legislation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The reality is that, despite devoting much time, energy and  money to that cause, a proposed autism Bill will not provide any assistance to  parents where they need it most.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is most disturbing that Autism Northern Ireland has  spent thousands of pounds courting Members of Parliament and Members of this  House, yet parents across the country are crying out for help. I appeal to  Autism Northern Ireland  to work with all shareholders to address the current need. As Lord Maginnis&rsquo;s &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order, please. I am finding it difficult to hear the Member. Other  Members should give the Member their attention.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>: I  will draw my remarks to a close. All that my party and I want is to ensure that  the parents of autistic children in Northern Ireland receive all the  help that they need.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  I welcome and support today&rsquo;s motion. It is clear that the all-party Assembly  group on autism is standing up for autism by bringing forward the draft autism  Bill on behalf of the parents, the carers and the health organisations that it  represents. I was very disappointed that the Member who spoke previously said  that thousands of pounds have been spent by an organisation in order to court  Assembly Members. At some stage, that statement should be withdrawn, because it  is unfair and incorrect. It impugns the character of so many people who work  and care for people with autism.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  Does the Member agree that the Member who spoke previously made those comments  to deflect from the fact that his party does not stand up for people with  autism?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  That is the case. That party will have to defend its position, because it  signed up for the proposals one day and withdrew its support the next.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The awareness of autism is increasing due to well-organised  campaigns that are mounted by Autism Northern Ireland, which is a local charity  that consists of parents, professionals, support groups, friends, acquaintances  and constituents. Thankfully, people are becoming more aware of what autistic  spectrum disorders are. That is to be appreciated, given that those disorders  affect 20,000 people across Northern    Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, there is still a lack of understanding of  autism, as it is a hidden and very diverse condition. However, there is scope  for that understanding to improve. That is one of the reasons why Members feel  that it is appropriate to bring forward an autism Bill for Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion draws attention to the challenges of the health,  educational and social care needs of people with autistic spectrum disorder. I  will briefly address some of those needs in turn. In recent years, parents have  become increasingly concerned about the inadequacy of services in Northern Ireland  for individuals with autism and, in particular, Asperger&rsquo;s syndrome. It is  generally thought that parents of autistic children are more likely to see  their child&rsquo;s special health needs going unmet.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Many autistic children have additional physical and  mental-health needs. Parents who care for autistic children face a  significantly greater burden as they try to deal with their emotional,  developmental and behavioural problems. Many parents in that position have to  cut back on the hours that they work, and single parents may have to quit their  jobs altogether to look after their autistic children.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We currently face a range of problems with autism, such as  the waiting lists for diagnosis of autism; the diagnostic process itself;  intervention after diagnosis; day services; and respite &mdash; the list is by no  means exhaustive. Although recommendations have been made about those issues,  we need to see more action and improvements. The Health Service must enhance  diagnostic assessment and early intervention services for children and young  people. It is essential that medical professionals work in partnership to  address the needs of individuals who suffer from autism.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As a number of Members have stated, older individuals with  autism are falling through the system&rsquo;s cracks. That has huge implications for  their development, life and social skills, and their mental health. That issue  has been raised by mental-health organisations, parents and carers.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Autism and education is a hot topic for schools and parents  in Northern Ireland  and around the world as the occurrence of autism in children increases, unfortunately,  very rapidly. Today, teachers have a much higher number of autistic children in  their classrooms than was the case a decade ago. For that reason, it is very  important that all children receive appropriate education and structured  support. That support must be made available to help to maximise skills and to  enable every child to achieve their full potential, not only in childhood, but  in adulthood.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In May 2008, the independent review of autism services  recommended that autism-awareness training should be part of teacher-training  courses, and that is an important point. It is crucial that a teacher can  address the ongoing and changing needs of the child growing up in the education  system.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Autistic spectrum disorders are lifelong developmental  disabilities. There is a mistaken belief that autism affects only children.  Worryingly, people do not realise that difficulties continue into, and right  through, adulthood. As a society, we should try our best to learn and  understand what adult autism is all about, what it is like and the unfortunate  circumstances that lead up to it. We must also find the best way to help and  give comfort and support to adults with autism.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The National Autistic Society reported that 63% of adults  with ASD say that they do not get enough support to meet their needs. That is  another challenge for the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety, and I am delighted that he is present for today&rsquo;s debate. Many parents  and carers do not get enough support from statutory agencies, and some have yet  to receive a carers&rsquo; assessment. There is little guidance for professionals who  carry out assessments, and, because of communication difficulties, it is not  always easy to identify the needs of an adult with ASD.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion is timely and the SDLP supports it, and, more  importantly, the autism Bill that I hope will be brought before this Chamber on  behalf of parents in Northern    Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  At the outset, I apologise for not being present at the start of the debate,  but I was chairing the Committee on Procedures.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this timely motion,  which raises an important issue. It is imperative that the nature and  expression of this disorder are further highlighted and, consequently,  understood by society to ensure that sufferers are neither penalised nor  marginalised during their lives as a result of collective ignorance about their  condition and symptoms.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Autism and Asperger&rsquo;s syndrome are wide-ranging conditions  with varying degrees of seriousness. Autism is known as a lifelong  developmental disability, and sufferers share three main areas of difficulty  that affect them in different ways. Those three social categories are  communication, interaction and imagination &mdash; routine experiences that we take  for granted day in and day out. However, for autism sufferers, those matters  are not straightforward and can impact severely on their daily life and the  daily lives of their families and carers. Thus, a specialist programme must be  put in place to help sufferers to deal with daily living, while sensitively  handling their specific needs.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The matter does not apply only to selective education, because  when the school bell rings, the autistic child&rsquo;s difficulties do not  immediately stop. As with most conditions, their needs are constant and  continuous, but care and support levels have fallen far short of those provided  for other learning disabilities.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Similarly, what of the teenage and adult sufferers of ASD?  What sort of support is in place for their specific needs? The independent  review of autism services recognised the lack of ASD services across Northern Ireland,  particularly for older adolescents and adults. Consequently, the review team&rsquo;s  main focus was to develop specialist ASD services, while emphasising the need to  create more co-ordination and cohesion across the broad range of services that  are required.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The team found that the main delay in progress and the lack  of specific services came down to financial constraints. It is therefore  essential that a pragmatic approach is adopted to ensure that the needs of ASD  sufferers are seen as a priority, given that they have been somewhat  short-changed in the past, possibly through a lack of pertinent knowledge.  Thankfully, we are at last witnessing a change in that regard, and ASD is becoming  a more widely known and understood condition. However, I must admit that I was  shocked by the figures for Northern    Ireland, and I had not fully comprehended  the extent of the issue.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Alongside educational service and care support, however,  there needs to be a faster and more streamlined diagnosis for those who may be  affected. In some areas, a child has had to wait for up to 26 months to be  assessed. That is a long time for a parent coping with a young child with  learning difficulties, and, surely, in our modern society, that is totally  unacceptable and needs to be changed. I hope that the Minister will take a  long, hard look at that situation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In a statement last June, the Health Minister acknowledged  the need to address the shortfall in ASD services in areas such as workforce,  specialist assessment, early intervention, structured behavioural interventions  and family support. I welcome the fact that the Minister is fully aware of the  situation, and would hope that he plans to fast-track proposals for the  implementation of the review team&rsquo;s recommendations.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will conclude by paying tribute to parents, charities, carers,  support groups and others who have championed this cause, and led to a serious  rethink in relation to ASD and, indeed, at times &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Will the Member join me in expressing his disappointment at the remarks made by  Mr Savage in the Chamber earlier? Will he also join me in dissociating himself  from those remarks, and in describing them as disgraceful and demanding that Mr  Savage withdraws those remarks?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  I have to say that I did not hear the remarks of Mr Savage, because Mr Savage  was on his feet speaking when I came into the House. So, I cannot truthfully  comment on what Mr Savage did or did not say. I understand that he did cause  constern&shy;ation among some Members around the House in whatever he said, but I  must emphasise that I did not hear his comments.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, I warmly congratulate all those who have, at  times, ploughed a very lonely furrow when the condition of ASD was neglected  and not appreciated or understood by many people. It is because of the  campaigning and championing of the issue by many people that we are debating it  in the House today. I trust that the Minister, and the rest of us, will be more  appreciative and understanding of the subject.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  Like others, I support the motion. Some important and positive points have been  made in the debate. One of those has been the repeated emphasis of the need to  recognise the number of adults with autism. In the past, a lot of our debates  have, naturally and understandably, focused on children with autism, the need  for diagnosis and services and the pressures faced by their families. However,  the increasing recognition of the needs and circumstances of adults with autism  is a very positive development and is, in many ways, a credit to a lot of the  organisations that have campaigned on the issue, including very strong campaigns  such as the &ldquo;I Exist&rdquo; campaign, which I helped to launch here and in different  aspects of which others, too, have been involved.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is increasing awareness of autism at a certain  public-policy level. The general public, too, maybe has an increased awareness  of autism partly as a result of the campaigns that I have mentioned and partly  through some media depictions of people at various points of autistic spectrum  disorder. However, that in many ways leads to an assumption that there has been  a comparable increase in the provision and development of services, resources  and policy commitments to meet that wider public understanding. Many people  assume that, because more people are being diagnosed, and because the statistics  are becoming stronger, that, somehow, services are being topped up  commensurately, and, clearly, that is not the case.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is the case all too often that parents of children who  have been diagnosed as autistic have to navigate their way through systems and  negotiate between services as though they are the first to be in that situation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is an indictment of us all, and of the logic of the  public-policy system, that that is still the case. There is better  understanding and awareness, yet when the stage of diagnosis is reached &mdash; and we  have heard much about the long wait to get to that &mdash; they find themselves still  in a limbo.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Parents have to do more and more research into the  condition to find out different aspects for themselves. They have to surf  between the various organisations and charities to gain more awareness and find  out more information and greater detail about potential services. They find  themselves pushed about from one service provider to another, and they hear  phrases such as, &ldquo;not quite fitting our budget&rdquo;, &ldquo;we do not have a proposal  yet&rdquo; and &ldquo;that is a good idea and we will work on something there&rdquo;.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That is why the all-party Assembly group on autism is such  a useful instrument. It helps to bring together the different experiences and  frustrations that Members encounter in their constituencies, and it provides a  platform for the ideas of the various organisations which deal with those  issues.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Health Minister&rsquo;s presence at the debate and  the commitments that he has made. We have a strategic action plan, and it is  very welcome, even if some Members want it to contain more or believe that the  plan does not go far enough. We might raise questions about the other  Departments and ask whether they will play their part.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I also recognise the work of the independent review of  autism services, chaired by Lord Maginnis. He has issues about the Middletown  Centre for Autism, which he raised yesterday at the meeting of the  British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly. There is an argument that that centre is  a prestige project that does not deal with everything. However, let us be  clear: it is a positive and important commitment, and it plays a positive role.  Just as one size does not fit all, one centre does not fit all. That centre is  not an adequate response, and we need a much more articulate and guaranteed  provision of services at all levels and in all localities.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That brings me to the point of a Bill. I am perturbed to  hear Members pour cold water on the idea of a Bill. We have had positive  commitments in the past: when the taskforce reported a number of years ago,  very strong commitments were made by the Department of Health, Social Services  and Public Safety and the Department of Education and yet we have not seen them  fully put into practice. Only a Bill will give us that sort of guarantee. That  is why I supported the private Member&rsquo;s Autism Bill for England and Wales  in Westminster  a few weeks ago: it creates an important precedent. If MPs vote that Bill  through Westminster,  there will be no argument against a similar Bill in this Assembly.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Why Members of this Assembly should argue against  legislating on the issue I am at a loss to understand.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  will speak first as the Chairperson of the Committee for Education. The issue  has been brought to our attention, and it is relevant to the Education  Department.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will set in context what the Committee has heard over the  past two years. It has received various briefings from Autism NI, for example;  a joint briefing with the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public  Safety; a meeting with the parents of children with ASD from Lisburn; and a  meeting with Hugh Morgan, the implementation manger of the autistic spectrum  disorder strategic action plan for Wales. The Committee&rsquo;s Deputy Chairperson  represented the Committee on an Autism NI-organised Celtic Nations Autism Partnership  visit to the US, where it  met representatives of similar organisations in Washington in September 2007. The Committee  is also scheduled to meet with Wendy Lawson, an advocate for people with autism,  with Autism NI on 28 April.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In October last year, the Committee heard from the chief  executive of the Middletown Centre for Autism and some of his senior  colleagues. The Committee raised a number of concerns at that time and received  detailed responses from the centre and the Department of Education. I will  return to those when, in a few moments, I speak as a Member. One key issue  raised was the need for an overall strategy for autism in Northern Ireland.  Previously, the Committee had heard from Hugh Morgan, on his role to oversee  the implementation of the all-Wales autism strategy.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for Education received a compre&shy;hensive  update, a briefing paper from the Department of Education, in September 2008,  which included statistics on the prevalence of ASD and the educational  provision &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr W McCrea</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way. Does he accept that although we have heard  the statistics, which are very important, we need to always be very careful to  remember that those statistics represent people? Behind every one of those  people is a family that is, in many ways, at a loss to know what to do. Therefore,  as legislators, we must ensure that everything is done to help those families  through their time of crisis, and continuing crisis, in their family&rsquo;s  development.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  concur with the Member&rsquo;s comments. We always need to keep that focus when  debating these issues and we cannot allow statistics to get in the way of  reality. Children, young people and their families have huge issues to face as  a result of dealing with ASD.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The issue of specific legislation was raised. I am happy to  make available to Members the report that the Department of Education prepared  for the Education Committee. It is worthwhile reading that report: it certainly  gave the Committee a very informed perspective on legislation and other issues  around ASD. One issue arising from that paper, and from other recent and very  welcome initiatives that address the early diagnosis and assessment of children  &mdash; including funding from the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety &mdash; is the need for a Northern Ireland strategy for autism. Time and again  we keep coming back to that, and it is something that needs to be underscored  by the debate.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There needs to be a cross-departmental strategy involving  the Department of Education, the Department of Health, the Department for  Employment and Learning, and others, together with voluntary sector interests  and the Middletown Centre for Autism. The template for that has been developed  in Wales.  It raises the question of whether we need a champion for autism. After today&rsquo;s  debate, I certainly do not think that that champion will be Mr Savage. One  Department must take the lead on that work, and I note that the Health Minister  is due to respond to the debate.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Very briefly, I will talk about issues that the parent of  two boys with Asperger&rsquo;s syndrome raised with me today. Knowing that this  debate was coming up, she sent me a text message summarising the issues she  deals with as the parent of two boys with Asperger&rsquo;s syndrome. Networking of  services, early grief counselling for parents of newly diagnosed children, and  continued support services for teenagers who have ASD are all issues. The other  issue was around education and support for carers. We need to remember the  carers of, and the people involved in caring for, people with ASD.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, there needs to be more training in  recognising ASD, and it should be part of the profess&shy;ional training of all  front line health and education professionals. All staff working with children  and adults should be alert to the telltale signs of ASD. A clear referral route  should be established, with key workers appointed to provide support to  individuals and their families. I support the motion.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  As a member of the all-party group on autism, I support the motion. As the  Members who spoke previously have pointed out, there have been a number of  important and positive milestones on the journey towards meeting the needs of  people with autism. I particularly welcome the fact that the Department of  Health is considering a new cross-cutting programme of care that will include  ASD. However, there is a long way to go to provide satisfactory services. What  about the services provided by other Departments: DCAL, DEL,  DSD and so on? We need a mechanism to join together all Departments and  services for people with ASD and their families. That mechanism is the proposed  autism Bill.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly research paper, &lsquo;Improving Services for People  with ASD&rsquo;, must be given serious consid&shy;eration, along with the response from  the all-party group on autism.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Autism is a lifelong condition, and anyone with it needs  support throughout his or her life. The needs of individuals with autism are  wide-ranging. Autism is a neurological disability that requires specialist prog&shy;rammes  that are supported by specific assessment tools, such as the diagnostic  interview for social and communication disorders, the autism diagnostic  observation schedule and the autistic diagnostic interview &ndash; revised.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Those types of intervention range across health and education  and include behavioural treatments, education-based approaches and visual  communication systems. The Bamford Review, in its limited consideration of the  provision of services to individuals with ASD, pointed out the importance of  good systems of training.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The &ldquo;I Exist&rdquo; campaign highlighted the gap between the  support that adults with ASD need and what they actually receive. The fact that  there is no accurate figure for the number of people suffering from ASD is a  major problem for service provision. The lack of co-ordination across services  and Departments is a significant factor in limiting service development and  funding priorities. However, a review of the research evidence suggests that  there is a lack of available services for people with ASD. Services are  inadequate, and they can also take years to obtain, when early intervention is  so important.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There are three main options for improving on ASD services.  First, the Government can continue to use the existing policy mechanisms to  provide services for individuals with ASD but apply extra funding. The Department&rsquo;s  action plan takes that route, and that is not adequate. Secondly, the  Government can strategically examine what they want to achieve in providing ASD  services and can develop a civic, cross-cutting strategy to improve on the  co-ordination of the services and eliminate gaps.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The all-party group proposes that a third option be taken.  The Government can create a legal obligation for action on ASD by enshrining it  in legislation. That approach is taken by the Autism Bill, and we believe that  that is the way forward. There is no legislation in the United Kingdom or Ireland that is specific to ASD.  ASD-specific legislation is needed, and the all-party group proposes a number  of options.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Will the Member agree that the position of the Ulster Unionist Party on an  autism Bill is, to put it mildly, all over the place? A Member from that party  who spoke supported the Bill last week but does not support it this week. A  Member from that party signed the petition of support to the Bill last week but  withdrew his name this week. At Westminster,  the private Member&rsquo;s Bill is supported by the Ulster Unionists&rsquo; sister party,  the Tories. Indeed, that Bill is being advanced by a Tory.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  I agree; I am not particularly clear on where the Ulster Unionists stand on the  issue. Legislation is essential.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">First, legislation that relates to information gathering, similar  to that which exists in the United    States, is inadequate. That type of  legislation ensures that research is being funded and carried out to map ASD  with a specific aim to inform service planning. Secondly, legislation can be  sought to counter discrimination against people with ASD, including filling the  gaps where existing legislation is believed not to be adequate. The third  option is to create legislation that requires Government to provide autism  services or which establishes a specific autism strategy. That is addressed by  the Autism Bill.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, I appeal to the disability community to support  the legislation, and I support the motion.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: I thank the  proposers of the motion. The debate has been interesting, although Members have  talked a lot about legislation and not enough about what needs to be done.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Given the importance and priority that all of us attach to  autistic spectrum disorder (ASD), the debate provides a welcome opportunity to  outline the way forward. Prevalence rates have been discussed and argued over  by experts for many years. There is no universally accepted figure. However,  the medical-research figure of approximately 90 cases per 10,000 people provides  a useful starting point.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It would be a mistake to suggest that any one exercise or  action will lead to the identification of all ASD cases in Northern Ireland.  One of my first actions as Health Minister was to set up an independent review  of autism services, which was chaired by Lord Maginnis. That did not need  legislation forcing me to do it: I did it because I knew that it needed to be  done.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Following on from that review, my Department is preparing  an ASD action plan, which will be published shortly. The plan will promote  earlier identification and diagnosis. It will also ensure better co-ordination  and collaboration with other agencies and Departments to provide services that  are linked to people who are affected by ASD at all stages of their lives. Some  Members made those points. Perhaps not all Members have had time to read the  action plan.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It will take time, plus the co-operation of different  Departments and agencies together with the expertise that is available in the  voluntary and community sector, to compile an overall picture of all of those  who are affected. Even when that is done, there will still be cases where  people have not had contact with providers or a need for services, including  health and social care, further education, social security or specific housing  needs.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The absence of a quick fix or any easy answer should not  deflect us from the task of compiling data to piece together more accurate  figures for the numbers that are involved. That information will help to inform  the development of a range of services across a range of Departments. Research  on ASD is under way across the world, and new ideas and information will inform  the development of services. As we gain more under&shy;standing, we can develop and  refine our services, and also promote awareness and more targeted training to  help us to understand ASD and to help individual families and carers.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We need to promote an understanding that individuals can be  affected by autism in different ways and to different extents. As a result,  some people need different types and levels of help. The most effective  response that we can offer is a wide range of services that can address the  needs of individual cases. Many of us have an understanding of the challenges  that are faced by individuals, their families and carers, including  difficulties with language and communication; with social and emotional  interaction; and with flexibility of thought and imagination. That can be  associated with a range of learning disabilities and other conditions, which can  make diagnosis extremely difficult.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Many individuals who are affected by ASD may have no  learning disabilities. Some people with ASD will have average or above-average  intelligence. Some people can seem to function in everyday life, but may  struggle with social interaction or with transitions through different stages  of their lives. Some might live their lives in a state of constant distress. If  we are to cover all of the need for all cases, we must ensure that the  policies, services and approaches that we develop fit together. That needs to  cover issues that include health and social care, social security, education,  further education, housing, employment and leisure facilities.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There have been some calls for autism-specific legislation.  My response was to put that question to an independent review of autism  services. The review team concluded that it did not regard autism-specific  legislation as necessary or appropriate at this stage. Indeed, I have listened  to the debate and I am still waiting to hear what exactly is missing from Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  legislation that I need to put in place in order to allow me to address those  needs. We already have full-scale equality and disability legislation &mdash; more  than any other part of the UK.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That does not suggest that autism is less of a priority, or  less of a challenge for families or individuals, or that the gap between the  services that we have and those that we need is reduced in any way. If anyone  doubts the urgency and importance that are attached to autism services, they  can look at the actions that I have taken.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I announced an independent review and, 12 months later,  published a draft strategic action plan for public consultation. I am sure that  Members will agree that actions speak louder than legislation. After the  consult&shy;ation, I anticipate that the full action plan will be published in May.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I thank the Minister for giving way. The longer I listen to the Minister&rsquo;s  response to the debate, the angrier I become. If the Minister had been outside the  Building today, he would have seen at first hand the number of people that are  crying out for help. I can speak with some authority, because although it is  not in the same bracket as autism, I know exactly what people with young people  need at the moment. The Minister is rambling, and he does not seem close to  outlining the help that those people will receive. They do not need help next  year or the year after &mdash; they need it now. On behalf of the people who have  come here today, I plead with the Minister &mdash; and other Ministers &mdash; to get their  head around this issue and to provide the services now that those people need.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: That was a ramble if ever there  was one. Mr McCarthy has, clearly, not listened to a word that I have said. I  am taking action, and that is why I have produced the strategy and the action  plan. The proposed full action plan will be ready for publication in May 2010.  I cannot be any clearer.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I intend to improve autism services without preventing  people from accessing other services or promoting competition between different  groups that lobby for resources. Part of the problem is that nobody has  identified a specific legislative gap that needs filled. The range of powers  available to me is already broad and comprehensive. If we are unable to deliver  a service or an action at some point in the future because of legal barriers,  we can revisit the issue then. For the time being, that seems unlikely.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: No; I will carry on for a  minute, and then let the Member in.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Meeting the respite needs of individuals who are affected  by learning disabilities &mdash; including autism &mdash; is a high priority for everyone.  Plans are in place to gain more detailed information on respite services across  all the health and social care trusts. That will provide a clearer picture of  the overall provision and inform the process of developing respite services in  the future.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>: I  thank the Minister for giving way. We must be careful about contraposing the  strategy and action plan that the Minister has mentioned with the need for  legislation. Those of us who argue for the introduction of legislation do not  support it at the expense of a strategy or action plan. However, those who  argue against legislation seem to support a strategy without legislation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Has the Minister read the private Member&rsquo;s Bill at Westminster? Essentially,  it covers the six key points that Lord Morrow outlined that are not covered by  existing Northern Ireland  legislation. Nobody is obliged to obtain information about the number of  children and adults with ASD. One service is not obliged to inform another  service, and legislation would create such provision. The Minister might be  concerned that legislation would be health-specific and centred solely in one  Department. However, nobody in the House wants a Bill that centres solely on  his Department; it should take in other Departments as well.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The Member mentioned action  versus legislation. I have heard a lot of talk about legislation; I am saying  that I have the legislation that I require right now. Members should let me  know if they identify a gap &mdash; I will fill that gap. However, right now, I am  talking about addressing the matter. When I became a Minister two years ago,  that was one of my first actions. Although the Department is finally about to  publish its action plan, people such as Kieran McCarthy are calling for  legislation, and nothing but legislation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">World autism awareness day is on Thursday. It will help to  raise awareness about autistic spectrum disorders. We need all the autism  awareness days that we can get; we need to raise autism awareness every day.  That is why the ASD action plan places an emphasis on providing awareness  training and, where appropriate, more specialist training. Part of the  consultation exercise on the ASD strategic action plan asks for ideas on  engaging with others and working in partnership in order to promote ASD  services.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We have a wealth of ideas and opinions on how to engage  with others. The historic underfunding of services for those affected by autism  has meant that many people have experienced difficulties. That needs to end.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Autism services need to improve to ensure an improved  quality of life for individuals and their families. It is an indicator of the  importance attached to autism services by all those involved, myself included,  that over &pound;2 million in investment has been secured for autism services.  Alongside with that new funding, trusts have been set a new target under the  priorities for action for 2009-2010 whereby, by March 2010, no child will wait  longer than 13 weeks for assessment following referral, and a further 13 weeks  for commencement of specialised treatment. Lord Morrow said that the Minister  should take note; it should be clear from the priorities for action &mdash; which  were published some time ago &mdash; that I did take note.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Money will never be the only way to improve services, and  services do not have to be resource intensive. We need to identify and share  examples of best practice, and take note of what individuals, families and  carers have to say about services. Examples of best practice are evident in the  voluntary and community sector, where people know how to innovate and develop  services using the available resources. That sector also provides an essential  resource for families and statutory services. We can always rely on those in  the voluntary and community sector to tell it as they see it, rather then  telling us what we want to hear.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We need to hear all of the various opinions and take  account of the full range of voices in the voluntary and community sector. The  need to develop more services to meet the needs of adults who are affected by  autism is clear and accepted by all concerned. The need to develop services for  people of all ages is outlined in the ASD strategic action plan &mdash; it is not  simply about children. The ASD regional group, to be established as part of the  action plan, will take forward a range of actions intended to raise both the  range and level of services for adults &mdash; and people of all ages &mdash; who are  affected by autism.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The regional group will be led by the Health Department and  the five trusts, and will comprise representatives of DSD, the Department of  Education, DCAL, and the voluntary and community sector. We are preparing our  action plan for publication; other Departments can then see what we propose to  do, and how we will need to get it done. The plans that those Departments make  to develop and improve their services will be discussed through the regional  ASD group, and can work alongside the plans of my Department.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Only by close co-operation and collaboration can we help to  close all of the gaps and provide the full range of services that are needed.  This is not a matter for the Department of Health alone. I am gratified to  discover that all other parties support the initiative, support sufferers of  ASD, and recognise the need to go forward. As those parties control the other  Departments, I am sure that I will have absolutely no problem in getting that  co-operation.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I have just finished, so the  Member will have to shout at me another day.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Before continuing with the  winding-up speech, I shall say a few words on behalf of the Committee for  Health, Social Services and Public Safety, of which I am the Deputy  Chairperson. The Health Committee has taken a key interest in the issue of  autism, and has been supportive of efforts to improve services for people with  autism.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We pressed the Minister to address the issue, and welcomed  the setting up of the independent review of autism services in September 2007.  Lord Maginnis, who chaired that review, briefed the Committee when his report  was published in July 2008. A draft action plan, to which the Minister has  referred, was subsequently published and put out for consultation. The  Committee listened to a range of views, and paid a visit to Wales, before  making a response to that action plan.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The main issued that was highlighted by the Committee, and  about which we have heard several times throughout the debate, was that the  draft action plan seeks to address services for people with ASD solely from a  health perspective. We need a much more holistic approach. In his evidence to  the Committee, Lord Maginnis acknowledged that shortcoming when he told us that  the one constraint on our inquiry was that we did not have the authority to  step outside the parameters dictated by the Department of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Lord Maginnis also felt that other Departments had no  desire to co-operate, and unless that is overcome difficulties will emerge in  future.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Does the Member agree with me that the present piecemeal provision leads only  to the type of wrangling that we have heard today over the Middletown centre? Does she also agree that  we need the services of the Department of Education, DEL, DCAL and DSD as well as the Department  of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, and that the most effective  vehicle for the delivery of that cross-cutting support is autism legislation?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  I thank the Member for his intervention, and I agree fully with him.  Representatives of Autism NI and the National Autistic Society stressed to the  Committee that the needs of people with autism can be met only by  cross-departmental action with a legislative imperative.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  I am running out of time. If I have time at the end, I will give way.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">When we visited the Welsh Assembly Government we learned  that three years ago they adopted a social-care model of services for people of  all ages with autism involving not just their Department for Health and Social  Services but their Department for Children, Education, Lifelong Learning and  Skills and other Departments. A strategic autism action plan for Wales was  published in April 2008 and signed off by the Ministers for those  aforementioned Departments. They stressed that working in partnership,  especially with the voluntary sector, was the key to success in that area. We  also witnessed partnerships in action when we visited a number of projects in Wales. There is  much that we can learn from how autism is dealt with there.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the opportunity to bring the Assembly&rsquo;s attention  to the Committee&rsquo;s main recommendation to the Minister of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety. The Committee put forward the view that although  autism is primarily a health issue, other Departments, including the Department  of Education, the Department for Employment and Learning, the Department for  Social Development and the justice system have a crucial role to play. The  development of the autism action plan offers an opportunity to broaden the  approach to developing comprehensive services for people of all ages with  autism. The Committee strongly recommends that the Minister of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety should take this issue to the Executive and seek the  establishment of a ministerial subgroup to develop a joined-up approach to the  issue. We await the publication of the Minister&rsquo;s response.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Speaking as an MLA and as a member of the Assembly  all-party group on autism, I thank everyone who contributed to the debate. The  majority of parties in the House have sent a clear message to those who live  with autism every day &mdash; and to the parents, carers and friends who took the  time to come to the steps of Stormont this morning &mdash; that we will support them  in their cause and for the protection of their rights.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A number of key issues were highlighted during the debate,  one of which is that autism does not fit in existing legislation. I want to  tell the House what autism is not: it is not a learning, physical or sensory  disability; it is not a mental-health issue, a medical condition or a disease.  It is a social and communication disability. It can exist alongside any of  those other disabilities, but it is not a causal factor. With autism, all the  normal rules are suspended.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">How can a person teach or live with someone who cannot  process or cope with social situations? How do we ensure that people with  autism are not excluded? We can start by recognising autism as a social and communication  disability. That is a vital step in moving forward. It is only then that we  will be able to see adjustments and ensure that protections are put in place.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  Does the Member agree with me that there is a need for specialised social  workers who have the understanding and the skills that are required to work  with young people and adults with autism?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  I could not agree more with the Member.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am running out of time, and I want to make a comment  about the parental lobby, as many parents and carers were on the steps of  Stormont this morning. We must put on record our strong support for those  parents and thank them for their continued lobbying. Not for the first time,  they came here to lobby us because they want no less than the protection of  their children&rsquo;s rights. Since I was elected to the Assembly in 2007, the  autism lobby in my constituency of Mid Ulster has been very strong and has been  the first at my door. Two women in particular &mdash; Ann McIlvenny and Cecilia  O&rsquo;Hagan &mdash; have worked tirelessly on autism issues across Mid Ulster and have  provided immense support to parents in the area.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind the Member that she was allocated 10 minutes in which to  speak; she can slow down. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Do not tell her to slow down, Mr Deputy Speaker. She said that she would give  way to me at the end of her winding-up speech if there is time.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Continue, Mrs O&rsquo;Neill.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker &mdash; a common criticism of me is that I speak too  quickly.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I make it clear to the House that we need to recognise that  lack of support and care for parents of children with autism leads to high  stress levels among them. Therefore, we need to do all that we can to  counteract that and support them.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A number of Members referred to the need to support adults  with autism. Again, I welcome the attention that has been brought to that issue  today. We also need to focus our attention on adults with autism.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Several Members spoke about early intervention and  diagnosis. Ian McCrea referred to the fact that some commentators have said  that diagnosis is a label that perhaps prevents inclusion. However, &ldquo;diagnosis&rdquo;  is not a dirty word &mdash; it gives direction to parents in seeking support and  signposts services and easily identifiable needs. Early intervention is the key  to assisting children with autism. The Keyhole programme of early intervention,  which was mentioned earlier, has been proven internationally. Despite that  fact, the programme is not provided comprehensively across the North. If it  could be applied here, that would ensure that there is a mechanism for all  parents to access whatever types of interventions they think appropriate for  their children.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The comments made by the UUP about the centre of excellence  at Middletown  were said, perhaps, to try to deflect attention away from the fact that its  members stood up in the House today and said that they will not support the  autism lobby for legislation. That is unfortunate. I think that John  McCallister commented that the lobby is categorically not needed. I do not know  how he has the expertise to make that assumption.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I wear the same badge; I have the same tie, and I have been involved in the  issue from the start. Therefore, I categorically reject the allegation that  people are trying to play politics with the issue. Frankly, I find the  allegation distasteful. The Minister of Education was challenged about Middletown. Members of  the Committee for Education talked about the centre. The Minister of Health,  Social Services and Public Safety stood here and said that he does not need  legislation, because he has all the legislation he needs. If any Member can  point to an area in which something needs to be done but that the Minister does  not have the power to address, speak now and the Minister will seek that  legislation. That is the challenge. This is not about politics, it is about  action.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  I am going to move into the reasons why we need autism legislation. I say to  the Member that I find it distasteful that his party will not support the  autism legislation today.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Much work has been done by the autism lobby to progress the  Autism Bill, which will enshrine, in legislation, the rights and entitlements  of those in the autistic spectrum. I remind Members that that is not a  privilege for autistic children and adults; it is a right. The legislation will  place a legal imperative on those responsible to work together to provide  services; it will ensure that parents are given official recognition of their  child&rsquo;s disability and it will ensure and establish foundation principles and  guidance to establish a cross-cutting strategy. With the best will in the  world, the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety &mdash; who has  taken action, which we welcome &mdash; has no control over the other Departments.  Therefore, a legal imperative is needed so that all Departments have to work  together in order to improve services for people with autism.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion &mdash; I am not going to have time to refer to the  Minister&rsquo;s comments &mdash; I commend the Minister of Health, Social Services and  Public Safety and the Minister of Education for their work in improving the  lives of individuals living with autism. However, the challenge is this:  autistic spectrum disorder does not fit into the current system &mdash; there remains  inequality of provision. Autism is an invisible disability that needs attention  and needs addressed now. A number of motions on the issue have been passed  unanimously in the House; however, action has been lacking. We need to see  action and we need to send a clear message to the parents and carers of those  with autism that this is an equality issue and that we are going to see it  through. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I am afraid that the Member&rsquo;s time really is up now.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly expresses its concern at the high rate of  autism and the consequent development challenges to Government and  non-Government agencies across health, education and social care; and commends  the United Nations designation of 2 April as world autism awareness day and the  invitation to all Member States to observe this day annually to raise public  awareness of autism.</p>
      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="6"></a>Private Members&rsquo; Business</p>
      <p class="H4StageHeading">Sales of Alcohol to Minors</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30  minutes for the debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes to  propose and 10 minutes to make a winding-up speech. All other Members who wish  to speak will have five minutes.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  beg to move</p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly calls on the Minister for Social  Development to introduce a series of measures on off-licence sales of alcohol  to reduce its availability to minors.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It does not give me any great joy to bring this motion to  the House. As I researched the issue, what I found became quite scary. I have  to say to the Minister for Social Development that we are sitting on a time  bomb, and we need action soon because there are major problems with regard to  young people and the consumption of alcohol, and how that affects our society.  First, they are damaging their own health. Secondly, they are jeopardising  their own future. Thirdly, they are damaging the social infrastructure that we  enjoy.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The statistics are quite alarming. I do not normally make  much reference to notes when I am speaking, but today I will make considerable  reference to them because there are so many statistics on the issue. For  example, 17 million units of alcohol are consumed by minors &mdash; youngsters  between the ages of 11 and 17 &mdash; each week. That is equivalent to 1&middot;7 million  bottles of wine or 6&middot;9 million pints of beer. By the age of 16, most children  have consumed alcohol; in fact, when 360,000 children in the United Kingdom  were surveyed, they said that they had been drunk the previous week, and 3&middot;5  million of our young people have consumed alcohol.</p>
      <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Molloy] in the Chair)</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In Northern    Ireland in 2006-07, just short of 400 young  people were admitted to hospital as a consequence of alcohol consumption. That  is not the figure for those who attended accident and emergency units but the  number who were actually admitted to hospital.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">What are the consequences for society? Clearly, the  resultant antisocial behaviour is a consequence for society. We saw the  consequences of alcohol abuse on Saturday, although the people involved were  adults rather than young people or children. Nonetheless, much of the violence  that took place on Saturday was related to the abuse of alcohol, and many of  those involved will have started drinking when they were young.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Of the 10- to 17-year-olds who regularly drink, 39% have committed  a violent offence, 34% have committed a theft and 17% have committed criminal  damage. In 2004-05, 359 young offenders in Hydebank Wood Young Offenders Centre  admitted that they had a dependency on alcohol, 468 admitted an addiction to  either drugs or alcohol and only 58 could say that they were not dependent on  either alcohol or drugs. That is an indication of the link between the abuse of  alcohol and violent crime carried out by young people. When we hear stories  from our senior citizens and from other young people who have been targeted by  some of those individuals, no one can deny that we have a major problem in our  towns and cities.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is concerning that 27% of young people indicated that  they had bought alcohol themselves, so they did not need an older person to  purchase alcohol for them. We need to take cognisance of that, because not  enough is being done on that front; I hope to hear some positive suggestions  from the Minister. In 2002, one licensee was prosecuted and convicted of  selling alcohol to a minor. In 2003, 2004 and 2005 there were no convictions,  and, in 2006, there was one conviction.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Do not dare tell me that enough is being done when just two  people from the licensed trade have been prosecuted in the past five years, and  27% of young people who say that they are consuming alcohol say that they are  buying it themselves, because those two facts do not stand up. Evidently,  something has to be done.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As for the damage that these young people are doing to  their bodies, I will quote some of the adverse consequences that the Chief  Medical Officer, Sir Liam Donaldson, cited in his &lsquo;Draft Guidance on the Consumption  of Alcohol by Children and Young People&rsquo;:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Young people are not immune to the chronic diseases  and conditions associated with excess alcohol consumption in adults, and deaths  from liver disease are now occurring at younger ages.</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">Adolescents and young people who drink and drive, or  allow themselves to be carried by a drink driver, are more likely to be  involved in a car accident.</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">Adolescents and young people who drink alcohol are  more likely to sustain an injury, often as a result of an assault.</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">Alcohol abuse in adolescence, during a developmentally  sensitive period, poses a particular danger to the emerging brain faculties of  executive functioning and long term memory.</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">Adolescents are likely to be more vulnerable to adults  to both subtle brain damage and long lasting cognitive deficits following  alcohol exposure.</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">Alcohol may increase feelings of depression.</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">Stress/anxiety based drinking is associated with  long-term and more severe negative outcomes.</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">There is a relationship between adolescent alcohol use  and mental health problems.</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">Alcohol consumption during an evening may affect a  child&rsquo;s performance at school on the following day.</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">There are associations between alcohol consumption and  subsequent behaviour with peers and friends. Excessive alcohol can be  detrimental to a young person being able to maintain friendships.</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">Alcohol consumption can have a detrimental effect on  young people&rsquo;s short term educational performance.</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">Alcohol consumption by young people, particularly  students, is more likely to make them vulnerable to being the victims of crime.</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">Alcohol may make some young people more likely to  display aggressive behaviour, although it is likely that other factors such as  their personality and family life will play a role.</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">Alcohol consumption is associated with: not using a  condom during a young person&rsquo;s first sexual encounter; an increased likelihood  of having sex at a younger age; unprotected sex; teenage pregnancy and the  likelihood of contracting sexually transmitted diseases.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The case for the damage to the individuals is clear. The  case for the damage to society is clear. The case for the absence of  qualitative work that is being done to reduce alcohol consumption is also  clear.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  has set out a strategy for 2006-2011 to address the misuse of alcohol. That  strategy is based very strongly on education &mdash; that is fair enough, but it is  not enough.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I suggest that we examine several possibilities. First, I  believe that there should be no sale of alcohol to people under the age of 21.  The establishment of such a measure would help to tackle the problem of young  people obtaining alcohol. That has already been done in the United States of America, it is being looked at  in Scotland,  and we could take a lead on that issue.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Off-licences should not be allowed to sell alcohol in bags  that are not labelled with their name. It is strange that nearly every company  except off-licences wants to advertise their names by labelling bags.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There should be a differential pricing structure in respect  of pubs and off-licences. Promotions by many off-licences and supermarkets  encourage a considerable amount of alcohol to be consumed. For example, one  supermarket in December 2008 took a &pound;22 million loss-leading strategy on the  sale of alcohol. Conseq&shy;uentially, far more of it was sold. In Scandinavian  countries in particular, where alcohol is more expensive, less of it is sold.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The police should have greater powers of confiscation,  whereby the drink does not have to be opened. If someone who is underage has  drink on them, the police should have the power to confiscate all the drink  that they have. There must be stronger regulation of outlets that sell drink.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I had to be in the Royal Victoria   Hospital with a relative  earlier this year, and over half of the people in the accident and emergency  department in midweek had injured themselves as a result of alcohol. We must do  something about alcohol, and we must do it now.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I welcome the opportunity to speak  in what is a very important debate, and I thank the proposer for the motion.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As the Member pointed out, there has been a marked change  in the patterns of drinking among young people over the past 10 years.  Statistics show that more and more young people are misusing alcohol. Children  have started drinking as young as 11 in Ireland,  and Ireland as a whole has  one of the highest levels of binge drinking among the 15 to 16 age group in Europe. One need only take a look at our streets during  the weekend or in a holiday period to see the level of alcohol misuse,  particularly among young people.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Alcohol misuse can have consequences for young people  themselves, their families and the community in general. Young people are more  vulnerable to suffering physical, emotional and social harm from drinking  alcohol, and it can lead to their having mental-health problems or becoming  involved in antisocial activity. There are also links between heavy binge  drinking and violent crime.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The number of children in treatment for alcohol misuse is  also on the increase. Therefore, there is a real need for young people who have  alcohol-misuse problems to get residential service and care and the help and  support that they need to overcome their addiction. However, we must also look  at innovative ways in which to tackle underage drinking and at providing  alternatives for younger people.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Colin area of my West Belfast  constituency has a midnight football project that has been running very  successfully for a number of years &mdash; people from the community sector give  their time free on a Friday night to bring teams of local young people together  to take part in competitions. That has worked very well, and we need more of  those intervention projects. It is not enough to say that we must tackle  underage drinking; we must be realistic and have alternative activities for  those young people. While there are a number of local initiatives involving  statutory, community and political representatives working together, it is  clear that more must be done to provide such activities.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">However, we must also use existing legislation more  vigorously and introduce further legislation, where necessary, in order to stop  on-street drinking, which has become a major problem in most communities. There  is evidence of a link between the number of outlets selling alcohol in an area  and the level of drink-related problems. There is also a connection between the  price and consumption of alcohol.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is, therefore, a clear onus on off-licences and  supermarkets that sell alcohol to ensure that they do so in a responsible  manner. Last year, our party brought a motion to the Assembly that called for  off-licences to be compelled to label their carrier bags so that the sources of  alcohol for young people were clearly identified &mdash; an initiative that worked  very well several years ago, when some local off-licences in my constituency  voluntarily participated in such a scheme.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Drinks promotions must also be more controlled &mdash;  particularly offers that encourage multiple purchasing &mdash; because evidence shows  that young people are particularly influenced by specific alcoholic drinks, and  if those can be obtained cheaply they will buy even more, which may up in the  hands of very vulnerable young people.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We must all be realistic, because adolescence is a period  in which young people begin to experiment with alcohol and when they can be  influenced by more sinister elements in society. It is also a period during  which choices that they make can have a long-term impact on the course of their  lives. There is a respons&shy;ibility on all of us &mdash; parents, Governments, schools,  communities, police and the drinks industry &mdash; to ensure that the scourge of  underage drinking is tackled and that young people have positive influences  when they make life choices.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We must consider putting new initiatives in place,  including the provision of more intervention projects such as midnight soccer  and the opening of youth centres late into the evening and at weekends, where  trained people can be on hand for young people to talk to about any problems  that may lead to alcohol misuse. For many young people, alcohol misuse can be a  symptom of a wider problem.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, there are short- and longer-term measures that  we must put in place if we are seriously to make a difference in tackling  underage and on-street drinking, which have become too acceptable and create  problems for individuals, their families and the community in general. I  support the motion.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Armstrong</strong>:  The motion relates to an issue of great importance &mdash; the sale of alcohol to  minors &mdash; and it is another example of the need for joined-up government that  involves the Departments responsible for Health, Social Development and  Education.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Few could argue that alcohol abuse is not a real problem in  Northern Ireland  and in wider British society. Above all, it affects young people, particularly  females. The UK has some of  the highest levels of drunkenness in Europe, and Northern Ireland is not exempt.  Much media attention has focused on the growth of binge drinking. Many young  people, regardless of whether they have reached the legal age for alcohol  consumption, drink a great deal, and they seem to consider that drinking  themselves into a state of near oblivion is part of a good night&rsquo;s craic.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am not a killjoy; I too enjoy a social drink. However, I  am scared by what I see at closing time on Saturday nights on the streets in  towns and cities and by the problem that faces society. Last year, the British  Medical Association (BMA) highlighted the problem in its report, &lsquo;Alcohol  Misuse: Tackling the UK Epidemic&rsquo;. According to the BMA, 11 is the average age  at which the first alcoholic drink is taken in Northern Ireland, and the greatest  increase in drinking occurs between the ages of 11 and 13. An incredible 80% of  all 16-year-olds have taken a drink. That is scandalous; they are children.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Such a state of affairs has major health and safety  implications, because the consequences are short and long term. Alcohol  consumption, particularly when heavy and prolonged, is associated with a wide  range of medical conditions and is a significant cause of premature death  worldwide.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Excessive alcohol consumption is linked to domestic  violence, road-traffic accidents, cancer, heart attacks and liver disease.  Alcohol abuse is associated with crime, violence and antisocial behaviour, and  it has an adverse impact on family and community life. Drunk people are often  victims of crime because they are incapable of thinking straight and are unable  to defend themselves. There is a real risk that the dangerous level of drinking  by young people today will set the pattern for their behaviour as young adults  and will have serious repercussions on their long-term health and well-being.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A co-ordinated approach is required, because the current  policies clearly do not work. It is not enough to educate young people on the  effects of alcohol through health-promotion and education programmes. That  message is not getting through. The fact that so many underage drinkers have  easy access to alcohol indicates that something is badly wrong. The  availability of alcohol that is sometimes even cheaper than water must be  addressed. The law must be enforced properly and rigorously, and those who sell  alcohol to underage drinkers must be punished severely. The crisis has been  ongoing for some time, and we can no longer sit back and do nothing.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>: I  support the motion and thank those Members who tabled it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Strong evidence exists that the consumption of alcohol by  young people is on the rise. Children who are aged as young as 11 are drinking  to excess, and the fact that some who are aged 14 or 15 are being identified as  regular drinkers means that alcohol abuse is a huge problem. As Edwin Poots  said, it could be described as a ticking time bomb that is damaging health,  families and lives. It could also be said that, as a society, we are drowning  in drink. Is it any wonder that many young people abuse alcohol?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">One of the biggest worries for parents must be &mdash; and should  be &mdash; underage drinking and alcohol abuse. The Department of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety reminds us daily of the frightening and fatal  repercussions of binge drinking and alcohol abuse. Unfortunately, no single  answer can solve the problem of underage drinking. Some options are worth  considering. For example, it is important to educate and train off-licence  staff and proprietors, and it is advisable to establish responsible management  policies and adequate supervision.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Robust identification checks are very important, and they  should be used to deter underage people from purchasing alcohol. There should  also be sufficient numbers of staff working in the evenings and at weekends  when most of the alcohol is purchased. Up-to-date information about the laws  and penalties needs to be passed on to licensees to highlight the need to avoid  some sales and to remind them of their responsibilities, as well as to ensure  that they know that they will be prosecuted if they do not adhere to the laws.  In fact, they must be prosecuted.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As Members will know, illegal access to alcohol is rife  across Northern Ireland.  There are persistent offenders, and, unfortunately, the enforcement rates with  regard to underage sales of alcohol are low. Therefore, there must be more  enforcement. All retailers, including off-licences, need to work more closely  with the PSNI and with Trading Standards Service to ensure that best practice  is shared on how we can best reduce opportunities for young people to buy  alcohol.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The effective delivery of education regarding the damage  that alcohol causes to our young people must be delivered in schools and  colleges. We also have to promote more sport in school and encourage health and  fitness, and we should encourage young people to take part in sport for its own  sake &mdash; not everyone is into competitive sport. We have to get our young people  active for various health reasons, but, particularly, so that they may become  more concerned and think more about what they put into their bodies.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The impact of alcohol abuse is having a crippling effect on  NHS resources, and it is getting worse. Excessive drinking is primarily an  issue for the Department of Health, but it needs a cross-departmental and  organisational approach, with input from the Department for Social Development  in relation to trading standards, including off-licence sales of alcohol; from  the Department of Education; from district councils for the enforcement of  by-laws; from the PSNI; from the Court Service; as well as from health,  voluntary and community organisations, residents groups and churches; and, of  course, from the parents. The parents are an essential element, and they must  be involved in any strategy to tackle the problem.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Alcohol plays too significant a part in our culture, in our  society and in our economy, and, given the potentially damaging impact of  alcohol misuse for our young people, we need that multifaceted approach.  Underage drinking happens not only via off-licences, but via supermarkets, pubs  and clubs, and that is why we need a wider approach.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Although today&rsquo;s motion addresses underage drinking, many  of our concerns apply equally to alcohol abuse generally, but that debate is  for another day. The Minister for Social Development is committed to maximising  the contribution that liquor licensing legislation can make to tackling alcohol  abuse in underage people, and, along with the Committee for Social Development  and the Executive, I have no doubt that she will consider the best way forward.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>:  Underage drinking is an increasing problem in Northern Ireland, and I continually  hear complaints about it in my constituency. It is disturbing to learn that, on  average, young people take their first drink at under 12 years of age. Children  say that they have easy access to cheap drink through purchasing from  supermarkets or off-licences. Sometimes, they get it from proxy purchasing by  irresponsible adults who buy drinks on their behalf. It is well evidenced that  underage drinking causes not only health and behavioural problems for the  individuals, but social problems for all of us.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Alcohol abuse by young people can lead to ill health, poor  school attainment, antisocial behaviour, crime, accidents, injuries, rape and  teenage pregnancies, all of which place burdens on public services, which  should be put to better use.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister for Social Development&rsquo;s proposed Bill to  amend the Licensing (Northern    Ireland) Order 1996 was announced in  November 2008. It set out a range of new proposals to update liquor licensing,  and I very much welcome the proposed reform.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The proposed new law will provide a number of measures that  are aimed at tackling underage drinking. First, it will give the police and the  courts powers to close licensed premises immediately, and for up to 24 hours.  Secondly, the proposed penalty points system will lead to suspensions of liquor  licences for premises. Thirdly, the introduction of a new statutory  proof-of-age scheme &mdash; and the compulsory display of specified signage about  that new scheme &mdash; will make it clear that shop and pub staff have the right to  see ID from purchasers if they are in doubt about their age. Such new steps  must be rigorously enforced.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, as has been the case with the police in  England and Wales for the past six years, the Police Service of Northern  Ireland should also be given the power to carry out test purchasing, which is  conducted with a code of best practice and takes into account the participants&rsquo;  safety and welfare. That will discourage licensed premises, supermarkets and  off-licences from selling alcohol to underage drinkers.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Test-purchasing operations in Great Britain have led to a large  number of warnings and prosecutions, and it has been proven that such schemes  contribute signi&shy;ficantly to the reduction of drink-related crime and disorder.  Belfast City Council has already set the precedent here by undertaking test  purchases on sales of cigarettes to children under the age of 16, while the PSNI  also carried out a test-purchasing initiative in 2004 to good effect, which  received support from the public.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Apart from law enforcement, it is also important to  encourage the retail sector to observe their social responsibilities by not  selling alcoholic drinks to minors. The owners and staff need training in  following guidelines to ask for proof of identity, as a matter of course.  Furthermore, if IT reminders can be built into cash tills to prompt staff to  check proof of identity when flavoured alcoholic drinks are purchased, such  devices should be used.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Underage drinking is a scourge on our society, but it is  not only the responsibility of Government. Parents, teachers, youth workers,  the drinks industry and communities must also work together to guide our young  people, and provide them with positive role models.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Social Development (Mr Hilditch)</strong>: The  Committee for Social Development considered the Minister&rsquo;s proposals for liquor  licensing at its meeting of 25 September 2008. With the rest of the House, Committee  members listened with interest to the Minister&rsquo;s statement on that subject on  17 November 2008.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The abuse of alcohol is a blight on families, communities  and many parts of society throughout Northern Ireland. The Committee was  unanimous in expressing its concern about the growing excesses in the  consumption of alcohol, particularly among young people, and it agreed that  steps needed to be taken to make a real difference and to address the problem.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee largely welcomed the Minister&rsquo;s proposals on  liquor licensing, particularly the intro&shy;duction of a statutory proof-of-age  scheme. Members of the Committee felt that such a scheme was necessary, but not  sufficient, to curtail alcohol consumption among minors, and that the scheme  must be backed up by test-purchase arrangements. Under those arrangements,  young people who clearly look underage are sent into off-licences by the PSNI  to test whether illegal purchases can be made. Although members of the  Committee recognised the need for test purchases, they also expressed concerns  on the safety protocols that must be in place to protect those young people.  Notwith&shy;standing that reservation, the Committee supports the idea of a  statutory proof-of-age scheme.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Members of the Committee raised concerns about the practice  of proxy purchasing. That is when adults purchase alcohol on behalf of  children. It is clear that a statutory proof-of-age scheme will not eliminate  that problem and may lead to an increase in the practice of proxy purchasing.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee has recommended to the Minister that she  augment her liquor-licence proposals so that the PSNI could ban from particular  off-licences those individuals who are engaged in proxy purchasing.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Members of the Committee highlighted the successes of the  community off-sales initiative (COSI) in Belfast.  They believe that that initiative should be used to supplement the Minister&rsquo;s  statutory proof-of-age scheme, and they support a clampdown on the practice of  proxy purchasing on behalf of underage drinkers.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee was exercised by the use of alcohol  promotions. Members said that cheap alcohol, which is sometimes cheaper than  soft drinks or bottled water, leads to more alcohol consumption among young  people. Some Committee members recommended minimum pricing for alcohol, but the  Committee recognised the difficulty of fixing minimum prices without there  being corresponding arrangements in other jurisdictions.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee supports the motion and urges the Minister to  bring forward her liquor-licence proposals and to consider amendments to  proposals that have been made in light of the comments of the Committee for  Social Development.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Beidh m&eacute; ag labhairt ar son an  r&uacute;in.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I speak in support of the broad thrust of the motion,  because we have to take steps to ensure that alcohol is not found in the hands  of minors. That goes without saying. Members who have spoken have outlined a  variety of reasons that alcohol should not be sold to minors, and each of those  reasons is valid. It leads to crime among young people and results in  antisocial behaviour. Underage drinking has health implications, and the age profile  of people drinking alcohol is reducing by the year.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We have to avoid the situation where we think that the sale  of alcohol to minors is the responsibility of a single agency or that a single  law will prevent the phenomenon. We have to find other ways to tackle the problem  and to ensure that the emphasis on dealing with the matter is not reduced to  being the responsibility of one agency, the people who sell alcohol, or the  people who are tasked with making sure that it is not being sold to minors. We  have to find a more collaborative and collective way of doing that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Last year, an Assembly Ad Hoc Committee examined some of  the issues to do with on-street drinking and problems relating to the  designated places in which it was impossible to seize alcohol from minors &mdash; and  even from people who are not minors. The whole problem of the sale of alcohol  to minors should not be seen as a single issue.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Of course, people who sell alcohol have a respons&shy;ibility  to ensure that they do not sell it to minors. They must do everything that is  in their power and follow the letter of their licence to ensure that they do  not do so. The same point should be made in respect of enforcement. Measures  should be taken; it should not be seen as a nuisance or as something that is  impossible to do. Many things can be done.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to return to the idea of a collective and  collaborative approach and look at some examples that are best placed in good  practice. They do not need legislation, but they do require some application.  For example, for the past four years, the civic alcohol forum in Derry city has been chaired by the mayor. That forum  comprises interested parties and agencies across the board: individuals who are  involved in working with young people; representatives from the vintner trade;  the PSNI; representatives from political parties; and community  representatives. It has a wide remit in dealing with minors, and it is  innovative in its approach.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In the past number of years, we have seen the effect that  the forum has had in the city, particularly during the Halloween festival and  other on-street festivals, during which alcohol abuse &mdash; by young people in  particular &mdash; was a phenomenon. The forum is trying to create a climate in which  young people realise that they can go on the streets and enjoy themselves  without having to drink alcohol. Young people follow that example.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">5.00 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Other initiatives need to be taken also. Edwin Poots, and  my colleague Jennifer McCann, spoke about such initiatives, and the issue has  been debated in the Assembly previously. One initiative that I have seen  working in Derry involves off-licences selling  alcohol in bags with the store label on them so that people can ascertain where  the alcohol came from. Those stores do not do that because of a statutory requirement;  they do it as a matter of civic concern.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">One major off-licence in Derry  has had a hotline in place for the past three or four years. Many people have  used it, such as parents, neighbours and those living in the vicinity of the  off-licence. It has had an impact: many young people now say that they now do  not go to such establishments. Of course, that can also create an issue of  displacement &mdash; if young people know not to go to one store, they will go  elsewhere. However, the principle remains important &mdash; if people apply  themselves, they can come up with measures to deal with the problem.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Where such initiatives work, we should be encouraging  people to continue with them. Another example is that local taxi firms, through  a sort of self-proclaimed charter, do not take young people to off-licences.  Young people going to off-licences and then congregating outside them was a  phenomenon in the city in which taxi firms sometimes unwittingly took part.  Those taxi firms have now taken steps to ensure that that does not happen.  Similarly, they have a charter &mdash; again, self-proclaimed &mdash; regarding deliveries,  in that they do not perform deliveries unless the customers are regular  customers whom they know to be of a responsible age.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Member to bring his remarks to a close.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  I am sorry, I did not realise that my time had run out.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  I thank the Members who brought the motion before the House. However, there is  something regrettable about society if we find ourselves in the position of  having to bring a motion such as this before the House. It is obvious that  there is something wrong that needs to be addressed, and it is patently obvious  that that has not been done to date.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am firmly of the school of thought that lays a lot of the  responsibility and blame on parents; I believe that when law and order breaks  down on the streets, it has already broken down in the home. All parents have a  big responsibility, as do those who sell alcohol to minors &mdash; that is, people  who are under 18 years of age. At times, they do not fully take that  responsibility on board, and the issue has to be addressed at that level also.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">When I was looking into this subject &mdash; and I am sorry that  I did not get as much time to prepare for the debate as I would have liked &mdash; I  found that some research material makes very startling reading. Around the House,  Members have constantly brought questions to the Minister of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety and, perhaps to a lesser extent, the Minister for  Social Development, in relation to the sale of alcohol to minors.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Just before the Deputy Speaker called me to speak, I was  reading information on how, at Christmas time, minors, or young people, were  told to enjoy their Christmas, but to &ldquo;know your limits&rdquo;. There is something  wrong with a message that says &ldquo;know your limits&rdquo;, because, as far as I am  concerned, the limits for a minor are zero &mdash; they should not touch alcohol.  That is the message that needs to be got out to minors, not that they should go  out and enjoy themselves but know their limits, because that puts out the wrong  message altogether.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As I look through some of the material that I have been  gathering in relation to the debate, particularly information on some recent  court appearances, it is patently obvious that there is an enforcement issue,  and one that needs to be addressed at a social level. Very often, we say that  an issue needs to be addressed in schools, and we turn to teachers. Although this  issue does need to be addressed in schools, it also needs to be addressed in  the home. As elected representatives to this Assembly, we should never be  afraid to say that. We always seem to want to place responsibility at some  other place or with someone else, but responsibility starts in the home.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Recently, I read in a newspaper that children as young as  11 years of age are getting access to alcohol, which is something that Carmel  Hanna also said during her contribution. What are parents doing while their  11-year-old child is accessing alcohol? Responsibility does not always lie with  someone else; there is a responsibility in the home.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As I looked through the research papers, I saw that my  colleague Lord Browne had asked the Minister of Health and Social Services  whether he would consider raising the age for buying alcohol from 18 to 21. I  wish that the Minister had been more positive and said that yes, he would, as  that is what should be happening.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">My colleague David Hilditch asked the Minister a similar  question about the misuse of alcohol by minors. Members have asked questions  about alcohol statistics, and the answers reveal that the numbers run into  hundreds. Jim Shannon asked for a breakdown for each constituency, and the  startling figure that came back was a total of 670. That is 670 young people  who have had access to alcohol or who have a criminal record as a result.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have information to hand, which I will not read out,  about the number of youths under 17 years of age who cannot be named for consuming  alcohol and intoxicating liquor in public &mdash; they are described as youths who  cannot be named. There is a challenge for the whole spectrum of society to  admit that there is a problem that must be tackled directly by the Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety and the Minister for Social  Development.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  There is no doubt that there is a problem with minors drinking &mdash; particularly  binge drinking &mdash; and the problem is not just for them but for society. Mr Poots  referred to the number of people who end up in accident and emergency  departments. There is also the amount of time that police spend on  drink-related matters over a weekend and for anyone who has been on a response  team, the question is not whether we have a problem but how we fix it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">This may be a mea culpa, but I drank before the age of 18,  and I wonder how many other Members in the Chamber had a drink before they were  18. Before I reached the heady age of 18, it was almost a fixation among young  people to try to get a drink, because that was part of socialising. One should  not underestimate the powerful drive in adolescents for trying to get a drink &mdash;  it is part of their culture. However, we must find a way to curtail such  activity. Now that I am slightly older and slightly wiser, I realise that it  was not the best plan.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">One could start by looking at the issue of control and  consider more draconian ID cards &mdash; photo ID or fingerprints &mdash; and the legal age  for drinking could be raised to 21.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Recently, I introduced a motion in front of about 150  children at W5, where I proposed that the legal age limit should be raised from  18 to 21, in which I was opposed by someone from advertising. A vote was taken  before the debate, which I lost 132 to 18. After I had given my best pitch about  raising the age limit to 21 and had finished talking, I had reduced the deficit  to 112 v 38 &mdash; I had saved 20 people. That shows that there is an issue.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In this House we talk about engaging with young people.  Perhaps the legal age for drinking should be raised to 21; perhaps the age of  sexual consent should be 17; and perhaps the voting age should be reduced to  16. I hear many people say that they can vote but they cannot drink.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">About a week ago, I attended at a meeting in the  Presbyterian centre, where one of the young people said that we should reduce  the legal age for drinking. Jim Fitzpatrick asked her to what age it should be  reduced, and she replied that it should be reduced to 12 years of age. There  were 350 young people at the meeting, and they all cheered. The danger of  introducing legislation to raise the legal age at which one can drink is that  we make drinking seem more attractive to children.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Where I agree absolutely with Lord Morrow &mdash; and I am in  great danger of always having to follow him because I am always agreeing with  him, which is, I think, more of a problem for me than for him &mdash; is about the  attitudes of parents. The issue comes down to parents. I am sorry, but there is  an issue about rites of passage. There is an issue whereby people force drink  on young people, and say: &ldquo;Go on, son, have a drink&rdquo;. I do not know whether we  have all done that, but we have certainly all seen it &mdash; and what are people to  think of that?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">So, one comes to some of the issues that might be  addressed. I have heard people say that this is more than just the  responsibility of the Minister for Social Development. I do think that a  holistic approach is necessary. It is, perhaps, something on which the Office  of the First and deputy First Minister (OFMDFM) should take the lead. There is  the issue about there not being enough facilities for our young people. Where  do they go? What do they do at night? Youth clubs close at 9.00 pm, or they do  not open at weekends.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">More needs to be put into sport. More needs to be done with  regard to volunteering. Those were the volunteers about whom I spoke who came  along and talked about those issues. I really do think that that whole issue is  the forgotten sector. The youth sector is, perhaps, something that we, as an  Assembly, ought to promote and fund and do more with &#8213; not just because it is youth,  but because alcohol and other risky behaviour have such a long-term impact.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Our schools should start to consider informing our young  people about what is actually going on with the development of the brain. The  more that I learn about these things, the more I realise how long it takes for  all of the brain&rsquo;s neural wiring to complete. That has to be explained to young  people, and they will work it out for themselves.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I agree that we do not want drink to be cheap. We do not  want dial-a-drink, which is when a person phones up Sainsbury&rsquo;s and gets drink  delivered to their house, or, as Raymond McCartney said, in Londonderry  taxis deliver drink. We do not want advertising, and we do not want pop groups.  However, we have to treat people responsibly. I would urge a holistic approach,  and perhaps the Minister will raise that with her Executive colleagues with  regard to the way forward.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  This motion is very restrictive in its approach to the subject of alcohol abuse  by minors. The motion does not, in my opinion, reflect the full extent of the  problem and the full extent of the approach that must be taken to resolve the  issue. It is based primarily on regulation, and regulation is fair enough. All  of us in this House would agree that regulation should be improved, applied  rigorously and tightened up. I think that everyone agrees with that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">However, that will not resolve the problem of alcohol abuse  by minors. The experience in Europe &mdash; in Spain,  France, Italy, Greece  and in even Croatia  &mdash; is that people take drink and, very largely, behave. The only people who I  have seen misbehaving with drink in countries such as Spain and France are the Irish or, indeed,  the British. There is something in our culture &mdash; whether that be Irish or  British &mdash; that tolerates the abuse of alcohol. I do not understand why that is  so. Therefore, there is a cultural problem that has to be addressed by way of  education and other means, although I do not know how. However, the problem is  more than simply one of regulation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There have been some innovative ideas. People have talked  about raising the legal drinking age to 21. I do not know whether simply  raising the age will resolve the problem. There is a problem at present with  identifying young people. It is difficult for people in off-licences to be  certain that a young person is of the age to consume or purchase alcohol. It  has been suggested that we brand bags so that we know where the drink has come  from.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">5.15 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If, say, Mr Poots had an off-licence, the bags would be  &ldquo;Poots&rsquo;s&rdquo; bags. I see that Ms McCann has left the Chamber, but if she owned an  off-licence, the bags would be &ldquo;Jennifer McCann&rsquo;s&rdquo; bags. Of course, people will  be mischievous and mix the bags up, and, in such circumstances, we will not be  able to identify where the drink has come from. People will deliberately  confuse the issue. Therefore, I do not think that there is any simple solution  by way of regulation.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  have listened to the Member for three-and-a-half minutes, and his argument  seems to be that there is no point in doing anything. I suggest that it is  better to do something than to do nothing.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  Mr Poots has misunderstood or misheard. I said that regulation is important and  that it is a feature of the whole regime that one would adopt to tackle the  problem of alcohol abuse by minors. However, it is only one aspect of the  problem. The cultural aspect is very important, and addressing it involves  education. Alcohol abuse is a public-health problem, and, again, we need  education to address it. My point is that regulation alone will not solve the  problem. The Minister has wisely proposed a statutory proof-of-age scheme, and  that is important. It is also important that penalty points be introduced to  penalise off-licences that serve young people. Similarly, test purchasing is a  necessary weapon.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">However, a more fundamental problem is the relatively low  price of drink. What are we doing about that? Indeed, does the Assembly have  the power to control the price of drink? I am not certain that we do, but we  can perhaps explore that matter. The price of drink has remained unchanged for  many years. Yes, it has gone up in actual figures, but, in real terms, the  price has remained fairly stable for a long time. In relative terms, drink is  quite cheap.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The problem arises from a degree of relative affluence in  our communities, whereby people have a relative amount of cash with which to  purchase cheap drink. That is a source of temptation for young people. We must  take a much broader view of the situation.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>:  There is no question about it: young people aged 12 and up &mdash; and sometimes even  younger &mdash; are being supplied with drink. We heard that fact mentioned in many  of today&rsquo;s speeches, and there can be no argument about it. Who is supplying  them? The answer is so-called friends, and, unfortunately, family members.  Indeed, as Lord Morrow pointed out, even parents are supplying drink to young  people.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If we think that that is not a serious problem, let us look  at the statistics: 48% of 10- to-17-year-olds obtain alcohol from their  parents. That is the scale of the problem with regard to parental  responsibility. Police officers in my constituency have carried out stings to find  out who is supplying drink to young people in areas where there are problems  with antisocial behaviour. Many times, those officers have reported to me that  it is the parents who are dropping their young people off in those areas. It is  the old Nimby situation; those parents do not want antisocial behaviour in  their own backyard, but they are quite content to drop their children off  somewhere else and allow a situation to develop there.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Is that an enormous problem for society? I believe that it  is. In my constituency, there are over 122 referrals to the youth-justice  system every month &mdash; all for alcohol-related problems and antisocial behaviour  occurring in Lagan   Valley.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I do not believe for one second that Lagan Valley  is any worse or better than any other constituency, but those are enormous  statistics. Alcohol is even being brought into schools, which have to face that  problem every day.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Alcohol misuse costs Northern Ireland approximately &pound;800  million a year, but what are the real costs that cannot be calculated in pounds  and pence? What about family members who suffer the consequences of what some  young people are doing? People who start so young do not learn how to drink  responsibly. A lot of them have huge difficulties with drink later in life, and  many families have to live with that massive problem. I have personal  experience of friends who got caught up in the circle of alcohol abuse, leading  to their premature death. That continues to happen, and it is a huge issue.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Is it acceptable, as the Minister of Health stated  yesterday, that alcohol is 64% cheaper in real terms than it was 30 years ago?  Is it acceptable for off-licences to not put labels on their bags? Why do some  off-licences not want labels on their bags? Tesco and Sainsbury&rsquo;s proudly  advertise on their carrier bags, but why do off-licences run away from doing  the same? Is it because they know full well where the drink is going?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Should the minimum age for drinking alcohol be raised to  21? We often hear about issues concerning ID cards; identification would not  eliminate the problem, but it would help. More specifically, should drink  advertisers be forced to match-fund the Health Service with the money that they  spend on alcohol advertise&shy;ments? Should alcohol advertisements have to contain  a health warning in large, bold font, similar to the warnings on cigarette  boxes? We need to look at the actions of the drinks industry if we are serious  about tackling the issue.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">What about the action that is taken against those who are  caught plying young people with drink? Such people cannot be let off with a  slap on the back of the hand, because that does not work. The fines and penalties  handed to those people must be increased if they are to work as a deterrent &mdash;  the current measures are not working. Every day, up to 13 teenagers are  admitted to hospital due to binge drinking, which is an 11% rise since the  mid-1990s. The current approach to educating young people about drink is not  working, and, therefore, I support the motion.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  I, too, support the motion. Mr Maginness criticised its wording, but I remind  him that he had an opportunity to table an amendment in advance of the debate,  which may have been helpful. I appreciate that the Minister for Social  Development is here to respond to the debate, but other Departments also need  to be involved and should not shirk responsibility for the matter.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We debated a similar motion in April last year &mdash; it does  not seem as long ago &mdash; that called on the Minister to introduce measures to  tackle the increasing levels of alcohol misuse. I realise, of course, that the  ills of society cannot be cured overnight. However, for some reason, there is a  sense of national pride and identity in the amount of alcohol that can be  drunk, and that filters down to our children. The Assembly needs to consider a  framework of measures to cut across Departments and deal with education,  treatment and enforcement measures.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As the twelfth Member to speak in the debate, there is very  little new that I can add. I do not intend to rehearse arguments on the impact  of underage drinking on healthcare, policing and our society in general, but a  number of improvements should be made. Surveys and research have cited attempts  to demonstrate maturity, peer pressure and rebellion against parents as among  the causes of underage drinking. However, we must also consider the impact of a  lack of parental supervision, inappropriate role models, and the way in which  alcohol is presented by the media in advertising, television programmes and  newspaper stories.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">One need only look at programmes such as &lsquo;Big Brother&rsquo;, in  which housemates are supplied with alcohol to encourage certain behaviour in  order to liven things up in the house and generate interest. That sets an  incredibly bad example to young people.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We must consider the outlets that supply alcohol. Are they  doing enough to ensure that what they sell does not make its way into the hands  of minors? Not only must IDs be checked more stringently but, as already  stated, legislation should be promulgated to ensure that alcohol is not sold at  a low price that makes it more accessible to minors. Supermarkets are bound by  competition laws that prevent them from fixing prices between them, but there  is nothing to stop Government introducing legislation to regulate alcohol  pricing.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Enforcement issues range from reserved matters &mdash; such as  the seizing of alcohol from minors and the manner in which alcohol-related  crime is dealt with in the courts &mdash; to prosecuting establishments that are guilty  of making alcohol available to minors, either through direct selling or  indirect supply, and tightening the licensing process to exclude repeat  offenders, thus placing the onus on vendors to take measures to prevent alcohol  from falling into the wrong hands. Licensing is a matter for DSD but, as Anna  Lo and other Members said, the police should be encouraged to use the powers at  their disposal, such as test purchases of alcohol, seizure of alcohol consumed  in a public place and the issue of fixed penalty notices &mdash; all of which are in  the Criminal Justice (Northern    Ireland) Order 2008.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The weekend before last, Jim Shannon and I had the  privilege of being on patrol with police in our constit&shy;uency. Drinking hot  spots are well known, and the police are doing all they can with limited  resources; that is another issue that should be addressed. Furthermore, I wish  to see an increase in prosecutions of establishments caught selling alcohol to  minors. Effective enforcement will ensure that off-licences and bars act much  more responsibly.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In the last debate in the Assembly on this subject, we  discussed measures implemented by Ards Borough Council, the police and the  Northern Ireland Housing Executive. I will spare Members a reiteration of what  was said and refer them instead to the Hansard report. At that time, I called  for such schemes to be rolled out across Northern Ireland, and today I  repeat that call.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We need to address a mindset that has become the norm in  our society and we must challenge it by whatever means at our disposal.  Education alone will not solve the problem, but it plays a vital role. Young  people need to be made aware of the dangers that alcohol presents not only to  themselves but to society in general. It is not an easy problem to tackle, but  successfully addressing it will be of immeasurable significance to society.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development (Ms Margaret Ritchie)</strong>: I am grateful to Edwin Poots and  Jim Shannon, as I am sure other Members are, for providing the Assembly with an  opportunity to discuss this important topic. I am also grateful to all the  other Members who have contributed to the debate. Like many, I agree that this  is not solely about regulation: we need an holistic approach that encompasses  public health, education and many other approaches.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The disgraceful scenes that we witnessed in the Holyland  area of South Belfast and those of last week referred to by Mr Poots leave us  in no doubt that there is an onus on Members, as public representatives, to  unite to tackle the scourge of alcohol abuse.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Alcohol abuse also goes on behind closed doors. I am  grateful to Mr Poots and Mr Shannon for bringing forward such an open-ended  motion. Most motions in this respect urge me and fellow Ministers to take  specific action to combat alcohol abuse, but this motion is completely  non-prescriptive.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">However, as Minister with responsibility for liquor  licensing legislation, I have been asked to make some unspecified changes to  our laws to guarantee resolution of a complex, cross-cutting social problem  that has bedevilled and continues to bedevil every jurisdiction in these  islands and further afield. That is a tall order, as I think all Members will  agree.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">5.30 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I was confident that the absence of clear recommend&shy;ations to  be explored in debate would not deter Members from coming up with a wide range  of ideas about what I should do. I have not been disappointed. I have heard  many points &mdash; many of them familiar &mdash; about many issues to do with  alcohol-related harm.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Some of those issues, and some of the solutions, fall  within my area of responsibility. The remainder, which form the large majority,  fall to other Executive or Whitehall Ministers and, in particular, to the  police. However, I recognise that combating underage drinking and  alcohol-related harm demands co-ordinated partnership working. I am happy to  restate my commit&shy;ment to maximising the contribution that liquor licensing and  neighbourhood renewal, which are my respons&shy;ibilities, can make &mdash; along with  other initiatives from the public, private and community sectors &mdash; to tackle  alcohol abuse by under-18s and others.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I draw Members&rsquo; attention to the fact that Mr Poots and Mr  Shannon first tabled the motion six months ago, in October 2008. Since then, I  am pleased to report, a lot of headway has been made on reforming and  strengthening licensing laws. It may be helpful if I take a moment to briefly  update the House on that progress.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will begin by touching on the proposed licensing and  registration of clubs (amendment) (Northern Ireland) Bill. For some  time, I have been convinced that stricter enforcement measures are urgently  needed to address growing public-health problems, disorder and underage drinking  in Northern Ireland.  For those reasons, I decided to introduce, in the first instance, a short Bill  containing new enforcement provisions, which earlier consultations had shown to  have widespread public support.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In September 2008, I submitted a policy memorandum for a  Bill to the Executive for their consideration. On 17 November 2008, I made a statement  to the House announcing my proposals. On 29 January 2009, I received Executive  approval for the Bill. The Bill will form the first stage of a two-stage  approach to reforming the law. I hope that that Bill will be introduced in the  Assembly by this summer and will be in operation by early 2010.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill will introduce three enforcement measures that  will apply to all licensed premises, including off-licences and registered  clubs. First, the Bill will amend the existing law by providing the police with  powers to close registered clubs or licensed premises immediately, for up to 24  hours, because of disorder or noise nuisance. Secondly, the Bill will introduce  a new penalty-points scheme under which points may be endorsed on a licence or  club certificate following convictions for breaches of the law. The new points  system, which will be unique to Northern    Ireland, will target persistent offenders.  It will provide for underage sales to attract mandatory points, which will lead  to the suspension of a licence certificate if the offender accumulates a  certain number of points in a three-year period.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill will introduce a new statutory proof-of-age scheme  which, for the first time, will specify acceptable proof-of-age documents.  Those documents will be a passport, a photo-card driving licence, a Northern Ireland  electoral card and any proof of age standards scheme (PASS) accredited  photo-identity card.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Clubs and licensed premises will be obliged to prominently  display a notice that draws attention to the proof-of-age requirements. The  notice will also make it clear that it is an offence for under 18s to buy  alcohol, for anyone else to buy it for them or for staff to sell it to them.  Furthermore, it will list the penalties for those offences.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">DSD officials have been in touch with trade  representatives, the PSNI, the Northern Ireland Office, the Department of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety and the Northern Ireland Court  Service to ensure that the arrangements for giving effect to the enforcement  proposals in my Bill are practical, acceptable and fit for purpose. Work is  continuing to finalise the detailed drafting, and I am confident that we are on  track to meet my goal of bringing it forward in the summer.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am confident that those measures will support our common  goal of protecting our children and young people from the harm of underage  drinking, however and wherever the alcohol is obtained. When taken in  conjunction with the new test-purchasing powers, which the PSNI hopes to bring  into use in the summer, those measures should be even more effective.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The new enforcement measures that are contained in the Bill  will be steps in the right direction. However, we are all realistic enough to  know that fighting alcohol abuse and its effects is a continuous process. One  principle remains unchanged, however, and that is the importance of striking a  proper balance between combating abuse and respecting valid social and economic  freedoms.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have looked over the key themes and concerns that have emerged  in discussions since the Assembly returned. Those can be grouped and reflected  as strategic propositions. First, there should be a co-ordinated approach to  dealing with alcohol across Departments and across the public, private and  community sectors. Secondly, we must educate people about the dangers and  effects of alcohol. Thirdly, existing laws should be better enforced and  strengthened. Fourthly, alcohol should be more responsibly marketed, more  tightly regulated and made less accessible. Some of those propositions, such as  better co-ordination, education and enforcement appear to be incontrovertibly  good measures.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Everyone would probably favour a co-ordinated approach to  handling alcohol in society. Good education about the effects of alcohol would  help us all, and it would especially help young people to make better-informed  choices and to avoid damage and damage-limitation costs further down the line.  We have already adopted better enforcement of laws to regulate alcohol in  society, and that must surely help.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Other propositions are more problematic, and, as always,  the devil is in the detail. If strengthening our laws, promoting more  responsible marketing or making alcohol less accessible means, in practice,  limiting the rights of the moderate, law-abiding majority to enjoy alcohol and  of respectable traders to trade in it on an equal footing with their  competitors, we will not easily reach consensus. We must, therefore, try to  advance by means of fair compromises and good judgement, and we must certainly  not rush to impose measures in reaction to the latest headlines. We must be  careful.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In every case, we must be able to demonstrate that our  preferred course of action is grounded in robust evidence, is proportionate to  what we perceive to be the problem, is within our legislative competence and  does not fall foul of British or European law, including the European  Convention on Human Rights.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Sometimes, ideas that appear simple and attractive can, on  further investigation, throw up significant challenges to putting them into  effect. Introducing a legal requirement for off-licences to mark containers and  label plastic bags is a classic case in point. On the face of it, that seems to  be a straightforward proposition, yet the difficulties with its introduction  far outweigh any benefits that it might bring. For example, there are issues to  do with EU legislation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As my colleague Mr Maginness pointed out, there are also  issues with regard to evidence in court. Bags that are given out with purchases  from Mr Poots&rsquo;s off licence, for example, could be transferred to an off  licence that is owned by Ms McCann. Therefore, the labelling of plastic bags  throws up certain problems.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have kept a close eye on developments elsewhere that are  relevant to our situation and which have, in some cases, stimulated calls from  Members for similar local action. The Scottish Government are planning to  prevent the sale of alcohol as a loss leader and thereby stop off sales  supplying free and reduced-price alcohol if one or more of that product, or any  other product, is bought. They are also considering raising to 21 the minimum  age for off-sales purchases in their area.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Whitehall  has made action on young people and alcohol a priority and will work more  closely with the alcohol industry to continue to reduce sales to underage  persons. Recently, Ministers there decided to introduce a mandatory code of  practice for the alcohol industry using the Policing and Crime Bill that was  introduced in December 2008. They have also arranged to review the voluntary  agreement whereby the trade must put alcohol health information on cans and  bottles. The findings will help them to decide whether stronger provision in  the form of a legal requirement is needed. Finally, they will study recent  research on alcohol and pricing to help them to decide what further action may  be necessary to make an impact on alcohol-related harm.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We have all followed the recent revelations from the  minimum-pricing debate in Britain,  and I, for one, will continue to watch that space with considerable interest.  The National Assembly for Wales  plans to look at a national proof-of-age scheme and to monitor British  developments on pricing and promotion. In 2008, the Irish Government introduced  stronger legislation to combat underage drinking. The new law provides the  garda&iacute; with powers to carry out test purchasing and to seize alcohol from  persons who are under 18 years of age and in places where they believe public  disorder may occur. It also introduces mixed trading regulations, similar to  those that were introduced in the North in 1997, which require pubs and  nightclubs to have CCTV systems in place.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, ministerial colleagues and I can introduce  measures, not just through licensing legislation, but wherever we judge that  they can be effective to reduce and counter alcohol-related harm, particularly  when it affects young people. I have made a start and the Executive have backed  me and my Bill. I have plans to do more. I will watch and carefully consider  identified good practice; in that context, I aim to meet ministerial colleagues  from Scotland  and elsewhere. I will assess how lessons that have been learnt can be applied  here, if necessary, in a way that is proportionate to our situation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In the end, the debate must extend beyond licensing: there  are huge health issues and policing challenges. Perhaps, most of all, there is  the challenge to change the drinking culture away from the extreme consumption  that is prevalent at present. If we are serious, well-thought-out and joined-up  action is required. I will play my part. I will not, however, bring forward  measures for the sake of scoring political points or in a knee-jerk reaction to  the latest headlines. Abuse of alcohol and its availability to young people is  much too serious a matter for that.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I thank all Members who participated in the debate for their valuable and  knowledgeable contributions. The sale of alcohol to minors is an enormous  problem, and the Minister acknowledged that in her summing-up remarks. In my  winding-up speech, I will deal with the remarks that were made by other Members  and the Minister.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As an elected representative, I face problems that concern  community safety daily. Each day, people come into my office whose homes have  been torn apart by alcohol and, to a lesser extent, drug abuse. Those are real  problems. Every year in the UK,  there are 1&middot;5 million victims of alcohol-fuelled violence. That is a fact. It  is clear that community safety is threatened by the misuse of alcohol. Police  superintendents advise that alcohol is a factor in half of all crime. A Home Office  study found that the growth in beer consumption is the single most important  factor in violent crimes against the person. Research also shows that a high  proportion of victims of violent crime are under the influence of alcohol at  the time of their assault.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">5.45 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In an analysis of data that was drawn from 41 probation  areas between April 2004 and March 2005, the offender assessment system  analysis team found that &mdash; and these are scary facts that no other Member  mentioned &mdash; 37% of offenders currently had a problem with alcohol use, 37% had  a problem with binge drinking, 47% had misused alcohol in the past and 32% used  violent behaviour that is related to their alcohol use. Those are shocking  statistics that paint a clear picture of the need for change, which must begin  with young people learning to drink responsibly at an appropriate age &mdash; 18.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Every Member is concerned that young people, on average,  start to drink at the age of 11. We must address that problem. The problem  begins between the ages of 11 and 16 and impacts on people when they reach an  age at which they must get a job. The statistics show that some people are  drunk as many as 20 times a month. Those are incredible and worrying facts. Northern Ireland has the highest rate of binge  drinking in Europe, which is worrying.  Drinking is related to other problems such as underage pregnancy, sexually  transmitted diseases, theft, vandalism, violence and traffic accidents. We must  address those issues, which affect home life and communities.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In my constituency, I work with community groups and  residents&rsquo; associations that are determined to stamp out abuse in their areas.  Members mentioned offering education programmes for children and providing a  safer option than standing on street corners. Jennifer McCann mentioned  midnight football, which is a good example that will be replicated this year in  Killyleagh and Crossgar in my constituency. Although I do not ignore the  negatives, I always try to focus on taking positive steps. Community groups in  my area are working hard to end the vicious circle of alcoholism and drug  abuse. However, they cannot do so alone, and, therefore, we have brought the  motion to the Chamber today in order to obtain support.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It would be remiss of me not to say a few words in Ulster  Scots. I will restrict it to two sentences.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Strang drink althers personalities an when young fowk ir  onie learnin&rsquo; wha they ir, tae add strang drink tae the mix means at they  wulnae iver hae a richt unnerstannin o&rsquo; wha they ir.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Alcohol changes personalities, and when young people are  learning who they are, adding alcohol to the mix will prevent them from gaining  a good understanding of who they can be. The Chamber made a clear decision on  cigarettes. Although I welcome many of the issues that the Minister raised, it  is important that we do more.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">My colleague Edwin Poots and I discussed the matter and  realised that we both felt strongly about it. There are clear examples of  underage drinking in both our constituencies, and, therefore, we brought the  motion to the Assembly. Mr Poots underlined that prosecutions are non-existent.  The Minister&rsquo;s response indicated that the situation will change, but only time  will tell. As Members know from their constituency work, young people become  aggressive when using alcohol. The Chamber needs to send a clear message today  to those people who have the power to make changes, namely those who sell the  drink in off-licences to parents and family members. Many issues need to be  addressed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">About half a dozen Members referred to the age of 11 as the  time when some young people start drinking. I think Basil McCrea mentioned  that, at an event for young people, they were asked at what age they should be  able to drink alcohol, and when the answer of 12 was given, they all cheered.  That should tell us something about our society. It makes the issues clear for  each of us.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Jennifer McCann, who is no longer present, referred to the  midnight football scheme that has been successful in west Belfast, and will be successful elsewhere &mdash; a  scheme is being established in Newtownards. It takes people away from  temptation and puts their focus and energy into football &mdash; that is important.  She also mentioned the need to control drink promotions. I think the point she  was making is that cheap drink leads to more drunks, which is a symptom of a  wider problem.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Billy Armstrong &mdash; in between fighting with his mobile phone  &mdash; managed to express some points of view about the problems of promiscuity  among young people, particularly young girls. That is a UK epidemic.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Carmel Hanna always makes a valuable contribution to  debates, especially those on health or social issues. She referred to the  problem as a time bomb ticking away and said that the Province, and the whole  of the UK,  is &ldquo;drowning in drink&rdquo;. The facts and figures outline for many of us what we  are trying to deliver. She also said that the solution is education in schools  and colleges. The police, too, have a role to play, as do parents.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Anna Lo also referred to alcohol abuse destroying lives.  She mentioned the issue of test purchasing, about which we have had a positive  response from the Minister. David Hilditch, the Chairperson of the Committee,  also mentioned the Committee&rsquo;s recomm&shy;endations in relation to proof of age and  test purchasing. He was concerned too about proxy purchasing. Furthermore,  there is something wrong with a society in which the price of drink is lower  than the price of bottled water.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Raymond McCartney made some very positive comments and  provided some ideas on how to address the problem. He referred to the civic  alcohol forum in Londonderry, as well as the  hotline, and the issue of taxis. I ask the Minister to take those issues on  board, because they are positive ways in which we can do something.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Lord Morrow said that it was regrettable that the matter  must be brought to the House, and he is right. He also said that the blame lies  with the parents, which I think is correct. Parents have a responsibility.  Members of Ards DPP went on patrol with the police, as my colleague Michelle  McIlveen mentioned. It was obvious that some of the kids were actually getting  drink from their parents. I find that disconcerting.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Basil McCrea mentioned that they had changed the opinion of  20 people. That was good news &mdash; we must get him on the promotion trail.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Thank goodness for Edwin Poots, who brought Alban Maginness  back to the issue, and provided focus again. Jonathan Craig mentioned the issue  of people starting young and ending up with drink problems in years to come.  Michelle McIlveen referred to the need for a framework across all Departments.  The Minister also mentioned that in her response.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Minister for her comments and her positive  attitude. We hope that people will be educated about alcohol, that there will  be cross-departmental approval for any measures put in place, that the existing  laws will be enforced and that alcohol will be promoted more appropriately. I  urge the Minister to support the &ldquo;blue bag&rdquo; legislation and the moves to raise  the legal age for buying alcohol to 21 and to take on board the ideas from Scotland, Wales  and the Republic   of Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We have made a start; we have got a response. However, we  look for more, because more is needed. I thank every Member who spoke in the  debate and the Minister for her contribution.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText"><em>Question put and agreed to.</em></p>
      <p class="B3BodyText"><em>Resolved:</em></p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly calls on  the Minister for Social Development to introduce a series of measures on  off-licence sales of alcohol to reduce its availability to minors.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Motion made:</p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">That the Assembly do now  adjourn. &mdash; <em>[Mr Deputy Speaker.]</em></p>
      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="7"></a>adjournment</p>
      <p class="H4StageHeading">Urban Renewal Status for &nbsp;Upper Long Streets in North   Belfast</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The proposer of the topic will have 15 minutes in which to speak.  All other Members who wish to speak will have approximately 10 minutes.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Beidh m&eacute; ag labhairt ar son na  d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireachta.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Business Committee for its support in selecting  this Adjournment topic, which is very topical &mdash; pardon the pun.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As was mentioned yesterday at Question Time, during  questions to the Minister for Social Development, the residents of the upper  long streets have been campaigning since 2002 for full redevelopment of that  area. Those residents have consistently raised the need for full redevelopment  of their area.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">During Question Time yesterday, the Minister raised the  issue of what has become known as blighted areas. For Members who do not know,  such areas can include locations affected by dereliction, some of which can be  attributed to absentee landlords or to a general running-down in appearance,  which results in the environmental neglect of a whole area.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is to the residents&rsquo; credit that they have persisted in  maintaining their homes to the best of their ability in spite of everything and  have consistently fought for full regeneration for that part of the New Lodge Road.  Anyone walking through the area can only be struck by the number of homes that have  been steeled up and remain derelict.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Many representations were made to direct rule Ministers and  to the Housing Executive. Indeed, there is quite some interest in the  regeneration of the upper long streets, and North Belfast  in general, from human rights and equality activists. There is huge concern  about what the Minister said yesterday. She told the House:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Housing Executive is now working on new proposals  for a major refurbishment project that would update and refresh those homes in  greatest need, with demolition only for those homes that are beyond repair.&rdquo; &mdash; <span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official Report, Vol 39,  No 6, p296, col 1].</span></p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That has caused a lot of alarm. Today&rsquo;s Adjournment  debate, therefore, has come at a very good time.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The Minister also said:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;78% of residents think that their accommodation is  suitable for their needs.&rdquo;<span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; "> &mdash; [Official Report, Vol 39, No 6, p296, col 1].</span></span></p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I contest that. There have been many appraisals,  evaluations and reports on the issue. Today, many residents are asking how a  previously refurbished home can be refurbished again. That is just one example  of what we feel is going to be a cosmetic exercise. In the case of the upper  long streets, we are not talking about cracks; we are talking about chasms. The  houses are in a really bad state of repair, and many people believe that they  are unfit and beyond further refurbishment.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Previous economic appraisals have advocated proposals for  full redevelopment. Therefore, the question that needs to be answered today is  whether the residents of the upper long streets who are living in poor  conditions are now going to have to accept second-class services and facilities  from the Department for Social Development. Do they not, and can they not,  expect to enjoy the same facilities and the same state of repair of their homes  as, for example, people in Downpatrick?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The houses that we are talking about today are  approximately 130 years old and were refurbished in the 1970s and 1980s. Those  works were undertaken then with the expectation that the houses would not last  for more than 20 years: we are well beyond that point now.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has yet to meet the democratically elected  residents&rsquo; committee. The committee holds regular meetings with the Housing  Executive and other statutory bodies, and, in conjunction with the community  empowerment project in the area, has audited all the residents of the upper  long streets on the matter on at least one occasion. Many houses in the area  remain derelict, and in light of the Minister&rsquo;s comments yesterday, there is  now real concern about future plans and for the residents&rsquo; proposals.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I appeal to the Minister and to all the North Belfast MLAs to  listen to the concerns that have been expressed. I thank Fred Cobain and Alban  Maginness for being here. I ask that we set aside our political differences,  because we need to step up to the mark and stand beside the residents in this  case. Today, we are talking about the upper long streets, but tomorrow, Fred  could be talking about Tigers Bay,   Victoria, Parkside and the Glen.  I suspect that we will be here again shortly.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister said that she did not want anyone to be  without a home in an area of high social need, and neither do I. However, we  cannot stand by and condemn the residents to houses that, according to the  Minister, only deserve another refurbishment. That is not acceptable.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">6.00 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We have heard concerns, comments and speculation about the  architectural integrity of those old houses and about the need for them to be  preserved. On the one hand, those concerns are valid. On the other hand &mdash; and  with the greatest respect to the Environment Agency &mdash; the real concern is that  those homes are not fit for habitation and cannot withstand, or endure, another  refurbishment. Architectural concerns should never have primacy over the people  who live in those houses and their quality of life.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister knows full well &mdash; she is well acquainted with  this issue &mdash; that the waiting list for houses in North   Belfast is one of the worst in the North. We have the unfortunate  situation whereby, in some instances, three generations of the one family are  now living under one roof. That is not Sinn F&eacute;in rhetoric; that is a reality,  and it is one that is resulting in a poor quality of life for many people.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The proposals to redevelop the upper long streets are and  will continue to be an equality issue. Those residents deserve better than  this. They deserve to have the issue resolved. The speculation over what the  latest proposals will contain needs to end. I view this situation as an issue  of social justice. I appeal to the Minister to meet the elected residents&rsquo;  committee for the upper long streets to discuss how the issue will be taken  forward. I urge the other Members for North Belfast  to support that residents committee and the other residents&rsquo; committees that  will no doubt face the same uncertainty about regeneration in their own areas.  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cobain</strong>: I  thank the Member for raising this issue in the Assembly today. Although we are  discussing the long streets, we could be discussing Tigers  Bay, Parkside or anywhere in North Belfast. The issue for us is that all those areas  need redevelopment, and they need it quickly. I want to raise three issues &mdash;  and I emphasise to the Minister that I am speaking only on behalf of the people  whom I represent in North Belfast.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">First, the issue of refurbishment &mdash; which I have heard  mentioned on three or four occasions over the past number of months &mdash; is, as  far as I am concerned, a non-runner. People in these areas suffered through  refurbishments in the 1970s and 1980s. Those houses are as a bad today as they  were in the 1970s and 1980s. We are not going to support any more  refurbishments, because those houses need to be redeveloped.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The people who live in those homes need houses for the  twenty-first century. Whether it be the long streets or anywhere else in North Belfast, that is what is needed. We will not accept  anything less than twenty-first-century homes for the people who live in those  areas. The Minister needs to take on board the fact that we will not support  refurbishment.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have listened to the arguments made for refurbish&shy;ment.  It is argued that if homes are refurbished, there will still be the same number  of homes as there were, and that because of the waiting lists, it is important  to retain the number of homes. That is not the issue. The issue is that some of  those homes are not fit for habitation, and irrespective of how much money is  spent on them they still will not be fit for the twenty-first century.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In some cases, two houses have been knocked into one;  carbuncles have built onto the back of houses; rooms are the wrong shape; or  houses are full of damp. Irrespective of how much money is spent on them, those  homes are still 100 or 150 years old. It could end up that more money is spent  on refurbishment than on renewal. I make it clear to the Minister that there is  no possibility of our accepting the refurbishment of homes.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Car&aacute;l spoke about the environmental architects. Some of  those people should go and live in these areas and see what the tenants have to  put up with. I agree that we need to retain environmental heritage, but some  people get carried away with that idea. Those people should come and live in  those houses every day of the week to see the circumstances under which the tenants  live.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">My second point is that the people who live in those areas  have been betrayed by the Executive. The Minister corrected me yesterday when I  said that we need between 2,000 and 2,500 new homes every year &mdash; she quite  rightly said that we need 3,000. We are committed to building 1,500 new social  and affordable homes. I emphasise that those houses must be social and  affordable &mdash; not just social. Affordable homes are for people who can afford a  mortgage; the social homes will also have to come out of the 1,500 new homes,  and they are for the people whom I am concerned about &mdash; the people who are  relying on the state to provide a home.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We will get 1,500 new homes, which is half the number that  we need. We are in an economic downturn, which will increase the housing  pressures through repossessions. The 1,500 new homes are half of what we need  now, but, two years from now, they might be a third of what we need. Pressures  are growing in respect of people who are dependent on the Executive to provide  proper homes for them and their families. Those people do not have anywhere to  go &mdash; they cannot get mortgages because they do not have the sufficient  resources. Due to the tightening of resources in the mortgage market, it is  less likely that those people will be able to get mortgages in future, so we  need to provide additional homes for them. The building of 1,500 new homes when  3,000 are required will ensure that the housing pressures grow. The Executive  have let down and betrayed the people who depend on us for proper homes.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister said that we are going to get 1,750 new homes,  but the cost will be borne by people who need new kitchens, new windows and new  disability adaptations to their homes. There are people with disabilities who  have to wash in hand basins because they cannot get into their baths, and we do  not have the sufficient resources to give them dignity. Those people need  urgent help even to maintain basic hygiene, and we do not have the money. That  is how low we have sunk in the provision of proper resources for working-class  people and families on benefits.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have listened to the debates on housing here, and I have  heard Democratic Unionist Party Members telling other Members to provide an  alternative. The Minister of Finance and Personnel came to the House three or  four weeks ago and re-prioritised the Budget through the strategic stocktake.  He took money away from Departments and allocated it to others without the  approval of the House. Mr Durkan raised the issue of properly debating Budgets  in the House, but that was pooh-poohed by the two largest parties. That is what  is happening: people are prioritising how we spend our money without the  approval of the House, and the poor in this city and across Northern Ireland,  who depend on us, are not getting what they deserve &mdash; they never did, and they  are not getting it now.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I support what the Member for North Belfast Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n  said. I support the provision of sufficient housing for those who need it. I  support redevelopment and not refurbishment. I support the provision of proper  facilities and help for people with disabilities so that they can have basic  dignity. I support the right of people who live in those homes to have a proper  kitchen &mdash; some kitchens are 30 or 35 years old, and the doors are damaged and  cannot be reattached to their frames. Those are the sorts of conditions in  which people are living in the twenty-first century.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I support anything that we can do to ensure that a proper  focus is placed on this issue. I will speak for myself, and other Members can  speak for themselves, but I am not going to sit by any longer and allow people  who are socially and economically deprived &mdash; the poor in our society &mdash; to be  marginalised even more. Those days are over for me.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that all the Members who come to the House and talk  the grand talk will walk the walk when it comes to supporting issues of social  justice and that they are not just cannon fodder for the Executive.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am happy to support Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n, a Member for North  Belfast, and I hope that the Members she referred to who support areas where  people are deprived &mdash; and there are many such areas &mdash; will also be on their  feet to ensure that proper resources are spent on these people.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I am surprised that so few Members from North Belfast  are here today, given that this is an issue of extraordinary importance. It is  a timely Adjournment debate on an issue that has vexed the people who have  lived in the upper long streets for many years. It is frustrating for people to  live in certain conditions and in an area where there is a clear housing need  that is not being addressed properly.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I support Mr Cobain&rsquo;s commitment to social justice being a  way to alleviate the housing problem in North Belfast,  particularly in the upper long streets area. There are 2,400 people on the  waiting list, and 1,401 people are in housing stress in North   Belfast. We have, particularly in the Catholic community in North  Belfast, a shortage of building land that could &mdash; or would &mdash; accommodate those  people who need to be rehoused. In North Belfast,  80% of people on the housing list are from the Catholic community.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A substantial amount of land is available in the shape of  Girdwood Barracks. That land could be used for housing development. I hope that  that project will come on stream soon so that the housing problem can be  alleviated through newbuild, particularly &mdash; but not exclusively &mdash; for those in  the Catholic community. It is important that those who are in need are accommodated  fully.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As regards the upper long streets, I and others have  supported the campaign for redevelopment that residents in that area have been  engaged in. There have been long arguments with the Housing Executive over that  particular problem. Redevelopment in the upper long streets must be the  objective of the Department for Social Development. The area has been  effectively blighted for a long time, and people deserve proper and decent  homes. That should be our objective, and I am confident that the Minister for  Social Development shares that view.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that Members, particularly those who represent North  Belfast, will support the Minister for Social Development in getting the proper  funding that is necessary to deal with the housing problem, not just in North  Belfast, but across Northern    Ireland. People in various other  constituencies also have an immense problem. It is therefore quite clear that  there is a serious and critical problem with funding for housing.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There will be a shortfall of &pound;100 million for social  housing in this financial year.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I will give way in just a moment.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">How will we deal with that situation? I hope that the  Minister of Finance and Personnel will tell us that the problems that the  Minister for Social Development has presented to the House on the housing  shortfall will be remedied. It is particularly important that he represents North Belfast.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">6.15 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way. First, I apologise on behalf of my colleague  Gerry Kelly for his absence; he is in Europe.  The Member is aware that Fra McCann, Mickey Brady and I supported his proposal  to the Committee for Social Development arguing for more money for the  Minister&rsquo;s housing budget.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is disappointing that there are no Members here from the  unionist community other than Fred Cobain, and I thank him for his  contribution. However, we will argue for, and support, the call for more money  for housing. There is absolutely no difficulty with that, but we must also  accept that a lot of money from the Department for Social Development was  surrendered, and that is the circle that must be squared.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  There have been interminable arguments about the surrender of money, and so  forth. Without going over well-trammelled or well-tramped territory, all I  would say to the Member is that whether or not money has been surrendered is  immaterial.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  No, the Member has made her point and has made it on previous occasions.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is a shortfall, which affects people not only in the  long streets but in other parts of North Belfast, other parts of the city and  across Northern Ireland.  As public representatives, we must put pressure on the Department of Finance  and Personnel to come up with the necessary funding. It is not only a matter of  social justice &mdash; as Mr Cobain quite properly said &mdash; but a matter that will be  of great assistance to the community and local economy in spending ourselves  out of the recession.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Deputy Speaker knows, and I know, how badly affected the  construction industry has been, and this is one way for Government to intervene  directly in the economy. Private developers will not build houses because there  is no profit in it for them and many of them are almost bankrupt. In any event,  they cannot get the necessary cash from the banks in order to start building</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">However, the Government have an opportunity to plough money  into the construction industry, and the best way to do that is through social  housing. Mr Cobain is right in stating that we need 3,000 houses a year. Given  the resources that the Minister has, she is attempting to build 1,500 or 1,700  houses a year, which is, quite clearly, inadequate. Nonetheless, given the  funding that she hoped to have, it is the only way to respond to housing  problems.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cobain</strong>:  The point that Members must continue to make is that, before the economic  downturn, the Executive set a target of 1,500 houses. Those people who rely on  the state &mdash; those who are deprived or &ldquo;poor&rdquo;, as we call them &mdash; were never  going to get a fair deal out of that. Even before the economic downturn, 1,500  houses were all that the Executive were prepared to build. Alban &mdash; and all of  us &mdash; accept that that number was totally inadequate for the job that must be  done in providing social housing.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I must conclude fairly soon. When devolution was restored, we all said that we  wanted to make a difference, and I am quite certain that my colleagues in the  Chamber want to make a difference. I am also sure that the Minister wants to  make a difference by improving housing in this society. However, in order to do  that we need the proper funding, which not only solves the problem of social  justice and of people in the long streets but helps to solve our economic  problems. I believe that the motion is timely and that redevelopment is the  best way forward.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I am confident that the Minister shares that  perspective. I hope that there will be fresh proposals on the long streets soon  and that the Housing Executive will firmly commit to their earliest possible  implementation.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development (Ms Ritchie)</strong>: I thank the Members who contributed to the  debate: Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n, Fred Cobain and Alban Maginness. I welcome the  opportunity to take part in the debate and to respond to each of the  contributions, not least because it gives me the opportunity to clarify and  correct some of the points that were raised this afternoon. I will try to  address all the questions and points that Members raised. However, I assure  them that I will study the Hansard report, and, if I have left any unanswered,  I will write directly to the Member concerned.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As the Members, as they represent North   Belfast, know, the upper long streets is part of the upper New  Lodge and approximately 1&middot;25 miles from the city centre. The area contains 211  homes, of which half are in private ownership and one quarter of those  privately rented. North Belfast is already  recognised as an area of acute housing need, with more than 4,200 people  waiting for a home, and, of those, 1,401 are in housing stress. Over the years,  the lack of available land to develop for social housing has simply exacerbated  the problem, and the number of people in housing stress illustrates how acute  the need is in the area.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Housing Executive has already invested significantly in  the area through a programme of improvements to public stock and the promotion  of grants for privately owned homes. If examined in the context of other parts  of Northern Ireland, North Belfast has received a large share of the overall  housing investment programme for some years. However, given the age and condition  of many of the houses in the area, further redevelopment work was always going  to be necessary.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In recent years, a range of options has been considered for  the long streets, each with its own pros and cons. I share the frustration of  those who say that the process has taken too long to reach this point; I agree  entirely that it has taken far too long. I have made Upper New Lodge a priority  with regard to bringing forward proposals to start that redevelopment. I  visited the area several times at the invitation of Mr Maginness. I met some of  the residents, and I saw at first hand the condition and size of the houses.  Although many homes have been very well maintained, over time many have not.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Although my Department first received specific proposals for  the redevelopment work back in September 2006, those underwent various  assessments until November of last year. Even allowing for the difficult issues  under consideration, such a timetable is simply not satisfactory.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The new proposals included plans to demolish 178 homes,  many of which are privately owned. Given that more than half of the homes in  the area are privately owned, and very few of those are empty, I must take into  account the area&rsquo;s apparent degree of confidence in the future. I do not want to  destroy that community stability. Interestingly, however, a survey found that  almost 80% of residents considered their accommodation suitable for their  needs. That has made it even more difficult for me to accept such a large-scale  demolition of houses. Although the houses are old and need substantial  refurbishment, they remain perfectly habitable, and are, for the most part,  meeting the needs of those who live in them.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">However, I listened carefully to Members today. The  demolition of those 178 homes was to be offset by the construction of 98 new  units of accommodation, because put back is always much less than what was  originally there.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That would mean a net loss of 80 homes in an area of great  housing need, where a large number of people are on the waiting list or in  housing stress. However, it would still have meant that many families would  have little choice but to move away from the area. In that respect, people have  told me that demolition would mean breaking up the community.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I listened to what Alban Maginness and Mr Cobain said about  housing need in North Belfast. That need has  been clearly identified by the Housing Executive &mdash; 3,000 houses are needed each  year for all of Northern    Ireland. We propose to build 50% of those  houses, but resources remain an issue.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I was glad to hear Members say that there is a need for  resources to be invested in the community, but the issue for me is the need to  reprofile the housing budget and to put the social housing development  programme as the Executive&rsquo;s number-one priority. That will act as a stimulus  for the local economy, it will put people back into work, it will sustain  existing jobs, and it will ensure that we have a valuable asset &mdash; the most  valuable asset that anyone wants is a roof over their heads. It will also  ensure that valuable proposals for redevelopment, such as the long streets, can  be carried out. However, I need the Executive&rsquo;s support and understanding. I  have tried to persuade my Executive colleagues of that, and an independent  person is carrying out a piece of work on that issue.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is an acute housing shortage in North   Belfast, and Members will want to reflect on that. However, do we  want to provide better housing, and do we want to do that by providing  substantially less housing? I will park those questions with Members.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is no nearby or overspill housing that could be  offered to those families; they would have no option but to move out of the  area.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to touch on an issue that affects Members. We have  already addressed the issue of resources, and I look forward to getting support  for that, but I want to touch on an issue that deals specifically with North Belfast. Part of the solution to the housing  shortage in lower North Belfast will come  about if the represent&shy;atives from the two main parties show political leadership.  Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP need to get out from behind their tribal wagons and show  a way forward.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I understand the problems with the long streets &mdash; I have  seen them at first hand. However, there is the issue of housing on the  extensive Girdwood Barracks site, which is not far from there, and it will be  looming large soon. All the political parties need to step up to the plate on  the issue and get their people out of the sectarian trenches. That is how they  can show that they care about the provision of housing in lower North Belfast.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I assure Members that I remain totally committed to  delivering the work needed to redevelop the upper long streets, but I will not  approve wholesale demolition simply because it may be the easiest option. I  have asked the Housing Executive to bring forward plans that will allow for  those homes to be properly restored and renovated, while using demolition as an  option primarily for dwellings that cannot readily be brought back into use. I  have asked for those plans to be resubmitted before the end of April, and I  want to announce the way forward shortly afterwards. In fact, I have been told  that those proposals will be with me next week.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Some of the many residents of the long streets are sitting  in the Public Gallery, and others who cannot be with us today because of  infirmity deserve some clarity about future plans. As I have shown in the  Village in South Belfast and elsewhere, when I  have an acceptable solution, I am prepared to move quickly on it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to emphasise that I do not want to prejudge what the  Housing Executive&rsquo;s revised proposals will look like.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cobain</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I have only a few minutes left.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I anticipate several phases of work, with substantial  demolition in the early phases. Therefore, I am not simply replacing demolition  with refurbishment &mdash; I am pushing for the best all-round solution.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I repeat that I do not wish to prejudge what the Housing  Executive will do, but I anticipate several phases of work with substantial  demolition in the early phases.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">6.30 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Again, I thank all the Members who participated in the  debate. I thank C&aacute;ral for securing the adjournment debate and for raising a question  on the issue yesterday during Question Time. I also thank Fred and Alban for  their contributions. All Members who have contributed have done so in a  positive manner.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I assure Members that I, the Department and the Housing  Executive will continue to work closely and quickly with the local community.  Residents will be updated on our future plans for the redevelopment of their  community and the redevelopment of the communities that are represented by the  other Members present. Residents deserve clarity on this issue, but there are  many other issues that deal with the wider housing debate and the wider  resource issue.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">C&aacute;ral raised a point about surrender earlier, and I can  clarify that that money was not surrendered. Instead, I requested a  reallocation to deal with the pressure in the housing budget &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Minister&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I re-emphasise the need for the wider Executive to  accept that there must be an investment in the overall social-housing development  programme.</p>
