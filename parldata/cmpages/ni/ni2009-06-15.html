    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The Assembly met at 12 noon (Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr  McClarty] in the Chair).</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="1"></a>Matters Of The Day</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Kilkeel Plane Crash</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Ms Margaret Ritchie has sought leave to make a statement on a  matter that fulfils the criteria that are set out in Standing Order 24. I will  call Ms Ritchie to speak for up to three minutes on the subject. I will then  call other Members from South Down, who will also have three minutes to speak.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  On Friday last at 9.00 pm, a tragic air traffic accident took place near the Ballyardle Road,  Kilkeel, in which Hugh McKnight, Andrew Burden and Stephen Annett lost their  lives. My sympathy goes out to the families and friends of the deceased, and  there is no doubt that the support and solidarity of the communities of  Annalong, Ballymartin and Kilkeel are with them. I am very conscious of the  anguish and trauma of the bereaved.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">An investigation into the accident is ongoing. That  investigation needs to examine the safety of light aircraft and, in particular,  the special landscape and topographical features of the part of south Down in  which the accident occurred. Not only was the crash a tragedy but it is a sign  of a more worrying situation, for it is the second air accident in Kilkeel in  three weeks. Moreover, not so long ago, a similar incident occurred in  Cookstown, which thankfully and fortunately did not result in any fatalities. I  am also mindful of other air traffic accidents, particularly the Air France  disaster in which a young doctor from Ballygowan lost her life.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will write to the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State  for Transport, Paul Clark, about the safety of light aircraft. I am doing that  because air safety is a reserved matter, and thorough investigation is  required. I hope that the current investigation is speedy and effective and  makes recommendations that ensure that such incidents are eliminated.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important for the House to demonstrate solidarity  with and support for the bereaved and to convey sympathy to those who are  suffering at this difficult time.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>: I  thank the Member for South Down Ms Ritchie for tabling this matter, because it  is important for the House to extend its condolences to the families of Andrew  Burden, Stephen Annett and Hugh McKnight, who died as a result of Friday&rsquo;s  tragedy. All had a love of sport and were coming back from the TT races on the Isle of Man when the incident occurred. Hugh had been  ferrying people back and forth to that event all week, which was a generous  gesture that, sadly, ended in tragedy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is one of a series of tragedies to have afflicted the  South Down constituency in recent months. However, I know that the people of  Mourne will rally around and give tremendous support to the families of the  bereaved and that everyone will do whatever they can to help the families in  these difficult circumstances.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A fitting tribute to those who died would be, as Ms Ritchie  said, for something to be done to improve safety for light aircraft throughout Northern Ireland  but particularly in Mourne. There was a serious accident only a few days before  the latest event, and it was fortunate that there were no injuries, or worse,  on that occasion. It would be welcome if, as a result of Friday night&rsquo;s  incident, something is done to help those who fly light aircraft in and out of  small airstrips in south Down to do so safely.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This has been an awful event for all concerned, and I know  that all Members will join me in passing our sympathies to the families.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I, too, extend my condolences to  the families. This is a further tragedy to hit the Mournes following the loss  of the four PSNI officers at Warrenpoint and the tragic fishing disaster that  affected the Greene family.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I knew Hugh McKnight from his days in the RUC, and,  although we did not see eye to eye on many occasions, he was always human and  compassionate in how he dealt with members of the public. This is a sad loss to  the whole Mourne and south Down area but particularly to the victims&rsquo; families.  It must also be unbearable for everyone whose lives the three men touched.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I concur with what the other Members said about examining  light aircraft safety, particularly at landing strips, which seem to be popping  up regularly. That issue needs closer examination by the planning authorities  and greater scrutiny by the regulators.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I convey Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s sympathy to all the families.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I thank the Member for South Down Ms Ritchie for tabling this matter. I extend,  on behalf of the Ulster Unionist Party, our deepest and most sincere sympathies  to the McKnight, Burden and Annett families.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At times such as these, when such a tragedy occurs, we rise  to the challenge as one community and stand shoulder to shoulder with families  who have suffered. It is so sad that three men&rsquo;s participation in something  that they loved &mdash; watching road racing at the TT on the Isle   of Man and flying light aircraft, for which Mr McKnight had a  passion &mdash; should end in tragedy. It reminds us all of how quickly events can  turn to tragedy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I think and hope that every Member and everyone across  south Down and Northern    Ireland will keep the families in their  thoughts and prayers. We should do that at this difficult time and, indeed, in  the weeks and months ahead, as the full extent of the loss sinks in for those  families.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  Just over six months ago, on 24 November 2008, the six South Down Assembly  Members expressed condolences to the families of four young policemen and a  young social worker who had died the previous weekend. Sadly, today, we express  solidarity with the families of the pilot, Hugh McKnight, Andrew Burden and his  young colleague, Stephen Annett.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Minister Ritchie mentioned, County Down  has suffered great tragedy. We heard about the fishing tragedies, and it is  appropriate that we also think of the family of Dr Eithne Walls, who died in  the Air France tragedy. I offer my sympathy and the sympathy of the people whom  I represent to the families. It is difficult to comprehend the grief that they  are experiencing at this time.</p>
    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="2"></a>Assembly Business</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">New Assembly Member: Mr Danny Kinahan</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:  The Speaker has been informed by the Chief Electoral Officer that Mr Danny  Kinahan has been returned as a Member of the Assembly for the South   Antrim constituency to fill the vacancy that resulted from the  resignation of Mr David Burnside. Mr Kinahan signed the Roll of Membership and  entered his designation in the presence of the Speaker and the Clerk to the  Assembly/Director General in the Speaker&rsquo;s Office on Tuesday 9 June 2009. Mr  Kinahan has now taken his seat.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker. I also thank my predecessor, David  Burnside, for his many years of hard work in South Antrim.  I look forward to working to the best of my ability for everyone in South Antrim.</p>
    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="3"></a>Executive Committee Business</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Suspension of Standing Orders</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Speaker has been advised that the Minister of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment will move all the items of business that stand on today&rsquo;s  Order Paper in the name of the Minister of Finance and Personnel on his behalf.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment (Mrs Foster)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That Standing Orders 10(2) to 10(4) be suspended for  15 June 2009.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Before I put the question, I remind Members that this motion  requires cross-community support.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic"><strong>Resolved (with  cross-community support)</strong>:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That Standing Orders 10(2) to 10(4) be suspended for  15 June 2009.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: As the motion has been agreed, today&rsquo;s sitting may go beyond 7.00  pm, if required.</p>
    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="4"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Swine Flu</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I have received notice from the Minister of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety that he wishes to make a statement on the outbreak  of swine flu.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: I take this  opportunity to provide Members with a further update on the Northern Ireland  response to the swine flu virus. On Thursday 11 June, the World Health  Organization announced that it considered the swine flu virus to have reached  global pandemic levels. That announcement means that we have moved to phase 6  of our pandemic flu preparations. I reassure Members, as I did following the  announcement, that the declaration does not reflect the severity of the virus;  it means that the World Health Organization thinks that the virus has spread  more widely around the world and now fulfils the definition of a pandemic.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Scottish Government confirmed yesterday that a patient  with underlying health problems had died after testing positive for the H1N1  virus. She is the first person in Europe to  die from the virus, and she had other, underlying health problems. Her death  does not mean that the virus is becoming more severe. Indeed, the evidence to  date suggests that the virus is not changing at all.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There have been confirmed cases of the virus in 74 countries  and large increases in the number of confirmed cases being reported in the UK, Australia,  Chile and Japan.  Globally, there have been 30,128 confirmed cases and 165 deaths. Throughout the  UK, there are 1,277  confirmed cases, eight of which are in Northern Ireland. We have also seen  more cases of the virus in the Republic   of Ireland, with 12 cases  now confirmed. Given the increasing number of cases worldwide, we can expect  more cases here.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The World Health Organization considers the pandemic to be  moderate, with the majority of people affected by the virus recovering well,  without the need for hospitalisation or medical care. Our experience in the UK has been  that the levels of clinically severe or fatal cases appear to be similar to  that of seasonal flu. In the majority of cases, the disease has generally been  mild, but it is proving to be severe in a small minority of cases. I am pleased  to report that all the people in Northern Ireland who contracted the  virus have fully recovered or are recovering well.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that Members be aware that the World Health  Organization&rsquo;s move to phase 6 does not change the UK&rsquo;s overall assessment of the  virus and does not trigger any material change in our public health response.  The World Health Organization, in determining its pandemic alert phases, needs  to consider what is happening globally, and, as I reported, although the number  of cases throughout the world continues to rise, there continues to be only a  small number of cases in Northern    Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As in the rest of the UK, we have been planning for a  potential pandemic for some time, and, since the emergence of swine flu, we  have been operating at a heightened state of readiness. Our plans are robust  and well rehearsed. We are continuing with our preparations based on prudent  planning assumptions, because it is still too early to predict accurately the  impact of the pandemic on the UK.  The move to phase 6 vindicates our planning for a pandemic and the possibility  of large numbers of people catching swine flu. I understand how the further  development in Scotland may  cause public concern, but the UK  is one of the best-prepared countries in the world, so we are well equipped to  deal with the pandemic. In line with the World Health Organization&rsquo;s advice,  the UK Government will not impose any domestic or international travel  restrictions, and they will keep UK borders open.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In Northern Ireland,  as in the rest of the UK,  we are following a containment strategy, supplying antivirals to people who  develop the disease and, as a preventative measure, to their close contacts.  The strategy has been effective to date in delaying widespread transmission.  However, it will not work indefinitely if there is a rapid rise in cases.  Therefore, preparations are in hand to move to a mitigation strategy. Such a  strategy will mean that, when the number of cases increases beyond a certain  level, we will have to keep under review the extent to which we supply antivirals  to contacts. In the first instance, we will supply them only to immediate, close  contacts rather than to all contacts. The mitigation strategy may also require  the use of clinical diagnosis rather than laboratory testing where there is a  high probability that people will test positive for the virus. A reduction in  the numbers of follow-up contacts may also be necessary so that we target only  people who are most at risk.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The move to phase 6 means that vaccine manufacturers will  need to meet the contractual obligations of advance purchase agreements for  vaccines that were made with the UK and some other countries. Such  agreements were made in the event of a pandemic being declared and enable the  UK to purchase up to 132 million doses of pandemic-specific vaccine when it  becomes available, which means that we will have access to two doses of  pandemic-specific vaccine for everyone in Northern Ireland if needed. Northern Ireland  has a stock of antiviral drugs that covers half the population, and I have  ensured that steps are in place to increase that stock so that antiviral drugs  will be available to treat up to 80% of the population.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Last Friday, I called a meeting of the chief executives of  the various health and social care bodies and the Fire and Rescue Service to  assure myself that their organisations are in an advanced state of preparedness  and ready to respond to the increased number of cases expected in the near  future. The meeting was positive, and I am pleased that extensive plans are in  place to ensure that the population will be protected.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also continue to meet my counterparts throughout the UK. Along with  Health Ministers from Wales  and Scotland,  I take part in regular COBRA meetings that are now chaired by the new Secretary  of State for Health, Andy Burnham. My Department continues to work closely with  the Department of Health and Children in the Republic of Ireland  on North/South preparedness. Last week, on the fringes of the North/South  Ministerial Council meeting, I met Mary Harney to discuss swine flu  preparations and planning.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As we have been doing to date, my Department and I will  ensure that the public are kept fully informed and are given the necessary  advice. I remind Members and the public that we cannot do this alone: everyone must continue to play  their part in helping to reduce the impact of the pandemic. My key message to  everyone is to carry on as normal but to ensure that they follow the public  health advice that has been widely publicised in leaflets, on television and  radio, and in newspapers. The simple but effective measures that the public can  take to protect themselves include covering their noses and mouths when  coughing or sneezing, putting tissues in the bin and washing their hands with  soap and water or sanitising gel as soon as possible. The message is simple:  &lsquo;Catch it, Bin it, Kill it.&rsquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Public Health Agency will continue to carry out  rigorous surveillance to identify cases and arrange antiviral treatment for  those affected and their close contacts. My Department is monitoring the  situation in Northern    Ireland and will take the necessary action  to respond to the emerging situation. My officials are working closely with  those from other Departments, particularly OFMDFM, as necessary to ensure that  the wider Northern Ireland  response is appropriate. I will, of course, report again to the Assembly as the  situation evolves.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mrs I Robinson)</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s swift and measured response to the pandemic. He said  that steps are in place to increase the amount of antiviral drugs to cover 80%  of the population. How long will it take to achieve that benchmark of 80%  availability? Will there be enough antiviral drugs for the autumn, when a major  rise in the number of people presenting with this type of flu is expected?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I assume that when the Minister mentioned people who are  most at risk he was referring to older people, particularly those diagnosed  with clostridium difficile and MRSA. Given that their condition is considerably  weakened, will they be given priority?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I have dealt with the matter of  antiviral drugs in the House on a number of occasions. Stocks are in place to  cover 50% of the population; no pandemic has yet affected over 30% of a  population. However, I have placed an order that will increase the population  coverage to 80%. I have no precise date for the arrival of those antiviral  drugs, but they will certainly be ready for us by the autumn. By then, I expect  to have enough to cover the population not only during the containment stage  but through the mitigation stage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Older people with clostridium difficile or MRSA will of  course be prioritised when the vaccines are eventually available. However, that  is some way off because the virus seed must be identified before they go into  production. The vaccines will be shared among countries that have placed  advance orders, including the UK.  Northern Ireland  will receive its share, and we will determine at that point who is most at  risk.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">For Mrs Robinson&rsquo;s benefit, it is clear that the people  most at risk are those aged 16 and under, not older people. In fact, the  suggestion has been made that people who are aged over 65 have some element of  immunity. However, those are clinical decisions, and I will leave it to the  clinicians to advise me on them.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  statement. I note and welcome the fact that he said that our plans are &ldquo;robust  and well rehearsed.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some media reports say that in some areas of Scotland diagnoses  are not being made by either swab or laboratory testing. Is that the case here?  What would the level of infection have to be for that to happen here? I  understand that GPs are diagnosing swine flu in some areas of Scotland. Given  that, what is our GPs&rsquo; situation? Can they diagnose? What level of infection  must be reached here before that would be required of our GPs?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: To some extent, that depends on  the progress of the virus in Northern    Ireland. Degrees of infection are being seen  in Scotland and in England that differ from those in, for example, Wales, Northern   Ireland or, indeed, the Irish Republic.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Widespread community transition is being experienced in  parts of Scotland.  In some places in Scotland,  mitigation, as opposed to containment, is operating. Mrs McGill described one  of the characteristics of a mitigation, as opposed to a containment, strategy.  We continue with our containment strategy, which has worked well so far. We  will reach the point where we move to mitigation, but none of us can predict  when that will be; it very much depends on the behaviour of the virus.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I also welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. We are reaping the rewards of having  robust and well-rehearsed plans.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It has become clear that, in dealing with swine flu, we are  in it for the long haul. I see two big challenges in that. First, the  population can become complacent about some of the messages. We must keep  reiterating and reinforcing those messages as we move forward so that people do  not think that the pandemic is over. Secondly, finance is an issue. Will a  financial burden be placed on the Health Service as the pandemic continues into  the summer and autumn?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The money that we had set aside  for a flu pandemic will not begin to deal with the cost burden as the disease  works its way through. It is clear that it is not part of my budget and that it  is a matter for others; I cannot allow for it in the health budget. At present,  the costs that are involved are still estimates. However, it seems to me that  we have no choice other than to treat swine flu seriously. As I keep saying, we  prepare for the worst and hope for the best. There will be a bill to pay, but,  if the situation becomes as serious as it could, that bill will be well worth  paying.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>: I  welcome the Minister&rsquo;s update, and I acknowledge that the Scottish patient who  sadly died had an underlying health problem. However, we are aware that people  in Scotland  were hospitalised; indeed, some of them were admitted to intensive care units. Scotland is not  in our jurisdiction, but it is a very close neighbour of ours.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Has the possibility been discussed that the strain in Scotland is a  more virulent one?</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The strain that is being dealt  with in Scotland  is the same one that we all continue to deal with. It has had a severe affect  on 10 individuals, who are in hospital, but scientists and medical experts are  unable to say why those people have been affected in that way.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I, too, thank the Minister for keeping the House and the Northern Ireland  public abreast of what is happening with swine flu. Unfortunately, a patient in  Scotland  sadly died, and I am sure that the House offers its sympathy to the family of  that person. We were told that that person had underlying health problems.  Swine flu has affected a number of patients in Northern Ireland. Do any of those  patients have underlying health problems, and, if so, will they be monitored  and given every available treatment to ensure that they have a speedy recovery?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, does the Minister have any evidence that,  during this phase of the swine flu outbreak, the wise instructions that he and  his Department issued have been adhered to throughout Northern Ireland?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: With respect to the Member&rsquo;s  latter point, we provide advice through the Public Health Agency, and Members  will have seen that advice, particularly in media adverts. We rely on the  public to be sensible and to co-operate. Co-operation is a key part of containment,  and the longer that we can contain the outbreak, the more time we can buy until  a vaccine is ready and in place.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Everybody who has tested positive for swine flu in Northern Ireland  has either recovered or is doing well. The situation in Scotland is  different; some patients there have had a mild reaction, but others have had a  severe reaction. It is early days with this new and novel virus, and no one is  clear about its characteristics. No one can yet say whether one of its  characteristics is that it is a mild strain.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  I wish to express my sincere sympathy to the family in Scotland, whose  loved one had the virus and, over the past weekend, tragically lost her fight  for life. Although I appreciate that that person was suffering from an underlying  medical problem, is the Minister able to say whether pregnant women are at a  greater risk from the virus? How does that death impact on the arrangements for  fighting the virus in Northern    Ireland?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: As I said in my statement,  although the World Health Organization has declared pandemic level 6, nothing  will change; we will carry on with the plans and preparations that we have in  place.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although it is early days, there are some indications that  pregnant women are more susceptible to the virus than the rest of the  population. With respect to fighting the virus, Tamiflu is not suitable for  pregnant women; however, suitable antivirals exist and are available to be  administered.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  statement. In addition, I apologise on behalf of my colleagues Sue Ramsey and  Michelle O&rsquo;Neill who are members of the Health Committee but who have another  engagement in the Long Gallery.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As other Members said, our thoughts and prayers are with  the family of the women who died in Scotland. Although it has been  confirmed that she tested positive for, and died from, the H1N1 virus, the  Scottish Government also confirmed that she had underlying health problems. Of  the 164 deaths worldwide that were associated with swine flu, how many of those  people had underlying health problems?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I do not readily have such a  statistical answer, and I imagine that much of the evidence is still being  collated.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, as I informed the House before, there has been an  alarming degree of under-reporting in other countries. We are not clear about  how many of the people whose deaths were ascribed to swine flu had underlying  conditions and how many did not, but it is clear that there have been instances  worldwide of perfectly healthy individuals, with no underlying conditions,  contracting the virus and dying. There are no lessons that have been learned  that I can relate to the House. It is still very early days as far as the  scientific investigation is concerned.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  Will the Minister tell us what contact he has had with colleagues in the Republic of Ireland? What level have they reached as  regards their treatment, analysis and policy? Will he also tell the House  whether the eight people who have contracted swine flu in Northern Ireland  have been treated at home or have been admitted to hospital? Will he indicate  the earliest date at which he expects to receive vaccines to treat swine flu?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: There are 12 patients in the Republic of Ireland who have tested positive. My  discussions with the Republic   of Ireland show that it  has adequate supplies of antivirals and has orders in place for vaccines.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As far as Northern    Ireland is concerned, I am not aware of any  of our patients who have tested positive going to hospital. They have been able  to fight the virus at home with the support of the Health Service and antiviral  treatments. As I keep saying, I am not in a position to say when we will  receive vaccines, but we will not get all of our vaccines in one delivery: it  will be an extended delivery because of the capacity of factories that produce  the vaccines and because of the number of countries that require the vaccines.  However, we are top of the queue thanks to the UK  response and to our being part of the UK. Northern Ireland will get its full  share of the 132 million vaccines that have been ordered.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Once the virus seed has been isolated and vaccine production  starts, we should be seeing the vaccines before the end of the year. We will  then determine who receives them first. High-impact employees, for example  those in the Health Service and vulnerable groups, will be key, but that is  very much in the future.</p>
    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="5"></a>Executive Committee Business</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Supply Resolution for the 2009-2010 Main Estimates</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to four hours for  the debate. The Minister will have a total of one hour to allocate between  proposing and winding on the motion, and all other Members will have 10  minutes. If that is clear, we shall proceed.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment (Mrs Foster)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly approves that a sum, not exceeding  &pound;7,566,927,000, be granted out of the Consolidated Fund, for or towards  defraying the charges for Northern Ireland Departments, the Northern Ireland  Assembly Commission, the Assembly Ombudsman for Northern Ireland and Northern  Ireland Commissioner for Complaints, the Food Standards Agency, the Northern  Ireland Audit Office and the Northern Ireland Authority for Utility Regulation  for the year ending 31st March 2010 and that resources, not exceeding &pound;8,311,830,000,  be authorised for use by Northern Ireland Departments, the Northern Ireland  Assembly Commission, the Assembly Ombudsman for Northern Ireland and Northern  Ireland Commissioner for Complaints, the Food Standards Agency, the Northern  Ireland Audit Office and the Northern Ireland Authority for Utility Regulation  for the year ending 31st March 2010 as summarised for each Department or other  public body in columns 3(b) and 3(a) of table 1.3 in the volume of the Northern  Ireland Estimates 2009-10 that was laid before the Assembly on 29 May 2009.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion was tabled in the name of the Minister of  Finance and Personnel. This important Supply resolution seeks the Assembly&rsquo;s  approval of the spending plans of Departments and other public bodies as set  out in the Main Estimates for 2009-2010, which were presented on 29 May 2009. I  request and recommend the level of Supply set out in the resolution under  section 63 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 on behalf of the Executive.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Members will be aware, at present, Departments are  spending money and using resources on the basis of the Vote on Account in the  Budget Act (Northern Ireland)  2009, which was passed by the Assembly in February. As the Vote on Account  provides only initial allocations for 2009-2010 based on 45% of the 2008-09 provision,  it is now essential that further resources and cash be approved before the  summer recess to enable public services to continue for the remainder of the  current financial year.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The departmental spending plans in the 2009-2010 Main  Estimates are based on the second year of the Executive&rsquo;s Budget 2008-2011,  which was approved by the Assembly in January of last year. However, the  estimates reflect some technical adjustments that have been made since then.  They are a result of reclassification changes or revised budgeting treatment  and, in some instances, of transfers between Departments or from the Northern  Ireland Office.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are two key issues in relation to the adjustments.  First, adjustments to budgets as a consequence of reclassification changes or  revised budgeting treatment do not provide additional spending power to the  Executive. That is based on the accepted policy that service delivery should  not be affected by such changes. Therefore, although there is an adjustment to  the overall Northern Ireland Executive departmental expenditure limit, the  result is to maintain spending power at the same level. Secondly, adjustments  that are transfers between Departments do not reflect changes in total spending  power, but rather that the Budget provision is merely following the service  provided.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, Members will recall that estimates also  include almost &pound;6 billion of annually managed expenditure (AME). That  expenditure is demand-led and is updated at least twice per annum. Therefore,  the estimates also reflect updates to the AME allocations published in the  Budget 2008-2011 document in January 2008.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The amounts of cash, over &pound;7&middot;6 billion, and resources, over  &pound;8&middot;3 billion, sought in the Supply resolution are substantial in addition to  the February Vote on Account. The Main Estimates under debate today bring the  total requirements for 2009-2010 to over &pound;13 billion cash and &pound;15 billion  resource. Although the Minister of Finance and Personnel approves and presents the  estimates, and I am doing that today on his behalf, the underlying detail  reflects decisions taken by Ministers under the financial authority delegated  to them by the Department of Finance and Personnel. Those are the estimates of  each Minister; they detail the services planned for delivery in 2009-2010 by  each Minister within their Budget allocation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although today&rsquo;s focus is understandably on the amount of  funding being made available to Departments with, for example, the Budget  allocation for schools set to increase by 6% this year, it is important that we  do not lose sight of the fact that the primary purpose of Departments is not to  spend money but to provide high-quality, accessible public services for all  Northern Ireland&rsquo;s people. Therefore, although I am sure that during today&rsquo;s  debate many Members will highlight their concerns regarding the funding  available for one service or another, I would first like to set out some of the  service improvements that will be funded from the estimates that we are  discussing today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">For example, the allocations will allow the completion of  the work under the farm nutrient management scheme, achieving cleaner water and  EU compliance, while, at the same time, providing much-needed work for the  construction industry. The 2009-2010 year is the second year of the five-year Northern Ireland  rural development programme. At a total value of over &pound;0&middot;5 billion, the further  investment this year will improve the competitiveness of the sector, enhance  the environment and improve the quality of life in rural areas. If passed  today, the 2009-2010 expenditure plans will enable the continued delivery of  high-quality primary, secondary and tertiary education services across Northern Ireland.  Evidence of that can be seen in the &pound;45 million contract signed recently to  provide four new schools in Portglenone, Carryduff, Knock and Downpatrick.  During these difficult economic times, that is good news for our local  construction industry.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, reflecting the Executive&rsquo;s commitment to  lifelong learning, the South Eastern Regional  College buildings programme is well  under way, construction has begun on the Belfast  Metropolitan College  development in the Titanic Quarter, and the new skills centre for the South West   College at Enniskillen is  expected to be completed next month.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, the Skillsafe scheme, which was announced on  26 May, will, initially, assist engineering and manufacturing apprentices who  have been placed on short-term working to use their downtime to undertake  accredited training that will contribute to their apprenticeships. That  represents practical help and protection for apprentices in the current  challenging economic environment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Invest Northern Ireland,  for which the Department of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment (DETI) is responsible, continues to work proactively with  local companies and entrepreneurs to help to minimise the impact of the  economic downturn. The expenditure plans before the House will fund initiatives  such as the accelerated support fund, which provides advice and support to  companies that are suffering the adverse effects of the downturn. In addition,  the short-term aid scheme, which I announced recently, will provide valuable  support to structurally sound local firms that have a significant presence in  export markets, but which are experiencing short-term difficulties due to the  global downturn.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In health and social care, building work is about to  commence on the new acute hospital in Enniskillen. As well as providing the  latest health services for the people of the south-west, that project will  bring timely economic benefits. Over the construction period, 850 jobs will be  supported through the project, of which 180 will be new. In addition, the new Downe Hospital  is due to open to the public at the end of the month. It will provide  state-of-the-art medical facilities and services to south Down. Construction  will continue on two health and well-being centres in Belfast, which will provide employment for  almost 200 people.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A dental contract will be introduced in 2009-2010, which  will provide access to dental services for 57,000 additional patients. That is  particularly good news for areas in Northern Ireland where, recently,  access to Health Service dental treatment has been difficult, something that I  know a lot about.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Those are examples of the improvements in services that the  Executive intend to deliver this year. Overall, the 2009-2010 provision in the  Estimates will enable the continued delivery of the vital core services,  including hospital services; community and primary care; social services; and  mental-health and learning-disability programmes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Turning to roads, the recent completion of the widening  works on the M1, Westlink and the M2 will reduce congestion and benefit the  economy. The 2009-2010 Department for Regional Development (DRD) expenditure  plans that are before the House will ensure the continued improvement of our  road infrastructure. However, there must be an appropriate balance of  development between the private and public transport sectors, with further  investment in this financial year on new trains to increase frequency and  capacity in the greater Belfast area and on the Belfast to Londonderry  line.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I could not conclude this brief summary of some of the main  services that are planned for 2009-2010 without mentioning the numerous social  security benefits, totalling over &pound;3 billion, that the Department for Social  Development (DSD) will administer during that period. The passing of the Supply  resolution and the approval of the 2009-2010 Main Estimates will enable pension  benefits and credit, disability benefits, income support, housing benefits and  winter fuel payments, to name but a few, to be paid for the remainder of  2009-2010. Those benefits are crucial to many families at this time of economic  downturn, and they underline the importance of the Supply resolution.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The continuation of funding for social and affordable  housing, as well as the important support for the community and voluntary  sector, is also vital to our communities, and the Department for Social  Development has the largest capital allocation of any Northern Ireland  Department over the next two years.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The importance of this stage of the public expenditure  cycle, including the Assembly&rsquo;s anticipated approval of the Supply resolution  and the associated expenditure plans that are laid out in the 2009-2010 Main  Estimates, cannot be overestimated. Failure to approve the resolution would  result in serious consequences for public services, which I have highlighted. Departments  would run out of cash and public services would grind to a halt, something for  which the people of Northern    Ireland would not forgive the  Administration.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The forthcoming June monitoring round, and those for the  remainder of 2009-2010, will provide the opportunity for a revision of the  plans in light of changing circumstances.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that, during today&rsquo;s debate, Members will avail  themselves of the opportunity to provide their advice and recommendations to  the Finance Minister and the Executive on our proposed revisions for 2009-2010.  Maybe more in hope than in expectation, I ask Members to put forward their  spending proposals in tandem with sensible proposals for reductions in public  spending elsewhere in the Budget.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Following this debate and the passing of the Supply  resolution, I intend to introduce the related Budget Bill. As this is the fifth  time since May 2007 that the Assembly has gone through this process, Members will  be familiar by now with the need for the accelerated passage of the Bill, as  specifically recognised in Standing Order 42(2) of this Assembly. Once again, I  acknowledge the vital role played by the Committee for Finance and Personnel  and its pragmatic approach to that matter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members will also be familiar by now with the differences  between Budgets and Estimates. Estimates reflect the spending plans of  Departments, while the Budget reflects the spending plans of the wider public sector,  including arm&rsquo;s-length bodies. Those differences are reflected in the resource  and capital reconciliation tables, from Estimates to Budgets, in the supporting  statements section of each Department&rsquo;s estimate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I remind Members of the significance of today&rsquo;s business.  Approval by this legislature of the 2009-2010 Estimates and today&rsquo;s Supply  resolution will provide Departments with the legal authority to spend cash and  use resources on the services that they plan to deliver, up to the limit that  is set out in the 2009-2010 Estimates, the Supply resolution and the related  Budget Bill. That means that this House will subsequently hold Departments accountable  for managing and controlling their spending and resources within the limits  authorised today. Any breach of the limits set by this Assembly will be  reported by the Comptroller and Auditor General to the Public Accounts  Committee, following his examination of departmental resource accounts.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When referring to the spending plans for the Budget today,  some Members will, I expect, press again the case for the Executive to take  forward a formal budget process in light of the changes in economic  circumstances or, indeed, for other less benign reasons. However, the Executive  already have procedures in place to allow changes to be made to existing  expenditure plans throughout the in-year monitoring process. With regard to the  economic downturn, that process allowed the Finance Minister to announce a  significant financial support package as part of December monitoring, while  recent initiatives by the Department for Employment and Learning (DEL) and my  Department were taken forward without the need for a Budget process.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive are not being dogmatic in that respect, as a  Budget process would be taken forward were it required. However, to date, no  proposals have been put forward that cannot be accommodated through in-year  monitoring. I hope that Members agree that Departments and public bodies should  focus on delivering public services and supporting industry, rather than  indulging in a costly, bureaucratic and distracting Budget exercise.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  The Minister said that monitoring rounds are sufficient to allow flexibility in  dealing with different economic circumstances. However, does she accept that  monitoring rounds are themselves limited to the amounts that Departments  surrender or the Barnett consequentials that the Executive receive, and that,  unlike a Budget, they cannot delve into existing policies and practices to see  whether they are still relevant or whether moneys could be better spent  elsewhere?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: I am sure that we will have a full and open debate about the  Budget process during the next couple of hours and, indeed, tomorrow. Nothing  has come before the Executive yet that has not been able to be accommodated by  the monitoring rounds; that is what the Finance Minister is saying clearly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to make a final point about the presentation of the  Estimates document, which I hope Members have had an opportunity to look at.  The more observant Members will have noticed the new look for the 2009-2010 Estimates.  In recent years, the Estimates documents have been printed on high-quality,  glossy, coated art paper &mdash; I notice that the Member beside me is flicking through  a previous one &mdash; with coloured pages separating each Department and the  supporting documentation. In line with the Department of Finance and  Personnel&rsquo;s (DFP) sustainable development policy, this year the Estimates have  been printed in black and white on recycled paper containing 75% post-consumer  waste. In addition, that has reduced the cost of printing the volume in line  with DFP&rsquo;s efficiency savings programme. I am sure that Members will not mind  that at all.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, as we approve the opening departmental positions  for this financial year as set out in the 2009-2010 Estimates, some difficult  decisions lie ahead for the in-year monitoring rounds. No doubt, many Members  will demand additional funding for many worthwhile projects and services, and  they will probably do so during the debate; in fact, I know that they will.  However, I ask Members to remember that we have a finite Budget, and any  demands that are made today for additional funding should be accompanied by  recommendations as to where that additional funding should be found. Our task  is to juggle competing priorities within a limited Budget so that we deliver  our public services. I look forward to a healthy and robust debate on those issues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I ask Members to support the resolution to approve the  opening position for the 2009-2010 year and to ensure that provision is made  for vital public services to continue beyond the current position in the Vote  on Account.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Finance and Personnel (Mr McLaughlin)</strong>: Go raibh maith  agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment for being  here to represent the Minister of Finance and Personnel, who cannot be here  today. If we were to pay attention to some of the comments in the media, that  might be seen as something of a rehearsal. However, I commend the Minister for  her detailed and precise presentation of the resolution and the Budget targets.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Senior departmental officials briefed the Committee for  Finance and Personnel on 27 May 2009 on the Main Estimates for 2009-2010 and  the associated Budget (No 2) Bill, which gives legislative approval to the  Estimates and which is to be introduced in the Assembly following this debate.  Advanced copies of the Main Estimates were made available to Committee members  prior to the briefing, and departmental officials also provided the Committee  with a paper that reconciled the figures in the Budget to those in the Main  Estimates for 2009-2010.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At departmental level, the main difference in DFP&rsquo;s  allocations in the Executive Budget and the Main Estimates for 2009-2010  related to an additional &pound;4&middot;1 million transfer from the Office of the First  Minister and deputy First Minister (OFMDFM) for the central reform of IT  services. Following the briefing, the Committee for Finance and Personnel  agreed to support accelerated passage for the Budget (No 2) Bill for 2009.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the Minister said, the Main Estimates and the associated  Budget (No 2) Bill are the outworkings of the process to finalise the  Executive&rsquo;s Budget for 2008-2011, which the Assembly agreed in January 2008. In  December 2007 when the Budget was at draft stage, my Committee published a  report that included substantive submissions from all the Assembly&rsquo;s Statutory  Committees. The Committee received a formal response to that report, and it is  continuing to monitor the implementations of its recommendations, especially  those to improve financial management in Departments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The underlying spending plans for 2009-2010 brought forward  in the Main Estimates reflect the position established in the second year of  the Executive&rsquo;s three-year Budget. Although the Budget for 2008-2011 has been  agreed already, Members should be aware that the Assembly and its Statutory Committees  can have an input to the reprioritisation of resources in 2009-2010 via the  in-year quarterly monitoring rounds. Indeed, the Minister referred specifically  to that point, which I support</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department completed a review of the monitoring-round process  at the end of March 2009, and my Committee is waiting to be briefed on the  outcome of that review. I urge the Minister to ensure that that report is made  available as soon as possible, because, due to the ever-increasing pressures on  resources and the rising concerns as expressed by all parties in the Assembly,  it is extremely important that the monitoring-round process is as effective and  transparent as possible.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Another area that may have an impact on the expenditure  proposals in the Main Estimates for 2009-2010 is the achievement of existing  targets for efficiency savings, especially given the added challenge of the  pending additional efficiency cuts that were signalled in the Chancellor&rsquo;s  recent Budget announcement. The Committee has been briefed by the Department on  progress in delivering the Department&rsquo;s own efficiency plans in 2008-09, and  officials have raised concern already at the impact that efficiency targets may  have on delivery in this financial year, 2009-2010. I urge the other statutory  Committees to continue to scrutinise the efficiency delivery plans of their  respective Departments.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">1.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At a more strategic level, officials from the Department of  Finance and Personnel&rsquo;s central finance group gave evidence to the Committee in  January 2009 and informed members that they had undertaken a qualitative  analysis of departmental efficiency delivery plans. Almost five months ago, the  Committee requested a copy of that analysis, but, disappointingly, we have yet to  receive it. I ask the Department to make that analysis available forthwith,  and, in the interim, perhaps the Minister will comment on the potential  pressures that efficiency targets may place on this year&rsquo;s Budget.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Budget for 2008-2011 made provision for capital  receipts of &pound;486 million for 2008-09 and &pound;266 million for 2009-2010. That  included a planned receipt in 2008-09 of &pound;175 million for the Department of  Finance and Personnel from the Workplace 2010 programme, but those funds were  not realised as the planned sale of accommodation under that programme was not  taken forward. Will the Minister outline how shortfalls in capital receipts for  last year and the uncertainties that abound regarding the achievement of the  2009-2010 target have been built into those estimates? If no such provisions  exist, will the Minister indicate what options are currently available to the  Executive to address in-year budgetary pressures for 2009-2010?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Stopping the Workplace 2010 procurement exercise has had  expenditure ramifications for the Department of Finance and Personnel&rsquo;s own  budget beyond the loss of the &pound;175 million capital receipt. Much of the public  sector estate, as I believe all Members will be aware, is in urgent need of  maintenance, with health and safety implications now having to be addressed by  the Department.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Indeed, the Department of Finance and Personnel has already  submitted a &pound;6 million bid in the June monitoring round for urgent maintenance  to the Civil Service office estate. That Department also has a lead  responsibility for a number of Civil Service reform programmes, and, despite  previous assurances that those will be funded from the monitoring round  process, many of the Department&rsquo;s bids in relation to those programmes were not  met last year. A further bid of &pound;15 million was submitted in June, and we wait  to see whether that will be met.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Already, it is apparent that the Department&rsquo;s budget for  2009-2010 is under pressure. The Department submitted bids totalling &pound;26  million for the June monitoring round, which is a very early stage in the  financial year and is against an opening departmental baseline of &pound;190 million.  In the past, DFP officials have stated that more revenue will be generated from  an improved performance in the collection of rates by Land and Property  Services, and the Committee has taken a very focused and critical interest in  that body. It has asked to be briefed as soon as possible on the performance  and efficiency delivery unit&rsquo;s review of it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Going forward, the Committee must agree an efficient and  effective process for scrutinising and agreeing future Budgets. My Committee  has already made representations in that regard, including a submission on the  Budget process, made in October 2008. However, the Committee is still waiting  for a response from the Department of Finance and Personnel on the  recommendations in that submission and an outline of the Department&rsquo;s views on  a future process. That must be addressed as a matter or urgency.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, I want to speak on behalf of my party. For  Sinn F&eacute;in, tackling the economic and fiscal crisis is a key priority for the  Assembly and the Executive. At a time of economic crisis, it is even more  critical that those who are most disadvantaged and in the greatest need are  given additional help and assistance. My party recognises that the Executive  have been very alive to that priority.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Given the efficiency savings pressures that exist, including  those that are being proposed by the Chancellor and the Treasury, there is a  need for an all-party commitment to defending front-line public services. Sinn  F&eacute;in supports greater efficiency savings, but such savings should be made in  obvious areas, such as the bonuses received by senior civil servants and the  grossly inflated salaries of some in public bodies. Front-line services must  not be the first resort; indeed, they must be defended. Sinn F&eacute;in believes &mdash; I  think that other parties would expect us to &mdash; that, given the financial and  economic constraints affecting the Southern economy and our regional economy,  there is a need for greater co-operation, particularly on delivering shared  services, especially in the border area. It is simply a waste of time and money  to deliver such services on a back-to-back basis. It is a particular waste when  the economy is under such pressure.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development (Dr W McCrea)</strong>: I  speak as the Chairperson of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural  Development, and I will limit my comments to the Estimates that are relevant to  that Department.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This has not been an easy year for the agriculture  industry, and everyone who knows that industry is aware of the challenges,  including the high costs of fuel, feedstuffs and fertilisers that are impacting  on farm businesses across the sector. In addition, the severe weather in the  summer of 2008 played havoc with, in particular, the potato and cereal sectors.  I therefore thank the Minister of Finance and Personnel and his Executive  colleagues for agreeing to lessen the burden on small but important parts of  the industry through the hardship schemes for the fishing and potato  industries. Those small amounts of money have been important in securing family  businesses and have certainly not been taken for granted. I also welcome the  additional &pound;2&middot;3 million that has been made available for the south Down fishing  village programme. That will provide much-needed support to communities that  have been negatively impacted as a result of the difficulties faced by the  fishing industry on which they are dependent.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Overall, the Department of Agriculture and Rural  Development will see a net increase in its cash requirement of just over &pound;40  million. That is to be welcomed. The highest proportion of that, some &pound;29 million,  relates to the farm nutrient management scheme, which will allow Northern Ireland  to be compliant with the EU nitrates directives. It should be noted that, as  with most schemes of that nature, the grant that is payable represents only 40%  of the total cost of carrying out those works, the balance of 60% having been  found by the farm businesses. That represents a major investment in Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  rural economy by farm business at a time of severe economic downturn.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that the House will agree that we ought to  congratulate farmers on their bravery in investing their hard-earned moneys in  their businesses and in the economy. I also call on the Department of  Agriculture and Rural Development to ensure that it processes the outstanding  claims with as much speed as possible, because most farmers will have had to  borrow money in order to invest. It would be a total injustice to them and  their willingness to support their local and national economies if they had to  incur huge bank fees because of the apathy of the Department in processing  claims. That is vital because many farmers have not received much help from the  banks. In fact, fees have been burdensome at a time when farmers have had so  many other economic pressures. It is therefore very important for the  Department to pass on the money as quickly as possible, and all steps must be  taken to allow that to happen. If positions must be rejigged within the  Department to make that happen, that must be done, as many farmers have  received a half payment but are still short of the other half and have had to  subsidise that for the benefit of everyone and the environment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although it is not strictly relevant to the debate, my  Committee also notes the willingness of family farm businesses to invest in the  modernisation of their enterprises.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I call on the Department to examine critically its budget  provisions in the Northern    Ireland rural development programme to  determine whether shortfalls in parts of the overall programme budget can be  transferred to that worthwhile and well-supported scheme. The leverage of  approximately 60% of overall costs from the private sector &mdash; the farmers  themselves &mdash; will massively boost the local economy and local businesses beyond  those that are involved in farming. For example, it will boost light  engineering and processing companies. I ask the Executive to encourage that to  be a reality, because it is vital to get the money circulating in Northern Ireland.  I take my hat off to the farmers, who, in these times in which they face so  many challenges, are up-front in investing their own money in the industry&rsquo;s  future and in the Northern    Ireland economy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although the Committee supports the Department in such  matters, it is concerned about some traditional allocations, particularly that  for disease control. We note that an element of the &pound;12&middot;5 million increase  given to the Department&rsquo;s central policy group is for animal disease  compensation. I am not sure whether that figure includes the bid for an  additional &pound;6 million that was made in the June monitoring round. Irrespective of  that, it is evident that the Department is not controlling the diseases that  are most relevant to Northern    Ireland agriculture, particularly TB. The  Minister of the Environment has given the Department of Agriculture and Rural  Development approval for a limited badger cull, yet DARD has been totally  inactive on that. The Committee calls on the Department to take the brave  decision to eradicate animal diseases, thus saving the Northern Ireland  block more than &pound;60 million a year. That is no small amount of money, so the  Minister must take every possible action to ensure that the money is well  spent. I am sure that the Minister of Finance and Personnel will consider the  situation very carefully, because that is a recurrent amount of money that is  being spent in Northern    Ireland. The underlying problem of  eradication of disease is not being dealt with. Action must come from the  Department of Agriculture and Rural Development.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee notes that the spring Supplementary Estimates  identify a number of significant decreases, for reasons such as the  reallocation of administrative budgets. We appreciate that those decreases are  subsequently reallocated across Departments and the Northern Ireland block, but we are  concerned that they are happening. Therefore, we call on the Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development to assure the Committee and, more  importantly, the rural community that the decreases will not result in a  decline in the provision of front line services to rural Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee is pleased at the additional moneys that are  coming to the Department. We hope that the Department will continue to work  with the industry to promote a stronger, more vibrant industry and rural  economy.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  The outgoing Minister of Finance and Personnel either holds this place in  contempt or has a genuine reason for his absence. Therefore, it would be  appropriate to hear the reason that Mr Dodds has for not attending. I shall not  speculate or fuel rumours about his future or that of other DUP Ministers as  they dispose of double-jobbing in a party reshuffle to hide their unbounded  embarrassment, but the fact that the outgoing Minister is not here today and, I  understand, will not be here tomorrow for the Second Stage of the Budget (No.  2) Bill tells its own story and adds only to vivid speculation. He should be  here. The reason for his not being here needs to be better than &ldquo;very good&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Perhaps the interim Minister could explain why the  Department is not accepting any spending bids for the June monitoring round. Is  that not an exceptional situation that deserves explanation? Has a decision been  taken that effectively means a scenario of massive overspend, or an  unwillingness to admit reliance on underspends, which creates an inability to  balance the books not at the end of the year but in the first quarter? In other  institutions, a message that instructs Departments not to make a bid would set  alarm bells ringing. Is that a message of prudence, or has spending been  excessive and the purse emptied? Is such an instruction from a Government not  unprecedented? Will the interim Minister take time to allay the genuine fears  that are circulating that the Department is overseeing the stretching of the Northern Ireland  block grant to levels that cannot be sustained?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The refusal of the Finance Minister to shift on  reprioritising the Budget must be one of the foremost examples of political  inflexibility and rigidity in the modern legislative arena. As we vote for the  Supply resolution, we vote to sustain a system that predates the world  financial crisis and the recession that occasioned the rewriting of budgets and  the redesign of governmental fiscal structures across the world in every  country except Northern    Ireland. &ldquo;No change here&rdquo; is the slogan.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">1.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, there is change here. When I first raised  this matter last October, there were 29,000 people unemployed. Today, that  figure has risen to over 47,000. One might suppose that those horrendous  figures would present a learning curve steep enough for even the outgoing  Finance Minister to recognise that he might possibly have been mistaken in not  reordering the priorities of the Programme for Government. However, his refusal  to move on that matter earns the cosy coalition the title &ldquo;the do-nothing  Government&rdquo;, presiding over a situation in which 81% of this Assembly&rsquo;s time is  taken up with private Members&rsquo; motions that are not binding on Ministers and  only 18% is taken up with Government business. That is a scandalous state of  affairs that cannot continue. After the humiliation and reversal of last week&rsquo;s  election result, one hoped that there might be a rewriting of the Programme for  Government. However, the DUP are like the Bourbons after the French revolution:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;They have learnt nothing, and forgotten nothing.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We vote today on a Supply resolution and associated Budget  designed for a world before the worst recession and banking crisis since 1929.  I ask the Minister once again, even at this late stage, to think again and  order a thoroughgoing review of the priorities in the Programme for Government.  I ask that in the name of the 47,000 unemployed and those who daily increase  that number and of those who live in fear that their jobs will be terminated  tomorrow or even today. I ask it on the grounds of common sense.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">What about the black hole, which was &pound;1 billion and rising  at the last count? When will someone level with us as to how the  deficit-financing scheme is performing? How many Departments have underspent so  that they can balance their books? When will someone withdraw the bonuses of  senior civil servants in Departments that have underspent and failed the  public? Will someone tell the House what will happen after 2011, when  efficiency savings of &pound;14 billion will be imposed throughout the United Kingdom  legislatures? What are the contingency plans for that situation? Members want  to hear from someone with ministerial responsibility for finance.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Until now, yesterday&rsquo;s Finance Minister had been building  his latest house of cards around the suggestion that all of the pain would come  after 2011: bully for him. However, it goes without saying that, if the  Chancellor proposes a three-year spending review, that will lead, almost  inevitably, to a reduction in the block grant before 2011. That is what is  likely to hit Northern    Ireland; that is the pain that is coming  very soon.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Sound Government finance is not theory. It can never be  established by creating a Programme for Government before a worldwide economic  crisis erupts and then sticking to it rigidly, no matter what happens in the  economy or in the real world. Of course, it must be difficult for  double-jobbers and treble-jobbers to latch on to that fact. Let us face it:  their multiple salaries cushion them from the impact of an economic downturn or  recession very nicely.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That fact has resonated with an electorate who are fed up  with false promises. It has struck home with people who, last week, struck back  and sent the DUP crashing. Those people are indignant and angry at seeing that  their trust has been misplaced. What is being talked about today, regarding the  Supply resolution, is the highlighting of a financial situation and the fact  that the person charged with responsibility happens to be somewhere else. We do  not know where. The House deserves better, and I hope that that is what it will  get in the not-too-distant future.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  am pleased to contribute to the debate on the Supply resolution. Some time ago,  Jonathan Swift made a modest proposal to deal with the enormous poverty and  hardship that existed on the island   of Ireland at that time.  He proposed that the people of Ireland  should eat their babies. I want to start with a modest proposal to deal with  the current crisis in Government finances: the Assembly should abolish the post  of Minister of Finance and Personnel. It is a modest proposal, which would be  easier to realise than Swift&rsquo;s for the simple reason that the Northern Ireland  public would not notice any difference.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister of Finance and Personnel says that a  three-year Budget has been created and that, no matter how the world changes  around him, he will not alter it. The Finance Minister&rsquo;s function is,  essentially, to create the Budget. He says that he has created a Budget and  that it still stands. At the start of the debate, Minister Foster made a speech  which could have been written 18 months ago. Indeed, quite probably, civil  servants wrote it when the Minister of Finance announced his three-year Budget,  and it has simply been cut and pasted from that speech. That is consistent with  his position. He says that there is no need to make any change to the Budget.  Therefore, I offer my modest proposal to the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP expressed serious concerns about the three-year  Budget and the Programme for Government at the time of their creation. Many of  my party&rsquo;s fears have been realised. We remain gravely concerned about the  extent to which the Budget was predicated upon efficiency savings and asset  sales, asset sales that have not been realised. That has led to major concerns  from a range of organisations and sectors about subsequent cuts in front line  services. A senior Housing Executive manager said that he is operating in the  most difficult funding environment that he has ever operated in, and a senior  Health Service manager said that efficiency savings are simply cuts across the  Budget that directly impact on front line service.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The global and, consequently, the local economic climates  have shifted hugely in the past year to 18 months. The Executive have done  remarkably little to take account of that. The deferral of water charges is a  significant issue, and we have talked before about the lack of ring-fenced  money to deliver much-needed services for children and young people.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">During last year&rsquo;s debate on the Supply resolution, the  SDLP expressed serious concerns about the ability of the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in to  deliver a coherent strategy of government based on a shared society. There have  been some high points, and, when good things are done, I recognise them.  Politicians on all sides of the House rose to the occasion and showed what a  shared society could mean after the recent tragedy of the murders at Massereene  barracks. However, there is no question that that approach is not broadly  sustained in the day-to-day realities of delivery in the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The public have a vague sense that the Assembly is not  delivering. However, people would be shocked if they knew how little business  is before the Assembly. The reality is that numerous issues and papers are logjammed  because of conflict between the Democratic Unionist Party and Sinn F&eacute;in. The  two parties have managed to deliver, at best, a fraction of what was promised  in the Programme for Government, and the Executive seem to lack strategy and  leadership. They talk about delivering for the economy, but the SDLP has  identified many issues in its significant paper, &lsquo;New Priorities in Difficult  Times&rsquo;, and our lead has not been followed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has  stated that he wants to always be:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;flexible and responsive to changing circumstances.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official  Report, Vol 40, No 3, p152, col 1].</span></span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Moreover, a senior Department official referred to  the &ldquo;cessation of low-priority programmes.&rdquo; However, those approaches differ  from the Minister&rsquo;s actual decisions on this, which have meant no change to the  Budget in light of the colossal change in economic circumstances. Yet again,  the SDLP calls on the Minister to prioritise retraining, helping small and  medium-sized businesses and putting more money into social housing and the  green economy, particularly energy efficiency.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want the House to recognise that I give credit where it  is due. I have heard sound and good feedback about Invest Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  credit crunch seminars and its follow-through, which provides diagnostic input  to businesses. I welcome the two recent ministerial statements about retraining  and apprenticeships. However, not nearly enough has been done. As Stephen Farry  said, it is not good enough to say that we can address those issues through  monitoring rounds alone. I spoke earlier about abolishing the post of Minister  of Finance; perhaps we need a Minister for monitoring rounds.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is worth commenting on the interesting little example of  Workplace 2010, which collapsed. I could say much about the reasons for that  collapse and what it indicates about the Department&rsquo;s management of the  project. We have been told that that financial hit was taken last year, and it  has been suggested that we are through that problem. We are not through that  problem. The &pound;175 million that ought to have been available through last year&rsquo;s  Budget should have been used to deliver projects. However, those projects have  not been delivered.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">1.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are other Workplace 2010 issues, such as the  decentralisation of posts, which was one of the funda&shy;mental political  challenges that faced the Assembly. On the face of it, each party in the  Assembly subscribed to decentralisation, but the degree to which it was written  into Workplace 2010 was unclear from the outset. There now seems to be no  commitment to the proposals in the Bain Review on policy on the location of  public-sector jobs in Northern    Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The collapse of Workplace 2010 means that the Civil Service  estate is not fit for purpose, and no revised proposals have been made on how  to put that right.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We were told last year that the Civil Service equal pay  claim would cost at least &pound;100 million. Is the Minister going to tell us that,  in light of the resolution in the House on 1 June 2009, he will resolve that  issue and pay those civil servants what they are entitled to within three  months?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s announcement on senior Civil  Service pay and bonuses, but we need more detail about how and when that will  happen.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister will know that the Committee for Finance and  Personnel has embarked on a major inquiry into public procurement because of  serious concerns that the system is not working. Legal challenges have been  made, and owners of small and medium-sized businesses say that they cannot get  a slice of the action. There has been a failure to use social and environmental  clauses to deal with the current economic situation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are many other issues that I want to address, but  they will have to wait for another occasion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member must draw his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  There will be another opportunity tomorrow when we debate the Budget (No. 2)  Bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  apologise for missing the first few minutes of the Minister&rsquo;s statement; I was  in a Committee meeting.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome Arlene Foster to the Chamber today; she has been  a dextrous Minister in the past few days in fulfilling a number of roles, which  may be a portent for the future. We do not need to abolish the post of Minister  of Finance and Personnel; finance is an integral part of government around the  world. However, I concede that we need a change of direction with regard to  budgets, and a change of personnel may assist us in that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is frustration not only in the Chamber but across the  whole of society about the inability of the Assembly to respond more  effectively to the effects of the economic downturn on Northern Ireland  and to plan for economic recovery when it comes. We should be optimistic in  that regard. There is a lack of flexibility in what we do, which stands in  stark contrast to what is happening in virtually every other jurisdiction  around the world as they wrestle with the economic situation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are locked into the figures that were set out in the  2008-2011 Budget, with some minor modifications. Nevertheless, it is worth  stressing that even the changes that were made in previous monitoring rounds do  not affect the underlying baselines. For example, the Minister mentioned what I  now call the &pound;150 spring fuel payment, as opposed to the winter fuel payment.  That one-off payment was taken out of the &pound;25 million fund that was set up  under the Financial Assistance Act (Northern Ireland) 2009; it remains to  be seen whether a similar decision will be taken for next winter. If that is  the case, it begs the question of whether it is better to invest in energy  efficiency in people&rsquo;s houses rather than giving them payments every year.  Surely that would provide a more longer-term benefit for people who are in fuel  poverty.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that we nail the wider issue of monitoring  rounds. The Executive have made a lot of the fact that monitoring rounds exist  to deal with flexibility and to allow Northern Ireland to respond to  changing circumstances. That may be true to an extent, but the extent to which  it is true is extremely limited. Monitoring rounds are determined by two  factors: first, what Departments are prepared to surrender as underspends; and,  secondly, what Barnett consequentials come to Northern Ireland. However, I will  say more about that shortly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Monitoring rounds do not have the same effect as a Budget.  They do not allow for a review of existing policies and programmes to see  whether we are responding to situations as efficiently and cost-effectively as  possible. At the same time, they do not allow us to ascertain whether current  programmes are redundant or whether money can be better or more efficiently  used for other, more productive purposes. That means that we are missing out on  that root-and-branch analysis of what we do with the very limited and scarce  resources that are available to us.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Claims have been made that through monitoring rounds, large  amounts of money have been changed between Budget headings. Again, it is worth  stressing that few of those changes relate to the specifics of dealing with a  recession in Northern    Ireland. A lot of the changes have been made  to simply meet demands from Departments, or more usually, to help in situations  where funding pressures have been created, whether through Workplace 2010 or  the Executive making a decision without having worked out the cost of further  deferrals of water charges, for example. Even today, we are faced with a paper  from the Minister for Regional Development calling for the further deferral of  water charges beyond 2011. That may be the right thing to do if we weigh up all  the different and competing demands facing Northern Ireland. However, I find  it incredible that we are talking about making a decision on future spending  before we even get sight of what the 2011-14 comprehensive spending review will  mean for resources for Northern    Ireland. If we think about financial  management, that is an amazing situation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have also heard talk of a &pound;1 billion black hole. I am  not going to go down that route, because that is essentially a notional figure  somewhere between the maximum amount of future demands from Departments and  resources being surrendered. In practice, the sum will be a lot less than that.  However, we are uncertain about what Departments will be surrendering, and  there is a legitimate question about how the Executive will be able to balance  their books over the months and years to come. If we are going to use  astronomical terms, we should perhaps talk about a quasar, where a little light  comes out at the end of a tunnel, rather than a black hole, which sucks up  everything.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the short term, although we must accept the limitations  of monitoring rounds, a lot of the focus will now shift to the June monitoring  round to see what the Executive can do. Following the Chancellor&rsquo;s Budget in  April, &pound;116 million in Barnett consequentials will flow into Northern Ireland  over the next two years. Those consequentials have arisen due to the fact that  the Government made the decision, at a UK-wide level, that they still need to  invest to deal with the downturn and to prepare for recovery. That should give  a very clear hint as to what we should be doing in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At the same time, we are faced with finding &pound;123 million in  efficiency savings over the next two years. There will be a very strong  temptation for the Executive to set one sum off against the other. Rather than  taking the opportunity of spending &pound;116 million to help our economy, we may simply  use it to balance the books without trying to change the way that we do things  in Northern Ireland.  If that were to happen, it would be a tremendous shame and a wasted  opportunity. It would show a lack of creativity and imagination on the part of  the Executive. Two weeks ago, the Finance Minister indicated that he was minded  to do that with those figures. That is disappointing. Although I recognise that  under devolution, it is fully up to the Executive to do with those  consequentials as they see fit &mdash; and I defend that right strongly &mdash; equally,  there is a responsibility to ensure that we spend that money wisely.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Overall, the scale of the stimulus in Northern Ireland  has been extremely small; it is barely 1% to 2% of the more than &pound;8 billion  departmental expenditure limit. That pales into insignificance when compared  with stimulus elsewhere in the UK.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are in a situation in which there are looming efficiency  savings in the longer term. There is no doubt that Mr McNarry and his new party  colleagues will be doing their utmost to ensure that Northern Ireland is spared the  worst. However, we wait to see whether that will be the case. There is a wider  debate taking place at UK  level about when to turn off the tap with regard to Keynesian stimulus. Should  one keep going, or if there are sufficient indicators of the green shoots of  recovery, should one turn off the tap and recognise the looming difficulties of  the debt burden that will have to be borne? I do not see any evidence that  detailed and strategic economic discussion is taking place in Northern Ireland  about whether we should be spending money now or holding back for a rainy day,  which is disappointing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister challenged Members to state where savings can  be made. First, we must be careful of going  down the populist route: it is very easy to do so and receive easy  plaudits. There is a need for responsibility in Government. I would hate to see  the situation arise in which populism were pursued until the elections in 2011,  with pain following thereafter. That is not the responsible thing to do for the  people of Northern Ireland,  who are more sophisticated.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The second issue relates to the cost of division. We have  tabled proposals to the Executive on that matter, and I may take an opportunity  to discuss them in greater detail tomorrow. I note that a Sinn F&eacute;in Member was  talking about shared services around the border. Although I respect  constitutional appropriateness, my party and I are happy to explore that theme  in much greater detail, because that is the constructive approach.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member draw his remarks to a close?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Equally, Sinn F&eacute;in should consider our proposals for dealing with division in Northern Ireland  and its financial consequences. I look forward to that discussion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I am pleased to contribute to the debate. This is the third year in which the  Assembly has entered into the process. Many have stated their dislike for the  process, but at least we are engaged in one. Regardless of one&rsquo;s perspective, we  can all acknowledge that it is much more positive to have our own devolved  Assembly in which people who are directly elected by the Northern Ireland  electorate can contribute and make their points. If people disagree with the  direction that the Executive are taking on public finance matters, they can air  their views, which will be listened to and, from time to time, adopted. It is  positive that we are debating the Supply resolution and that it is not being  foisted upon us without any direct local input.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will respond to some comments and try to make some of my  own. I am instinctively drawn to Mr McNarry&rsquo;s comments first. In the same way  that he sought an apology from the Finance Minister for not attending today&rsquo;s  debate, Mr McNarry should apologise to the House for being here. He ran through  a reheated ramble that, sadly, we have had to listen to time and again.  However, he did make some new mistakes:  he claimed that no new bids were being submitted by Departments in the upcoming  monitoring round, which is incorrect. I am a member of the Finance and  Personnel Committee and the Enterprise,  Trade and Investment Committee, and I recall that during meetings of both  Committees, departmental officials had submissions for the monitoring round.  The Finance Department submitted bids for the monitoring round: what the  Executive choose to do with those bids is a matter for them, but it is  completely erroneous to say that no bids are being submitted.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We also heard the old chestnut about rewriting the Budget  and Programme for Government: it is really time for the rewriting of speeches.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Whenever Mr McNarry calls for the Programme for Government  to be rewritten, I am reminded of that now-famous comment from his party  leader, the Minister for Employment and Learning, who when asked on the BBC&rsquo;s  &lsquo;Politics Show&rsquo; whether it should be rewritten, said &ldquo;no, not at all&rdquo;. Instead  of trying to bring that idea to the House to persuade the rest of us, Mr  McNarry would have a good job trying to persuade the leader of his own party of  the merits of that argument.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">1.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Other Members touched on the issue of monitoring rounds.  The Budget, or the financial position, is not in any way static: it does  change. Sometimes, it can be limited in its quantum and scope. However, if we  are looking for a rapid response to an issue, the monitoring round process can deliver.  It is completely and utterly wrong to say that nothing has happened since  devolution. I believe that about &pound;1 billion worth of resources have been  re-allocated as a result of the monitoring round process since these  institutions were re-established two years ago. Furthermore, &pound;1 billion is not  an insubstantial amount in any respect; it is a sizeable sum, which the  monitoring round process has allowed to be moved to areas where it can be spent  effectively.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I listened intently to Dr Farry&rsquo;s remarks about the June  monitoring round and the impact of the Barnett consequentials. He made an  interesting case, and it is worth examining how we deal with that impact.  Obviously, none of the Executive is contemplating that, but there is, perhaps,  an argument in doing as he suggests, rather than just offsetting the additional  money received against that which we lose. Perhaps we could examine how, even  within Departments that would be losing that money, it could be reprioritised  and retargeted, particularly for use as an economic stimulus. There is merit in  that argument.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, we saw recently that we do not need even the  monitoring round process to deliver impact and benefit in the economic  downturn. The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment announced in the  House recently a &pound;15 million short-term aid scheme to help businesses, and the  Minister for Employment and Learning announced the Skillsafe initiative, which  is aimed particularly at apprentices. Those initiatives emerged without the  need for a monitoring round or a formal Budget process. There was a  reprioritisation within existing allocations to help those who are in need in  this difficult economic climate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When one hears talk about reprioritising the Budget,  particularly from the Ulster Unionist Party, it would be interesting and useful  if that party came forward with its own suggestions.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  At least we are here to do it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I hear nothing at this stage; I hear only calls about reprioritising, but  nothing about from where. There are lots of demands for more money for this and  for that, but the flipside of that equation &mdash; the downside, the nasty side &mdash;  namely, from where money would be taken, is something about which the Ulster  Unionist Party is silent.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have to at least acknowledge the SDLP&rsquo;s contribution. I  might not agree entirely with some of its suggestions, such as felling an  eighth of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  forests, or the idea that some of the money in Invest Northern Ireland or the  Harbour Commissioners&rsquo; resources, capital reserves or current cash reserves may  be entirely accessible. At the same time, I do not believe that some of the  very good ideas that the SDLP has about selling off some assets might be  realisable at the levels that it suggests or at this time. However, the SDLP  has at least made a valuable and useful contribution.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Dr Farry made a similar contribution for the Alliance  Party. I will not say that I am looking forward to his contribution tomorrow,  but I will certainly listen to it intently. However, at least that quarter is  also making suggestions about what could be done. We can examine those, and the  Executive and Departments could take some meritorious points from them and take  them forward. However, the Ulster Unionist Party is curiously silent when it  comes to making suggestions as to what can be done. Indeed, in the Executive,  Mr McNarry&rsquo;s party colleagues agree, and have agreed, to what is going on. In  fact, they initiated some of the very changes about which we spoke earlier.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Again, we had the re-appearance of the mysterious black  hole. Dr Farry is correct in his assessment that many of the figures are simply  aspirational. There are many things in the so-called back hole that it would be  nice to deliver, and there are many ideas, policies and initiatives that it  would be nice to implement. However, they were simply not as pressing or as  likely to be realised as other matters.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I recall Mr McNarry saying some months ago that the  Executive would overspend in the previous financial year. However, the  provisional out-turn figures, which are due before the end of the month, will  show that claim to have been nonsense.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Similarly, Mr McNarry&rsquo;s assessment that there is a black  hole is nonsense. It is apparent that one thing that has fallen into a black  hole is Mr McNarry&rsquo;s short-term memory. He said that nothing was being done on  the review of senior civil servants&rsquo; pay and bonuses. However, only last  Thursday, the Minister of Finance and Personnel announced his intention to  establish an independent review of senior civil servants&rsquo; pay and bonuses.  Therefore, Mr McNarry appears to be asleep at the wheel in that respect.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In discussions about what will happen in the next spending  round, we are continually reminded by Mr McNarry and his colleagues that the  next Government are likely to be Conservative. Things are bad now, but I am  absolutely certain that, under the Conservative Party&rsquo;s power &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  You can vote Labour then.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I always vote for the DUP in a general election, and I will continue to do  that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Times are difficult, and Labour has shown its true colours  by cutting and slashing away at budgets. However, one thing that is absolutely  certain is that the Conservatives would be in no way better; in many respects,  they would be much worse. There were revelations last week that the  Conservatives would make 10% cuts to all Departments except health.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is incumbent on the Ulster Unionist Party, which extols  the virtues of its link with the Conservative Party, to explain how the people  of Northern Ireland  would benefit from a 10% cut in our public expenditure. The people of Northern Ireland  will find it very difficult to see the benefit of that. Northern Ireland is experiencing difficult  times, but it will be absolutely savaged by cuts if the Tories win the next Westminster election.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Member to draw his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  It is incumbent on that party to come forward and tell us &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  No; I am clearly running out of time.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That party must tell us exactly what it will do to protect Northern Ireland from the savage cuts that the  Tories are going to make across Whitehall  and the United Kingdom Government.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle agus a chairde.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">An issue that continues to make the headlines is the  provision of housing, as does the issue of housing in general. The SDLP may  well laugh, but the lack of available resources for housing is a matter of  great concern to those of us who sit on the Committee for Social Development,  particularly given the collapse of house and land sales.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We constantly hear about rising waiting lists &mdash; the latest  figure is around 40,000 &mdash; and rising homelessness. The Minister of Finance and  Personnel needs to take that into account when dealing with the Budget. It is  essential that housing is provided to the people who are most in need in our  society. That provision is a cross-cutting issue that impacts on people&rsquo;s  education, health, employment and development in their community. Therefore, we  have an obligation to ensure that resources are made available to deal with the  issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mike Smyth&rsquo;s report, which was launched last week, is a  welcome addition to the housing debate. That report states that a well-funded  social housing programme would impact on the hard-pressed construction  industry. However, it must be noted that it was the collapse of the  private-housing market that had the biggest impact on the construction  industry. In 2003-04, more than 93% of all housing &mdash; some 13,900 housing units  &mdash; was built for the private sector.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for Social Development has supported, and  will continue to support, the calls for more resources to be made available for  housing, whether through the Budget&rsquo;s Main Estimates or through monitoring  rounds. There is an argument that all types of housing need to be provided, not  only social-newbuild housing. We must ensure that our housing stock&rsquo;s  infrastructure is maintained. We must ensure that whatever Budget we are  awarded reflects the different aspects of housing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, that has not happened. Failing to include  improvement grants, replacement programmes and cyclical maintenance in the  overall housing strategy is short-sighted, and such an approach has a knock-on  effect on the building industry. Unless the budget is revisited by the Minister  for Social Development or additional resources are found, people who survive on  Egan contracts or maintenance contracts, including those for repairs grants,  will have to lay off many hundreds of people. That would have a knock-on effect  on the entire local economy. Something needs to be done quickly, and I urge the  Minister of Finance and Personnel to take that on board.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I would also like to make a couple of suggestions, one of  which is to do with providing resources from the June monitoring round. Can the  Minister stipulate that additional money will be reserved for all aspects of  maintenance and repairs, including adaptations? Furthermore, will the Minister  of Finance and Personnel consider allowing the Minister for Social Development  to move the &pound;110 million from the delayed Belfast Royal Exchange development  project to cover the reduction in money for Egan contracts and all other  aspects of maintenance?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I remind the Minister for Social Development that she is  the Minister for Social Development and not just the Minister for housing  provision. She needs to deal with all aspects of housing, including urban  regeneration, social security and the community sector, which feels that it is  being ignored when it comes to the Department&rsquo;s budget allocations. She needs  to address all the issues for which she has departmental responsibility as a  matter of urgency.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  I am glad that we have devolution in Northern Ireland and that we as an  Assembly have the opportunity to deal with issues concerning the Budget, rather  than having decisions about financial matters imposed on us without any input  from local politicians. Therefore, I welcome today&rsquo;s debate. However, we must  face up to the reality that, whatever the Budget, only a certain amount of  money can be allocated, and if money is to be moved from one Department to  another, it is a fact that one Department&rsquo;s gain will be another Department&rsquo;s pain.  People who make unending demands for additional resources for their chosen  Department and who seem to be almost insatiable in that regard must face up to  the fact that if their demands are met, others will face substantial cuts. Therefore,  we need to have a sense of realism in facing up to our responsibility.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to focus on one aspect of government, which relates  to sport and culture. Those are areas of great importance, yet they are  undervalued and under&shy;estimated in some sectors. In spite of all the financial  pressures, one area of future economic growth in Northern Ireland is tourism. It is  particularly important at a time when there is a lot of pressure on the economy  and there are financial difficulties across the world.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The growing number of tourists coming to Northern Ireland  over recent years is a continuing trend. Northern Ireland continues to be an  increasingly popular tourist destination. However, if we are to meet the needs  of tourists and attract them back again and again, we need to ensure that we  provide an adequate product that will draw them here initially. Although that  is primarily an issue for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment,  the Tourist Board and Tourism Ireland,  the field of culture, arts and leisure has a major contribution to make in that  regard.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the fact that the work on the upgrading of the Ulster Museum  is almost completed, and there are developments planned with regard to the  Ulster Folk and Transport Museum at Cultra and the Ulster American   Folk Park  at Omagh. However, that must be seen as simply the first stage in the  development of our museums sector. Some good work was done on the development  of a strategy for that sector, and the Department is taking that forward.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  I know what the Member is going to say, but I will give way.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>:  Does the Member agree that more attention should be given to the development of  maritime heritage in Northern    Ireland?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  There is a certain predictability with some of us, and I agree with that  predictability entirely, because I was just about to come to that very point. Northern Ireland  has a tremendous shipbuilding heritage and maritime history, and that needs to  be developed. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span> I will ignore the  comments from my colleague on the right. That sector of the museum world needs  to be developed, and I fully support the Member&rsquo;s comments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In fact, when the Committee was working on the subject of  museums, maritime museums were brought up again and again as being of great  importance.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, museums are only one sector, and the needs of  sports must also be considered. The safety of sports grounds presents a major  challenge. I hope that not only will the money currently focused on that area  continue to be provided, but that a little additional money may be obtained.  Over the years, the necessary investment has not been made in sports grounds  right across Northern Ireland, with the result that many fall below the standard  of safety that is desirable &mdash; indeed, essential &mdash; for the good of spectators.  Therefore, the safety of sports grounds must feature strongly in the Assembly&rsquo;s  financial planning, alongside the issue of stadium development.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  Before leaving the subject of museums, does the Member agree that Northern Ireland  is entitled to a sports museum? Throughout the ages, Northern Ireland has produced a  great many sportsmen and sportswomen, and a sports museum would be highly  attractive to tourists.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  I thank the Member for his intervention. I agree that Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  rich sporting heritage should feature in the museum sector. How that will be  done is a matter for consideration in the context of the strategy for museums,  but sports should not be ignored. Northern Ireland has a number of  sportspeople of world renown.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The reports that have been produced on the state of sports  grounds give genuine cause for concern. Therefore, investment in that area  should be encouraged. Sport does not merely have the general benefit of  improving and enhancing the quality of life; it can contribute substantially to  young people&rsquo;s good health. I am holding my stomach in as I say that this  country has an obesity problem. It is, therefore, good to encourage young people,  and those of us who are slightly older, to become involved in sport. Such  increased involvement would, undoubtedly, improve the standard of health right  across society and result in savings in the health budget. We should not simply  regard culture and sports as separate entities to be examined in isolation.  They benefit all society, through the economic development of tourism,  improving health, and enhancing physical and mental well-being.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It was noted earlier that, although a certain amount of  money will be allocated to Northern    Ireland, ultimately, we are dependent on the  Westminster Exchequer. My colleague Simon Hamilton pointed out what will happen  whatever is the outcome of a future Westminster  election. All the evidence shows that under a Conservative Government, which is  a distinct possibility at present, the financial situation in Northern Ireland  will become even more stringent. We must keep that to the forefront of our  minds as we move towards that election.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Once again, the Assembly finds itself debating Northern Ireland&rsquo;s Budget. Although  today&rsquo;s and tomorrow&rsquo;s motions on the Budget are largely technical in content,  they provide another opportunity to take stock of our collective position in  the middle of an economic crisis.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I join other Members in seeking an explanation of the  Minister of Finance and Personnel&rsquo;s absence and his failure to deliver the  Budget on behalf of his Department. That is one of the annual duties for which  he earns some &pound;54,000 a year, or over &pound;1,000 a week, in a part-time role. He  may have a valid and genuine reason for not being here, but surely Members  should be made aware of what that is.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is without any joy that I acknowledge that we seem,  unfortunately, to be largely in the same position as we were after the February  2009 and December 2008 monitoring rounds. We are still balancing the books, as  opposed to taking any decisive action to ease Northern Ireland out of the  recession and place it in a strong position to compete in the future. It ought  to be acknowledged that very little flexibility is available through in-year  monitoring.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There has been much debate over the past year as to the  existence of a hole in the Northern Ireland Budget. Perhaps we have been  looking at that issue from the wrong angle. Northern Ireland is unlikely to go  bust, as almost happened to some of our banks. Despite the unprecedented level  of debt in which Gordon Brown has placed Northern   Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom, we will, hopefully,  remain solvent.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, our immediate aspirations and much of our  Programme for Government are going or have gone bust. The public&rsquo;s belief in  these institutions, in the lead parties that direct them and, most worryingly,  in politicians in general, has been lost. Retaining the status quo of a Budget  that was agreed two years ago does not give the public great confidence.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will explain further. We are all aware that there has  been a reduction of &pound;133 million in the block grant for 2010-11. How will that  be accounted for in the future? We must start to think about that now.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: Mr  Hamilton did not give way to me earlier. Therefore, I will not give way.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">How is the Northern Ireland Civil Service pay claim, which  some estimates put at more than &pound;100 million &mdash; perhaps &pound;200 million or &pound;300  million &mdash; dealt with in this Budget? There is also the Workplace 2010 debacle.  As has been said, much of the Civil Service has substandard accommodation.  There has been the miscalculation of the value of the Crossnacreevy site by the  Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) and by DFP, which had to  accept that valuation. There is the loss of rates income by Land and Property  Services, another DFP agency that is generating costs and reducing income through  its gross failure to run an efficient rates collection system. A further &pound;236  million of costs will accrue to the Executive as a result of the further  deferment of water charges until after 2011, as suggested by Minister for  Regional Development, Conor Murphy, and the Minister of Finance and Personnel,  Nigel Dodds.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In light of those realities, and amid repeated calls from  these Benches to take action &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  No, I will not give way, for reasons that I explained earlier. The Member will  have his opportunity to speak.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amid repeated calls from these Benches to reprioritise the  Budget in order to make what we have work better for Northern Ireland, the Minister  of Finance and Personnel and the two main parties in the Office of the First  Minister and deputy First Minister have refused to do anything. Is that because  they cannot agree on what action to take?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Earlier in the debate, the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, on behalf  of the Minister of Finance and Personnel, advocated the use of monitoring  rounds for reallocation. I recall that last June there was no reallocation  whatsoever. Will the Minister indicate now what moneys she expects to be reallocated  in this year&rsquo;s June monitoring round? On the other hand, is the Minister being  disingenuous by pointing Members towards a monitoring system that may not  materialise?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is continually claimed that the core of the Programme  for Government was written for economic growth. However, unless one has been  living on Mars for the past year, it is perfectly clear that, rather than  economic growth, Northern    Ireland has been experiencing growing  unemployment. When the circumstances in which a plan is made change, surely the  plan must adapt to that change.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Recent reports of &ldquo;green shoots&rdquo; are welcome, but do not  hide the fact that job losses are still increasing and that job security is  diminishing in many areas across Northern Ireland. I noticed during  the past few days that the Institute   of Directors forecasts  that it may be next January or early in 2010 before the real &ldquo;green shoots&rdquo;  appear. Only last week, like other Committee witnesses, Mike Smyth and Dr Mark  Bailey from the University of Ulster indicated in their aptly entitled paper,  &lsquo;The Case for Increased Investment in  Social Housing: June 2009&rsquo;, the economic and job-creating benefits of  investing in building social housing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, largely due to a reduction in capital receipts  received by her Department, the Minister for Social Development is facing a  hole of &pound;100 million in her housing budget. Setting aside the issue of social  housing, the Assembly and Executive have been slow to react to areas of  potential economic growth, such as green technologies and the wider economic  potential that exists in tackling climate change. The Minister of the  Environment, of course, does not believe that anything can be done about  climate change, because man has nothing to do with it. How ridiculous.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Programme for Government is focused on attracting  foreign direct investment while our small businesses are struggling to get  funding from the banks. Suggested programmes in that area must be welcomed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although financial and budgetary decisions take a while to  filter down to the public, they undoubtedly have an impact, and the fact that  we are, yet again, having a no-change Budget will further diminish the public&rsquo;s  belief in the ability of politics to change things. Instead, the public appear  to be focused on the observations and revelations about MPs&rsquo; expenses. As  people struggle with their own finances, they become increasingly aware of  double-jobbing MPs, who receive MLAs&rsquo;, ministerial, Committee Chairpersons&rsquo; and  Deputy Chairpersons&rsquo; salaries. That creates public dissatisfaction and a  disconnection from politics. Public confidence is necessary if we are to change  policies and budgets to meet people&rsquo;s needs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">MPs cannot be in Westminster  and Stormont at the same time. Double-jobbing costs the public purse and, more  importantly, there are bound to be other impacts. Obviously, double-jobbing  means that we do not have full-time Ministers, and not being present in  Departments for the required length of time undoubtedly has an impact on the  decisions that are made. Following pressure from David Cameron, the DUP was  forced to end its practice of double-jobbing, and the people of Northern Ireland  showed their disgust in the European elections.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Recently, the Finance Minister announced that he is to  commission an independent review of pay and bonuses for senior civil servants  in Northern Ireland.  I have no problem with that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  That is to be welcomed, but perhaps that Minister should begin by adding up the  total salary and expenses that he earns from his North   Belfast constituency &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. On a number of occasions, Members have requested that Mr  Beggs give way. He has made it quite clear that he is not going to give way.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  draw the Deputy Speaker&rsquo;s attention to the clock, which continues to run, so I  hope that he will be lenient when it comes to the end of my time.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Those are issues that ought to be addressed. Rather than  pointing the finger at others, let us set an example.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The huge debt that Gordon Brown has handed to the United Kingdom  has been highlighted. Therefore, regardless of whether there is a Conservative  or Labour Government, that debt will have to be paid. The failure of DUP  Members to acknowledge that fact is quite surprising. Indeed, when talking  about the Assembly Budget, Nelson McCausland said that Members will have to  face up to a new reality. That is not the message that was being delivered when  the DUP was talking about the prospects of future funding for the Assembly from  Westminster. We  will all have to face up to difficulties in the future, irrespective of who  occupies Number 10.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is accepted by all parties that, to date, the devolved  institutions &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member should draw his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  The outcome of the European elections has demonstrated the public&rsquo;s  dissatisfaction with how things have been run in Northern Ireland, how the DUP  and Sinn F&eacute;in have dealt with economic problems, and their lack of ability to  instigate change in the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>: I  rise primarily to contribute on health matters. The National Health Service has  delivered major improvements, particularly in recent years. Investment has  trebled, and the positive impact of that can be seen in the welcome reduction  in waiting lists, and in the increasing number of healthcare staff. In Northern Ireland,  approximately 100,000 people are employed in the National Health Service, and  that includes a significant increase in the number of doctors. Furthermore, some  good initiatives have been embedded in practice.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, there are still many concerns. The media picked up  on the Northern Ireland Audit Office&rsquo;s report into the health and social care  sector, which highlighted the &pound;16 million that has already been spent on  compensating senior staff for the loss of their jobs as a consequence of  reducing the number of trusts from 18 to five. In addition, a further &pound;90  million has been set aside to meet the total early retirement and redundancy  costs that will arise under the review of public administration.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That commitment of &pound;106 million is front-loaded in  anticipation of future substantial savings to the public purse as a result of  the amalgamation of the trusts. Those savings must be delivered, and they must  be quantified as having been delivered.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some senior staff who have been let go are in final salary  schemes and on salaries that are very generous by Northern Ireland standards. We must  ensure that the interests of lower-paid staff in the trusts are as well  protected as those of top management. People should not retire on generous  packages and then pop up almost immediately in quangos or posts that should be  available for people who are appropriately qualified and need the job. The  Minister of Finance and Personnel should take another look at his &mdash; or, indeed,  her &mdash; proposals because we are in a much changed financial environment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are also many concerns that the investment in the  National Health Service does not always afford adequate front line services  where they are most needed and that resources are being spent on expensive  managers and agency staff rather than on permanent posts. We in the SDLP  propose protecting front line services. In our &lsquo;New Priorities in Difficult  Times&rsquo; paper, we outline the need to ensure that we retain the 700-plus nursing  jobs that the Minister has proposed to cut. I understand that the Minister has  reassured the Royal College of Nursing that that will not be the case, and I  hope that that is so. I will certainly watch that space.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There needs to be far more transparency and openness  regarding performance and outcomes. Now that the trusts have been reduced and  structures have been reformed, there will, hopefully, be no more changes for  some time. We have to make the new system work better than the previous one.  People are far more concerned about outcomes and quality, which is where the  focus needs to be.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are very concerned about the pressures on midwifery  services across the North. We want the best possible start for babies and the  best circumstances for mothers. I regularly meet former colleagues &mdash; doctors,  nurses and midwives &mdash; who are deeply concerned about issues in the Royal Jubilee   Maternity Hospital,  primarily around staff shortages and overcrowding. Morale is sometimes low  among staff because they feel that they cannot do the best possible job for  their patients. They are worried about patient safety being compromised. I  would be very interested to hear what consideration the Executive have given to  our proposals, which would certainly ensure that early intervention is put into  practice. They would also bring valuable jobs to an area that has been hit hard  by job losses in the construction industry. Last month, the Royal Institution  of Chartered Surveyors highlighted that the plunge in activity in the  construction industry shows no signs of changing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Despite many assurances that the recommendations of the  Bamford Review of Mental Health and Learning Disability will be implemented,  the low level of available resources for mental-health services, especially for  the next few years, has seen many improvements put on the long finger. The  delay in the implementation of key changes to services to support people with  mental-health issues and/or learning disabilities is very concerning. There are  old buildings that need to be replaced, but we cannot afford to close them  until we have new buildings. People who leave care should also be provided with  more appropriate supported housing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There must be real partnership between Departments in all  areas. There needs to be far more transparency and openness regarding  expenditure, performance and outcomes. There must be a tightening of belts all  round. As I have said, there should be far more focus on positive outcomes and  a far more action-orientated approach.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We know from the Royal College of Nursing that there is a  continuing reduction in the number of specialist nursing posts and a tendency  to place inappropriate and unpaid leadership responsibilities on band 5 and  band 6 registered nurses, which is unsafe practice. The number of trained  mental-health nurses needs to be further increased to meet the needs in  hospitals and the community. Although we welcome the increased number of  midwives being trained this year, that increase needs to be repeated for  several years to achieve an adequate number of trained midwives and to allow  for wastage and increased birth rates in some areas.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In its &lsquo;New Priorities in Difficult Times&rsquo; discussion  paper, the SDLP identified ways in which money can be found to protect front  line services. Saving money cannot simply be about taking a slash and burn  approach to public spending in an effort to balance the books. The Department  of Finance and Personnel can and should do more to support Departments in  making efficiency savings. A Department with a huge number of staff, it could  take more time to study the absolute financial detail. It is also the  Department that has responsibility for personnel &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>:  Yes; I will.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Does the Member agree that, for those of us who sit on and who chair  Committees, it would be very useful, in the interests of transparency and  efficiency, to obtain the details of the monitoring rounds on time? One of the  problems last week was that the Committee for the Environment did not have  access to that detail to discuss it at what was a fairly late stage.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>: I  thank the Member for his intervention. It is absolutely essential that we get the  details of the monitoring rounds on time. It is important that we get far more  financial detail to all Departments to help them make efficiency savings so  that a slash and burn approach is not adopted, resulting in the loss of  important front line services.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">People who work in Departments are also affected. It is not  Whitehall but a  very small, local area. We must make a difference, because that is what  devolution is supposed to be about.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question Time commences at 2.30 pm, so I suggest that the House  take its ease until then. The debate will continue after Question Time, when  the next Member to speak will be Ms Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n.</p>

    <p class="B3BodyText">As Members know, the Programme for Government sets out a  clear statement of the Executive&rsquo;s priorities, and we have already delivered  significant successes across a range of areas, from investment in  infrastructure to the appointment of commissioners and advocates for victims,  children and older people, and from reforms in public services to delivering  support to local people and businesses in the face of the economic downturn. It  is clear that the delivery of the Programme for Government generates real,  tangible benefits for the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On 5 March 2009, the Executive finalised the formal  delivery framework for the Programme for Government. Structures and processes  have been established across Departments to monitor and report on performance.  A key element of the framework is the preparation of delivery reports, which  set out progress made against the programme&rsquo;s key goals, commitments and  targets.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On 7 May 2009, the Executive commissioned the preparation  of a formal delivery report to show progress as at 31 March 2009. That report  is scheduled for consideration at the Executive meeting on 25 June. We hope  that it will be made available to the Committee for the Office of the First  Minister and deputy First Minister for consideration before the summer recess.  That will mark the first step in a wider consultation on the Programme for  Government.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hilditch</strong>:  I thank the First Minister for his answer. However, equally importantly, will  he tell the House what structures exist in Departments to monitor their  performance?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: As a first step, a lead Minister and a senior official have been  assigned to each target and commitment in the Programme for Government.  Therefore, a person has been identified as being responsible for answering for  each of the key goals. In addition, a small number of those key indicators will  be identified to assess whether the delivery of the key goals and commitments  is bringing about the real change that the Programme for Government envisaged.  That assessment will carry on.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Each Department assesses where it stands on meeting those  key goals through a traffic-light system whereby progress is identified as red,  amber &mdash; an amber/green category has crept in &mdash; or green. Therefore, we know  whether people are meeting their targets in each Department. Those results will  be gathered in a delivery report, which will come to the Office of the First  Minister and deputy First Minister (OFMDFM) and will be monitored by my  officials. The Executive, in their periodic meetings, will also look at those  reports and I imagine that, at that stage, Committees will wish to examine how  their Departments are meeting their targets.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that the requirement for progress to be monitored at  every level in each Department, the Executive&rsquo;s oversight and the pressure  exerted by departmental Committees will combine to encourage Departments to  meet those targets. At the very least, that scrutiny will allow us to see where  we are falling behind and, therefore, where more energy, or even resources, may  be required to meet those targets.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. It is useful to get an update on  progress that has been made to date on the Programme for Government. Will the  Minister tell the House what progress has been made to date on meeting the  targets to reduce child poverty?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I am not sure whether I should use the template that we have,  because, as my ministerial colleagues know, it was an indicative report that  was produced for the Executive, from which we took each of the responsibilities  in the Programme for Government and worked them up. However, when the findings  were brought to the Executive, some Ministers felt that they had performed  slightly better than the targets that appeared in the report. Nevertheless, at  least it set us on our way, in that we could begin to determine targets  properly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The deputy First Minister and I have had several meetings  with officials and ministerial colleagues on the whole issue of poverty, and we  have identified four different methods to measure poverty. In my view, the one  that is the most accurate is the absolute measurement, and, on that basis, we  are meeting our targets.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Relative indictors require us to consider how we compare  with other parts of Europe, so we will be able  to provide the Committee with a full range of measurements, using different  measuring techniques. However, measurements indicate that Northern Ireland  is making progress beyond that which it did in the past. Nevertheless, we still  lag behind other parts of Europe, and we all  know, especially in these difficult times of an economic recession, that the  greatest pressures fall on those who are less well off. Therefore, it is more  difficult to meet the targets, and a greater onus is placed on us to ensure  that we put in place the necessary steps to enable us to meet them.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: In  recent weeks, a number of Ministers have indicated that some of the issues that  they bring to the Executive in line with the Programme for Government are being  held up there. Indeed, there is some frustration that some issues are not being  brought to the Executive table from the First Minister&rsquo;s office. In broad-brush  terms, and using his own red/amber/green scales, how does the First Minister  rate the performance of the Executive and his office?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I use red, white and blue ones.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We all need to be honest about the general issues at stake.  When the Member for East Belfast and her colleague the Committee Chairperson  came to see the deputy First Minister and me last week, I said that if the  deputy First Minister were left on his own in OFMDFM, decisions would be taken  much quicker, and if I were left on my own, decisions would be taken much  quicker. However, our system of government requires us to go through a process  of getting agreement so that we have the highest level of agreement possible on  a range of issues. We must face up to the fact that the system is slow, and  that is why some of us want to see the system modified and improved.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Bearing in mind the difficult terrain in which we must  work, the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister is performing  very well and getting things done &mdash; much better certainly than its predecessor,  where a series of collapses and huffs took place. At least we are doing the  business, slow though it may be at times. The more that we deal with issues  that present a win-win situation for all sections of our community, the faster  those issues will make progress.</p>
    <p class="H5StageHeading">Climate Change: Sustainable Development Strategy</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr Cobain </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister what its  position is on climate change in relation to its sustainable development  strategy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2952/09>(AQO 2952/09)</a></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: Our position on climate change is consistent with that set out in  the Programme for Government, which acknowledges that climate change is a most  serious problem.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Members of the Executive, we remain determined to play  our part in addressing the challenges that climate change presents, whether  they be environmental, social or economic.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Day and daily, Departments across Northern Ireland  are progressing plans and strategies that will ultimately contribute to a  reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions and combat the worst effects of climate  change. For example, the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development has  identified sustainability as a key factor in developing its new rural White  Paper; the Department for Regional Development is working on initiatives that  support sustainable transport; and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment is leading in the area of renewable energy. Those actions will have  telling and lasting effects.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Ministers of the Department with responsibility for  sustainable development policy, the deputy First Minister and I face the challenge  of mobilising all those plans and strategies to achieve the maximum effect, and  our new sustainable development strategy and, importantly, the associated  implementation plan, will have a leading role to play. We intend to produce a  high-level strategy to enable and support those Departments whose work supports  the fight against climate change. The implementation plan will express, clearly  and accountably, the way in which that will be done, after we have listened to  the views of stakeholders.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cobain</strong>:  The First Minister, through his reply, has answered most of my supplementary  question. The purpose of the current development strategy is to mainstream the  policies into each Department. Will the First Minister reassure the House that  that is actually the case?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I assure the Member of that. Although the deputy First Minister  and I play a co-ordinating role, much of the action on the ground will be taken  by Ministers and their Departments. It is hard to think of any Department that  will not make some contribution, and although I have mentioned three, I could  easily have mentioned others. Each Minister recognises his or her  responsibility in relation to climate change. It is a key issue and target in  our Programme for Government. Therefore, it is our responsibility to take it  forward.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle agus a Aire. Does the Minister  believe that the Environment Minister&rsquo;s position on climate change is  sustainable?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: Everyone knows that the Environment Minister does not deny that  climate change exists; indeed, he argues that it has been happening for  centuries. The Environment Minister feels that climate change is not solely due  to the man-made contribution, and it is hard to argue with that viewpoint.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When one examines where the greatest burden lies, the  statistics and the expert views indicate that man has made a very significant  contribution to climate change. However, the causes of climate change and what  might be contributing to it are academic. If it exists, we must deal with it,  and we require policies to do so.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  Does the First Minister agree that the climate change strategy, like any  strategy, must be underpinned by clear targets? Furthermore, given our  tremendous renewable energy resources, does he agree that we should adopt the  EU target of sourcing 15% of our energy from renewable sources by 2020?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: In joint ministerial council meetings, the deputy First Minister  and I have had discussions with the other devolved Ministers and the UK  Government about targets. We have made it clear that Northern   Ireland will contribute to the overall UK targets.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A position often adopted by people here is that Northern Ireland is such a small area of land in  comparison to countries such as China,  India or the USA, and that  we cannot make a great difference. However, climate change is one area in which  every part of the world must make a contribution; Northern Ireland no less so than  any others.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One of the areas that we can examine is relation to sustainability is energy, and in my previous post as Minister of Finance, I very keenly examined all of the renewable energy possibilities, and we can make a very real contribution in that area.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, I am reluctant to get down to what part of the UK target should be met by Northern Ireland. We have committed to making our contribution, and we will make the fullest possible contribution, whether that is below or beyond the target set by the EU. </p>
    <p class="H5StageHeading">Racial Equality Strategy</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Ms Lo </strong>asked  the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister, in the absence of  the cohesion, sharing and integration strategy, if it would consider reviving  the racial equality strategy to require Departments to produce annual action  plans to tackle racism and racial discrimination.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2953/09>(AQO 2953/09)</a></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: The Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister  remains committed to the implementation of the current racial equality strategy  endorsed by the Assembly on 3 July 2007. We certainly consider that the six  shared aims of that strategy remain comprehensive and robust, especially given  the increasing diversity of the population in recent years. Practical work to  improve racial equality and good relations continues to be done as part of the  racial equality strategy. For example, the migrant workers thematic subgroup  continues to operate, and its work has been widely welcomed, including the  migrant workers strategy and action plan.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">While work to fulfil the commitments in the first action  plan to implement the racial equality strategy continues, our resources are now  focused on developing proposals for the programme for cohesion, sharing and  integration. Those proposals will include actions to tackle racism and  sectarianism. While work to finalise the programme for cohesion, sharing and  integration progresses, the work of challenging sectarianism, racism and all  forms of intolerance continues with the active support of OFMDFM Ministers.  That support has been clearly demonstrated since the restoration of devolution  in May 2007.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the Member will be aware, the very first event that the  former First Minister and the deputy First Minister hosted was a reception here  in Parliament Buildings for new and existing minority ethnic communities,  migrant workers, and those who work closely with them. We recognise that real  change takes place on the ground through local people providing local solutions  to local issues. We acknowledge the valuable and vital role played by groups  working with ethnic communities on the ground. In recognition of that, we have  recently announced a further tranche of funding to support work with minority  ethnic people and communities in the financial year 2009-2010.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This year, we have increased the amount of money available  in the fund by 10%, to over &pound;1 million, to meet the increasing demand. That is  on top of a substantial increase last year following devolution. The aims of  the funds align with our Programme for Government commitments by supporting  work that contributes to the promotion of good relations between people of  different ethnic backgrounds, the building of community cohesion, and the  facilitation of integration.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: I  thank the First Minister for his comprehensive answer. Although ethnic minority  communities are very appreciative of the increased funding for their work, they  are anxious that work needs to be carried out in Departments, something that has  not happened in the past two years. Will the First Minister outline what work  has been done by OFMDFM and other Departments on promoting racial equality and  addressing racial discrimination?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: The role that the deputy First Minister and I have in that area  requires us to meet a number of organisations that work with migrant workers  and minority ethnic communities. We encourage that work in our speeches and  statements, to indicate that they have our support and that they continue to do  so. We encourage it through the funding that we give to those organisations  that are best placed, on the ground, to make the change that is necessary.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are a number of schemes in place, some of which, for  instance, take people from our indigenous population to other parts of the  world, such as the site of the Holocaust, so that they can have a better  understanding of the migrant workers who come into Northern Ireland. All of that  helps, but the overall programme for cohesion, sharing and integration will  identify the actions that need to be taken. Considerable work is going into  that, not just on sectarianism, which is our own, home-grown problem, but on  racism and the difficulties with the integration of minority communities.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>: I  thank the First Minister for his detailed, factual and helpful response.  Obviously, to try to tackle racism and racial discrimination, it is important  that there be a possibility, and that we are hopeful, of meeting the targets.  Can the First Minister confirm that the targets are still in place, and that  achievements on cohesion, sharing and integration can be made?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I shall tie that question with the question about the measurement  of targets. In such an area, on-the-ground contacts and communications are  critical. Although it is important to measure the work that is done, to use a  rural expression, you do not fatten a pig by weighing it. The system can have  all sorts of measurements, but it is the real groundwork that can make the  difference. Of course there are targets, and the amount of reported  difficulties has reduced.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The exception was the considerable blip that took place as  a result of the Northern Ireland  v Poland  football game. Some Polish football supporters, who have a worldwide reputation  for their behaviour, left behind a trail that led to innocent Polish people  having various hate crimes committed against them. The Executive want to be  identified as being opposed to all those who might be involved in that kind of  activity, especially when it targets a section of our community that has made a  great contribution to the Northern Ireland economy and to the community as a  whole.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Apart from that blip, the number of hate crimes had been  reducing considerably. None of us should be complacent and write off the fact  that one incident can cause considerable difficulties. We, as Assembly Members,  are required to be actively working on the ground in our constituencies to give  support to those who have been facing any such difficulties.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. In light of the recent, quite  horrific, attacks in Coleraine, what steps are being taken by the Office of the  First Minister and deputy First Minister to tackle sectarianism in Coleraine?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First Minister</strong>:  First, I condemn those attacks. We should not consider that Coleraine is  somehow different from the rest of the Province and that Coleraine is the  problem point. There is underlying sectarianism across our community, and it  emanates from all sides of the community. Therefore, it must be tackled in a  comprehensive and robust way.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Immediately after the attack in Coleraine, the deputy First  Minister and I met the police to discuss the investigation. Often, the best way  of tackling such issues is to ensure that prosecutions take place and to ensure  that the courts, using due process, can deal with the incidents concerned. We  also sent a message to the community relations unit, which was fairly quick off  the mark without any prodding &mdash; for want of a better word &mdash; from OFMDFM. The  lasting contribution that OFMDFM can make on such matters is to get our  cohesion, sharing and integration strategy through the Assembly and to have it  in place so that the action plan can be used to work to eliminate sectarianism.</p>
    <p class="H5StageHeading">Presbyterian Mutual Society</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mr  Kennedy </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister  for an update on any discussions it has had with the Prime Minister and HM  Treasury on the Presbyterian Mutual Society.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2954/09>(AQO  2954/09)</a></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: Every Member will be acutely aware of the difficulties that  members of the Presbyterian Mutual Society (PMS) face. When the deputy First  Minister and I met the Prime Minister on 25 February 2009, we took the  opportunity to register our concerns about the PMS situation. After the Prime  Minister received the report on the PMS, he agreed to a further meeting with us  to specifically discuss the matter. That meeting will take place on 17 June. We  have also been in contact with the Secretary of State on the matter.  Furthermore, on 29 April 2009, my colleagues Nigel Dodds and Arlene Foster met  the then Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Yvette Cooper, to discuss the PMS  issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That constructive meeting entailed an exchange of views, as  well as information about the particulars of the PMS situation. Members of the  society have been living with uncertainty as to the state of their savings for  some considerable time. The administrator who is appointed to wind up the  society&rsquo;s affairs has indicated that it would be helpful to know whether the  Government are prepared to offer assistance.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">For those reasons, we are keen that when we meet the Prime  Minister later this week, we can leave with some firm decisions as to his  Government&rsquo;s intentions. The ambiguity of the current situation is harmful and  hurtful, not only to members of the Presbyterian Mutual Society but to the  wider community.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I am grateful to the First Minister for his reply. I declare an interest; I  have a modest sum of money in the Presbyterian Mutual Society. I welcome the  fact that First Minister has indicated the cross-party and cross-community  nature of this issue. All Assembly Members are aware of the acute and severe  financial hardship that a great many find themselves in through no fault of their  own.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Does the First Minister agree that when Gordon Brown tells  the House of Commons that no UK  saver will lose out as a result of the current banking crisis, that guarantee  should extend not only to members and savers of the Dunfermline Building Society  but to those of the Presbyterian Mutual Society?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: As a general principle, we can all support that. He will be aware  that the Government make a distinction between savers and investors. The Prime  Minister has been quick to point out, as was the Secretary of State, that  Presbyterian Mutual Society depositors were investors, rather than savers. I do  not accept that distinction. It was not in the mind of anyone who deposited  funds in the Presbyterian Mutual Society that they were speculating, hoping to  make a quick pound. They were, in every sense, savers. If the Secretary of  State can tell the House of Commons, as he did on 3 June, that bureaucracy  should not stand in the way of doing the right thing, we would all judge him  severely were he to make semantics an obstacle to progress.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I trust that the Prime Minister will recognise the genuine  determination on the part of those who deposited funds in the PMS that they are  on a level playing field with savers in the Equitable Life Assurance Society,  the Dunfermline Building Society and the third mutual society that was reported  to be in difficulty at the weekend. For those reasons, the Government need to  assist the PMS. We will make that case.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We recognise that it would be altogether better, from the  point of view of the depositors, were a bank to take an interest in the PMS  and, therefore, cover it by the guarantees that are available to banks. That is  outside our control, although the Government, who have a stake in several  banks, might like to encourage people to look at that option.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>: I  assure the First Minister and the deputy First Minister that they go into that  meeting with the encouragement and endorsement of all Members.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The First Minister rightly picks up on the false distinction  that the Government make between investors and savers. As he says, those who  saved in the Presbyterian Mutual Society thought of themselves as savers. The  Government cannot have it both ways. They cannot, on the one hand, cite  Financial Services Authority concerns that money was being taken in the form of  deposits, because that is essentially the business of banking, and, on the  other hand, indict the savers as though they were investors.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: You must ask a question.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  Will the First Minister make it clear that several charities are among those  who have invested over the shareholder limit? The Government&rsquo;s suggestion that  they are speculative investors is downright insulting.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: We are happy to do that. I appreciate the Member&rsquo;s comment that  there is overall support around the House for the case that we will take to the  Prime Minister.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, those who invested more than &pound;20,000 with  the Presbyterian Mutual Society are regarded as having provided it with a loan  and, therefore, have first call on any funds that become available. That means  that people who made investments of less than &pound;20,000 will be hurt most. I do  not know the category into which the Member for Newry and Armagh  falls. It means that many people who had put away a nest egg will be unlikely  to get more than 30 pence in the pound for their savings. That is regrettable.  That is the area into which the Prime Minister must look most closely.</p>

    <p class="H4StageHeading">Rural White Paper</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mr  Neeson </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development when the  rural White Paper will be completed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2971/09>(AQO  2971/09)</a></p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">17. <strong>Mr  McCarthy </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development for an  update on the rural White Paper.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2987/09>(AQO  2987/09)</a></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development (Ms Gildernew)</strong>: With your permission, a  LeasCheann Comhairle, I will answer question No 1 and question No 17 together.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased to report that progress continues on  developing the rural White Paper. During coming weeks, I will submit proposals  for a thematic approach to the Executive. The rural White Paper stakeholder  advisory group has commenced work in subgroup format on the five themes that  have been identified in proposals for a thematic approach to the rural White  Paper&rsquo;s development. That work includes looking at issues and challenges that  rural communities face and identifying new approaches to address those  challenges.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is anticipated that that work will be completed by late  autumn 2009, following which the five subgroups will report to the Department  on the outcome of their work. The Department has discussed its proposals for  the rural White Paper with the interdepartmental committee on rural policy and  seeks nominations from other Departments of appropriate officials to  participate in the rural White Paper&rsquo;s development.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is proposed that other Departments will begin to engage  with stakeholders during the subgroup stage. The Department has also considered  options for the establishment of an effective rural evidence base as part of  the rural champion concept and is commissioning papers to help to inform the  rural White Paper. It is proposed that the main work to develop the rural White  Paper will take place during 2009 and into 2010, with public consultation on  the draft document in 2010. That time frame will tie in with the development of  the new comprehensive spending review.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her reply. She was probably not in the Chamber when the  First Minister referred to the role that agriculture can play in mitigating  climate change through renewable energy initiatives. Will the Minister include  firm proposals to expand green energy in the rural White Paper? Can she assure  the House that she will make that a priority?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: If the Member will allow me some  latitude, I am happy to return to that matter when I answer environmental  questions later. Climate change mitigation does not necessarily fit into the  main role of the rural White Paper. The paper aims at ensuring that rural  dwellers&rsquo; entitlement to goods and services is equal to that of urban dwellers  and not merely a tick-box exercise at the end of the policymaking process.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with the First Minister that agriculture has a role  to play in mitigating climate change. I am happy to respond to the Member in  writing on that issue.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span><strong></strong>Can the Minister tell the House what priorities for rural infrastructure  she will include in the rural White Paper? That is, if she heard my question  over the interruption by certain Members</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: The rural White Paper represents a wide  range of rural interests and sets out five themes, which are being considered  in subgroup format. I will come back to the Executive with further detail on  the work on the five themes. I am happy to provide the Member with more details  in writing if that is OK.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: N&aacute; habair &eacute;.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  To date, how much has been spent on producing the rural White Paper? Does the  Minister believe that it represents value for money?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I certainly do believe that the rural  White Paper represents value for money; I would not have brought it forward  otherwise. The fact that the North was without a rural White Paper when the  rest of Ireland had one, as  did England, Scotland and Wales, shows that there is merit in  having one.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We must ensure that rural dwellers are not left out during  policy formulation. As I said, the development of the proposals on the rural  White Paper will take place throughout 2009, and we will produce a more detailed  paper in 2010. That fits in with the comprehensive spending review. It is worth  spending the money to ensure that rural dwellers are not left behind, and it  fits in with the departmental budget. Members will be glad when the rural White  Paper is developed, and I am happy to receive input from Members.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Maith th&uacute;, a Chiar&aacute;in. Caithfidh m&eacute; &eacute; sin a r&aacute;. The SDLP is a long-term proponent of the  rural White Paper. The Minister mentioned that she will engage with  stakeholders during 2009-2010 and hold further widespread public consultation  thereafter. Does the Minister have any indication of when the public  consultation will be complete and, more importantly, when we might be at the  point of having a rural White Paper? Does she have a deadline or specific date  in mind?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Much work has already been done with  stakeholders, and I am pleased that some rural organisations have held  conferences to discuss the rural White Paper. For empowerment purposes, the  rural community needs to say what it wants to see in there. The rural White  Paper stakeholder advisory group represents a broad range of issues, such as  agriculture interests, which are represented by the Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union, the Young Farmers Clubs and NIAPA. It also  represents environmental groups and broader rural organisations such as the  Rural Development Council and the Rural Community Network.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department is formulating a big piece of policy work,  the bones of which I will take to the Executive in the next few weeks. Much  work has already been done. As I have said in the House, a job that is worth  doing is worth doing right. I want to get it right, and I expect firm proposals  to come through this year and be published in 2010. You will see a rural White  Paper in the next 12 months or thereabouts.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Mr Danny Kennedy. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Perseverance and a bad back pay off, apparently. Anyway, will the Minister  inform the House whether the rural White Paper will attempt to improve  co-operation between the farming community and the wider rural community?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: That is not necessarily the job of the  rural White Paper. It aims to improve co-operation between the Department of  Agriculture and Rural Development and other Departments. We need to ensure  that, when other Departments formulate policy, they consider the 40% of the  population who live in rural areas. It is about governmental acceptance of the  needs of the rural community. Every Department plays a part; whether it is  health, education or roads, every Depart&shy;ment has an obligation to meet the  needs of rural dwellers. The rural White Paper will ensure that we are not left  behind during the formulation of those policies.</p>
    <p class="H5StageHeading">Rural Childcare</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Ms S  Ramsey </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development what  progress has been made on the rural childcare strategy and what impact it will  have.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2972/09>(AQO 2972/09)</a></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Shortly after I took office, I initiated  the rural childcare stakeholder group and was pleased to present its report  &lsquo;Rural Childcare: Investing in the Future&rsquo; to the ministerial subcommittee on  children and young people in March 2008. The report contains several  cross-cutting recommendations and recommends that DARD develop a rural  childcare programme. My officials are working with other Departments on the  cross-cutting recommendations for rural childcare as part of the development of  the rural champion concept and the rural White Paper.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am delighted that the rural childcare programme has recently  opened for applications and will be funded by the Department&rsquo;s rural  anti-poverty and social inclusion framework budget. I formally launched the  programme on Tuesday 9 June during a visit to the childcare centre in Eskragh, County Tyrone,  which is an excellent example of a rural community working together for the  good of the entire community.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The programme is worth &pound;1&middot;5 million, and its overall  objective is to improve childcare provision in rural areas by providing  solutions that address the distinct challenges faced by rural communities in relation  to the delivery of and access to childcare services. Through that programme, we  will provide funding to support the development and evaluation of a series of  pilot or demonstration projects. The evidence that is collected will form a  basis for the development of future policy and priorities for rural childcare  provision. By improving information about rural childcare provision, the  programme has the potential to help bring about great improvements in the lives  of women and children who live in rural areas, to support families and to  contribute to the economic and social development of rural areas in the North.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am, therefore, confident that that new and innovative  programme will make a significant contribution to a better future for rural  communities. It will lead to increased opportunities and choices for rural  parents in taking up employment or training and will assist rural development.  The rural childcare programme and the rural childcare stakeholder report  complement other Executive initiatives such as the lifetime opportunities  strategy and the work being carried out by the ministerial subcommittee on  children and young people. It will also inform the development of the early  years strategy for nought-to-six-year-olds.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for her  comprehensive answer. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span> If the children  in the corner settle down, they will get to hear my supplementary question.  Basil is the leader of those children.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to recognise, as I did during questions to  the First Minister and the deputy First Minister, the Minister of Agriculture  and Rural Development&rsquo;s response and approach to the issue of rural childcare.  That is one of the benefits of devolution. Will the Minister outline the  timetable for the rolling-out of the rural childcare programme?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: The rural childcare programme is now  open to applications. The closing date for receipt of applications is 30 June.  Following eligibility checks, appraisals and project site visits, it is  anticipated that assessment panels will sit in September and that letters of  offer will be issued in October and November. All successful projects must be  completed by 31 March 2011. I am pleased to say that we have had more than 130  applications to date. There is a lot of interest in the programme and a lot of  need. I do not know whether it will cover the weans in the corner, but you never  know.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  am aware that, in the past, some rural playgroups were almost forced to close  because numbers temporarily dropped, but within two years they were operating  at capacity again. Will the Minister ensure that the funding mechanism will not  be a case of &ldquo;all or nothing&rdquo; and that it will be responsive? Furthermore, will  she tell the House what sort of money will be available to individual groups  that apply to the rural childcare programme?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: The programme is an ongoing venture. Mr  Beggs is asking about something that comes under the remit of another  Department. However, the money that is available now is for pilot and  demonstration projects. The commitment to those projects is not necessarily  ongoing, but it will help them to get off the ground. The rural childcare  programme&rsquo;s overall budget is &pound;1&middot;5 million, and there may be flexibility in it.  I do not have detailed information on any cap on those projects, but I will be  happy to provide that to the Member in writing. It is important that we help  those groups to get off the ground. Families from rural communities will  benefit from the programme.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The West Tyrone MLAs who are here will know that the  Eskragh childcare centre is a fantastic example of such programmes. I was  invited there by Barry McElduff. There is not even a housing estate in Eskragh,  yet 120 children attend the childcare centre every day of the week. That is an  enormous achievement for a rural community. The parents in that community have  far greater choice than is available to parents in many other areas that do not  have similar programmes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  I warmly welcome the new rural childcare programme. However, what assurances  can the Minister give that no child will be denied such a service because of a  lack of affordability?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Unfortunately, I cannot give the Member  that assurance. I am doing my bit to help strengthen choices for parents who  live in rural areas. I am one of the Ministers who sit on the ministerial  subcommittee on children and young people, and I always make the case for rural  communities. The responsibility for childcare is shared by a number of  Departments, such as the Department for Social Development; therefore, the  responsibility is not mine alone.</p>

    <p class="H5StageHeading">Food Exports</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Mr B  McCrea </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development what  discussions she had with her ministerial colleagues before she called for the  removal of UK status on food  exported from Northern    Ireland.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2973/09>(AQO  2973/09)</a></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>: La question num&eacute;ro trois, Monsieur le Pr&eacute;sident.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I am very impressed at the bilingualism  in the Chamber today; it is brilliant.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have discussed the issue with ministerial colleagues in  my party. However, there is no obligation on me to discuss it with other  Ministers in order that I may express my view. Farmers have raised the issue  with me regularly at a range of meetings and forums.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">So far, we have made excellent progress in keeping out of Ireland serious diseases that have occurred in Britain, for  example, foot-and-mouth disease and bluetongue. Through our fortress Ireland policy,  I intend to do my utmost to ensure that that remains the case. In that context,  our animals having a UK identity can be a disadvantage to our farmers whenever  they are transporting animals abroad, and a clearer local identity can assist  in ensuring that our animals are identified clearly with the better disease  status of the island of their birth. We need to maximise the potential of  selling our produce on the world stage by having a clear clean, green label  that associates our produce with a positive and disease-free status.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In accordance with the country codes laid down by the International  Organization for Standardization, under Council Regulations (EC) 1760/2000 and  21/2004, the identification code on cattle and sheep ear tags must begin with  the letters that identify the member state of origin. However, the concept of  regionalisation is well established and is accepted by the EU Commission. I  intend to press a case for regionalisation on this issue. Obviously, Members on  the opposite Benches are likely to have an ideological objection to that.  However, I ask them to think carefully about the issue and not to have a  knee-jerk reaction to it. I also ask them to consider the potential benefits  and the reality that our industry could capitalise on our recent record of  better disease levels.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  In a global market, food, or its consumption, is one of the few commodities  whose locale concerns the consumer. In the agriculture business &mdash; the  agribusiness &mdash; what percentage of our food goes to the United Kingdom,  and how much goes to other areas? Is it not the case that the United Kingdom  is our biggest single market and, therefore, our most important market? Have  there not been cases, such as that of dioxins in pork, when it was an advantage  to be part of the United    Kingdom and not of another country?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: The market across the water is our  biggest market; 80% of our produce is exported to Britain. That is no coincidence.  For years, a beef ban did not allow us to market our produce to other  countries. We are still dealing with the residue of that beef ban, which came  out of the BSE crisis. Again, the UK is linked strongly to that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We must also deal with the new markets that are emerging.  People are moving out of rural areas in China  and India,  which are countries with vast populations, into urban settings. They are  becoming more Westernised, and they are eating more beef. There is no reason  why we could not look to those markets for a premium price. Ultimately, this is  about adding value and getting a better outcome for our farmers. They work very  hard to produce quality products, and I want to work equally hard to get them  the best price that I can for those quality products. We will market ourselves  better if we can, and we will do everything that is in our power to ensure that  farmers get a better price for their labour.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Irwin</strong>:  Does the Minister accept that the key stakeholders of the agrifood industry  believe that the UK food  status is to the benefit of Northern Ireland,  given that, as the honourable Member for Lagan  Valley said, much of our food is  exported to the UK  mainland? That being the case, I believe that the Minister is foolish. How can  she justify a removal of UK  status, given that 80% of our food is exported to the mainland?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: As I said, we are a net exporter. We  have a substantial amount of trade with British multiples and their own-label  brands, and, in that environment, it is not easy for us to promote our own  identity.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is in the best interests of the North&rsquo;s beef industry  for it to determine how best to position its products in the markets that it  serves. I will continue to support industry in that respect so that it can  achieve the greatest returns possible. Research into the image of the North&rsquo;s  food and drink in international markets was recently overseen by an  international image group consisting of experienced representatives from export  businesses in the North. That group felt that, in order to gain the optimum  advantage from its unique position, the North&rsquo;s agrifood industry should  utilise all options at its disposal and, depending on the market and the  customer, should market itself as NI, island  of Ireland or UK. That is the  view of the experts.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are fortunate that our products are sold in a wide range  of markets and, that being the case, branding is tailored for specific markets  in a manner that optimises the benefit of the North&rsquo;s multiple identities. In  the current economic climate, it is particularly important that our local  businesses have the capacity to market their products in such a way that  ensures that they have access to premium markets.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When I represented the North in Washington  two years ago, I met representatives of companies such as Tayto crisps and  Johnsons Coffee, who said that they had developed markets in America by  doing just that. No company should be foolish enough to close itself down to  the possibility of other markets due to the way that it markets itself. There  is much to be gained from such marketing; I am told that by industry, and I am also  told that I need to do all that I can to maximise that gain.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  My party has been concerned about the UK identification tag on our cattle  for a long time. We have seen that as a barrier to marketing, particularly in  instances of crises, such as the export ban on beef and the outbreak of  foot-and-mouth disease. Evidently, the Minister sees the advantage to the dairy  and beef industries of having Irish or local identity. What is she doing to  bring that about?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I have been working on regionalisation  since I came into office, and my track record speaks for itself. The UK prefix did  work against us, especially during the years of the beef ban. That ban was in  force when the SDLP held the post of Agriculture Minister, and nothing was done  about that issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I ensure that we do everything that we can to move our  products and get a better price for them. Across the water, they have diseased  status due to bluetongue. However, in case anyone would think that I am picking  on it, that is not only the case across the water; bluetongue is endemic across  Europe. This is the only country in Europe that does not have a problem with bluetongue. If  we cannot capitalise on that now, when will we be able to?</p>
    <p class="H5StageHeading">Rural Development Programme: Axis 3</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mr  Cobain </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development for her  assessment of the delay involving her Department and the axis 3 council  clusters in agreeing a scoring mechanism.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2974/09>(AQO  2974/09)</a></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I am not sure whether Fred asked  question 4 or a supplementary question. I did not hear it in Irish, so I do not  know which he was asking. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The axis 3 council clusters have no involvement in developing  the project assessments scoring mark frame; that responsibility falls to my  Department, as the managing authority. It was agreed by the programme  monitoring committee that the mark frame developed by my officials should be  reviewed by the monitoring committee equality subgroup to ensure that a fair  and equitable scoring mechanism is developed to assess all applications to the  programme, be they from farmers, private promoters or the social economy and  community sectors.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased to confirm that the scoring mechanism has been  agreed with the equality subgroup and has been issued to all joint committees  and local action groups. Last week, the local action group GROW, which covers  Antrim, Carrickfergus and Newtownabbey, used a  scoring framework for the first assessment panel for projects. It successfully  scored nine projects and approved five, worth just over &pound;200,000, to go forward  to their full local action group board. I commend that group on its progress.  At least two further areas will hold assessment panels over the next couple of  weeks.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members will agree that it is vital that the scoring  mechanism reflects all the relevant equality issues and still enables strong  and sustainable projects to benefit from the programme funds. It is only by ensuring  that that we will reap the benefits of a good, strong and sustainable rural  community. The review of the projects scoring mark framework has continued  unabated in the areas that have opened for calls. Project staff are carrying  out eligibility checks and site visits on the applications, in preparation for  their assessment by the local action groups.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cobain</strong>: I  am glad that the Minister answered both the question and my supplementary.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  I welcome the fact that the Minister has reached the stage where the  information is being passed to the local action groups. Does she accept that it  has taken too long to get that information agreed and passed to the groups;  that rural areas for which axis 3 is designed have suffered because a decision  was not made until today; and that there will be no more delays?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Develop&shy;ment</strong>: I can assure the Member that a new  delivery model for axis 3 affords councils a greater and more central role in  delivering rural development measures. Their involvement in delivering that  will provide good training in preparation for the greater responsibility of  councils for rural development delivery under the new RPA. However, the spend  is now getting on the ground, letters are going out, and I can assure the  Member that there will be no further delays.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. What assistance is available under  axis 3 for renewable energy projects?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: A number of areas are helping us to  support renewable energy. In addition, my Department is reviewing its renewable  energy strategy, the outcome of which will inform the axis 3 position on  stand-alone energy projects. In the interim, the Department is working to  promote the use of renewable energy and energy efficiency through our renewable  energy action plan. Key actions include support for profitable energy production;  supply chain development; forestry products and by-products; use of agriwaste  for energy; deployment of renewable energy technologies in the wider economy;  and energy efficiency. CAFRE is also delivering technology transfer programmes  on renewable energy. I have a very long supplementary, and I am conscious of  time, so I am giving you just the bare bones.</p>
    <p class="H5StageHeading">Rural Champion</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mrs  McGill</strong> To ask the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development to outline  her proposals for developing a &lsquo;Rural Champion&rsquo; concept and improving the rural  proofing process.&nbsp; <a name=AQO2975/09>(AQO 2975/09)</a></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development: I am  delighted to have the opportunity to update you on the rural champion concept  and improving the rural-proofing process. I have finalised the programme in  just the past two weeks and intend to present them to Executive colleagues as  soon as I can.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In summary, the key proposals include a phased process for  the invigoration of rural proofing; support for activities that assist the  better co-ordination or facilitation of rural stakeholders; development of a  framework for dialogue between all government Departments and rural  stakeholders; and creation of a rural evidence base and rural research  programme that can support policy and programme development.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Those proposals aim to deliver a collaborative, integrated  approach to the development of policy across government, ensuring the full  involvement of stakeholders and the robust application of rural proofing. The  outcomes that we seek include equitable access to services by rural  communities, an enhanced rural-proofing process and access to a supportive rural  evidence base.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. My question was about rural  proofing, and the Minister referred to that. However, the Minister referred  earlier to all the Departments. Given the difficulties of rural planning, is  the Minister content, in her deliberations with the Minister of the  Environment, that those who want to live in rural areas will be able to do so?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development: I am  a member of the interdepartmental subgroup on planning policy. In that  capacity, I have made a strong case not just for farmers but for rural dwellers  to be able to live in their own communities. I have also formed an  interdepartmental committee on rural policy, which I chair, which will  incorporate senior policy&shy;makers from each Department, including the Department  of the Environment. That is another mechanism for getting that message across  loud and clear.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>:  Will there be any legislative base for rural proofing?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: The rural White Paper will help to firm  that up. In the past, we have seen almost a voluntary option for rural  proofing. That has not worked. I am trying to ensure that rural communities can  be sure that consideration of rural matters has moved on from a tick-box  exercise. Therefore, if legislative proposals are needed, I will be happy to  take them through.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  Does the Minister agree that the introduction of an improved transportation  service to and from rural schools would be an important inclusion in the rural  White Paper?</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Rural transport, particularly for  children, is one of the issues that I raised at the meeting of the ministerial  subgroup on children and young people. Everyone wants our roads to be safe,  especially given the tragedy that happened in Fermanagh in the latter part of  2008.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Children who have to walk considerable distances on narrow  roads that have a lot of traffic but no footpaths or street lighting must be  safe. A rural transport policy would help to bring that about. These things do  not come cheap, but it is worth spending money on them.</p>
    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="8"></a>Executive Committee Business</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Supply Resolution for the 2009-2010 Main Estimates</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Debate resumed on motion:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That this Assembly approves that a sum, not exceeding  &pound;7,566,927,000, be granted out of the Consolidated Fund, for or towards  defraying the charges for Northern Ireland Departments, the Northern Ireland  Assembly Commission, the Assembly Ombudsman for Northern Ireland and Northern  Ireland Commissioner for Complaints, the Food Standards Agency, the Northern  Ireland Audit Office and the Northern Ireland Authority for Utility Regulation  for the year ending 31st March 2010 and that resources, not exceeding  &pound;8,311,830,000, be authorised for use by Northern Ireland Departments, the  Northern Ireland Assembly Commission, the Assembly Ombudsman for Northern  Ireland and Northern Ireland Commissioner for Complaints, the Food Standards  Agency, the Northern Ireland Audit Office and the Northern Ireland Authority  for Utility Regulation for the year ending 31st March 2010 as summarised for  each Department or other public body in columns 3 (b) and 3 (a) of table 1.3 in  the volume of the Northern Ireland Estimates 2009-10 that was laid before the  Assembly on 29 May 2009. &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment.]</span></span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mrs I Robinson)</strong>:  The Supply resolution debate is an opportunity to highlight some of the  budgetary challenges that face each Department in the current financial year. I  should like to mention some of the financial issues that face the Health  Department.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department&rsquo;s major challenge is undoubtedly the  achievement of the 3% efficiency savings. The Department receives around half  of the total block grant and, therefore, has to achieve half of the total  efficiency savings. The Minister has given an assurance that he will meet those  targets, but the challenge is to do that without affecting front line services.  The Minister stated that he achieved the &pound;118 million efficiency savings target  in 2008-09. However, given that a total of &pound;700 million of efficiencies must be  achieved over the three-year period, there is clearly some way still to go.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There have been major public concerns about home closures  and cuts in nursing numbers. A reduction of some 722 nurses is proposed over  the three-year period. There was a debate on that issue in the Chamber in  February. We called on the Minister to ensure that front line services are not  affected.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At that stage, I pointed out that the proposals would  result in an estimated total reduction of approximately 2,475 Health Service  jobs over the three-year period. That takes account both of efficiencies and  any additional investments. In light of the worrying estimate that there will  be a reduction of 722 nurses and midwives, I made the point that one cannot  remove that many nursing and midwifery posts without directly and detrimentally  affecting front line services.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee has played its part by highlighting the  challenges, listening to the arguments and pressing the Minister to protect  vital services. The Committee heard from the Minister and from each of the  trusts about specific plans and proposals. It heard from the unions that  represent employees who are directly affected by cuts. Indeed, in recent days,  the unions have asked to meet the Committee again about the efficiency plans.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Trust proposals to achieve 3% savings have been the subject  of public consultation. The Committee also heard from district councils and  local groups that are concerned about specific services in their areas. The new  health and social care structures that came into place in April have led to a  rationalisation of bodies and a slimmer and more accountable service through a  reduction in the number of public bodies and in bureaucracy and administrative  costs. That is welcome, and it will make a significant contribution to  achieving the efficiency savings target. However, it still leaves a major gap,  and we must continue to ensure that the measures that are implemented do not  cut patient services.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The outbreak of swine flu will place an additional burden  on finances. Earlier today, the Minister highlighted the need for additional  funding to deal with the pandemic. Detailed plans have been developed in recent  years to deal with such an event, and those are now being put into practice. It  is difficult to predict the impact of swine flu at this stage, but considerable  expenditure has already been predicted on antiviral drugs, vaccines and so on.  If large numbers of cases are experienced, there will be additional costs for  trusts and additional pressures on hospital and community services.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Capital funding is another big issue for the Health  Department, despite an investment of almost &pound;700 million over the three-year  period. The construction industry group told the Health Committee that more  projects should be funded to provide improved health facilities and, indeed, to  bring some facilities that are in dire need of repair up to minimum standards  while providing much-needed employment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There have been many calls for capital funding to bring  forward the proposed new women and children&rsquo;s hospital in Belfast. That scheme is long delayed, and  replacement is needed urgently. Unfortunately, the scheme has not yet been  scheduled for funding. The Health Committee visited the existing hospitals and  saw the poor state of the buildings and the crowded conditions at first hand.  The Committee pressed the Minister to bring the project forward as soon as  possible.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although we accept that the financial climate is dire, in  my capacity as the DUP&rsquo;s health spokesperson, I must ask the question: given  all the money that is being pumped into the Health Department, why are Members  still hearing the same old stories in their constituencies about the lack of front  line services with respect to staff, trained nurses, special-needs nurses to  deal with autism and other difficulties, and speech therapists? We have to ask  whether our Minister is doing the right thing with the money in hand. It really  concerns the public that the money does not seem to be improving the Health  Service per se and that there seems to be a black hole.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I welcome the opportunity to speak  about the Supply resolution, which is the mechanism for ensuring that funding  is released to continue the priorities set out in the Programme for Government.  Members have an opportunity to debate the issues, but it is important to  remember that if the motion is not passed, there will be no money for the  associated programmes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is no doubt that the economic recession has presented  the Executive with a number of difficulties, in particular the need to offset  the rising number of job losses. It is also a major challenge to help families  and businesses who are in economic difficulties. Sinn F&eacute;in Members have  consistently pointed out in many debates in the Chamber and beyond that the  block grant from the British Government is totally inadequate. In the context  of that financial shortfall, and with no control over fiscal policy, we will  continue to carry the burden of trying to match our limited resources with  people&rsquo;s increasing needs. Today, I noticed that the Scottish Parliament is  pushing ahead with tax-varying powers, and I hope that the Assembly and the  Executive will come back to that debate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The only way to sustain economic and social progress in the  long term is on an all-island basis. It makes sense to end the duplication and  inefficiencies that are being perpetuated by having two health services, two  education services and two separate institutions governing separate parts of  the island. Given the small population on the island, the Assembly and the  Executive need to be debating that issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, for today&rsquo;s debate, I turn to how families, communities  and businesses have been affected by the economic recession, and whether we can  examine the way in which the Executive deliver the investment strategy and  Programme for Government to make a difference to the quality of their lives.  Many low-income households, the elderly and the sick were finding it difficult  to make ends meet prior to the recession, but many have now spiralled into even  deeper poverty, particularly those living in deprived areas.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to touch on a number of initiatives that are sitting  in Departments. The credit union legislation was debated in the Assembly and  received cross-party support. Introducing that legislation would give credit  unions the extra powers that they need. That would benefit not only the people  who borrow from credit unions, but those who would be helped by the way in  which the money would be invested. For instance, credit unions are keen on  investing a large amount of money to meet the needs of social housing. The  Assembly must, therefore, push forward on that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The enhancement of debt-advisory services is another issue  that must be progressed. There appears to be some blockage; although the motion  was passed by the Assembly, nothing has happened. The Minister of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment is present today, and I hope that she will push forward  with that so that specialist debt advisers can be placed in the community to  help people who face difficulties.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The legislation on dormant bank accounts has not yet been  implemented. Such accounts contain millions of pounds that could be used for  voluntary and community projects that face cuts. The money would facilitate the  continued delivery of services, and the skills of those who deliver front line  services could be retained in communities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Several Government-funded initiatives have tried to help  businesses, particularly small and medium- sized enterprises (SMEs), that face  financial difficulties, and the Assembly has often debated the subject. A  recent survey by the Institute   of Directors highlights  the widespread lack of awareness and minimal uptake of some of the  Government-backed schemes. There is an onus on the Government, the Assembly and  the Executive to ensure that businesses are aware of the schemes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are still problems with the banks, particularly for  people who want to take out a new loan or an overdraft. It seems that certain  problems persist despite Members continually discussing them in the Chamber. If  the Assembly could push forward on tackling such issues, it would help some of  the affected businesses.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to focus on the process of public procurement, which  offers the Executive the opportunity to develop a policy that includes social  and environmental clauses that would help people. The Governments, North and  South, have an opportunity to maximise the social and employment opportunities  of everyone through their public procurement processes. That forms an essential  part of the investment strategy. It is more important than ever to grasp that  opportunity because existing jobs must be secured and new ones created.  Unemploy&shy;ment is rising, and the two main problems facing people at present are  the fear of losing their jobs and of descending into debt and poverty. The  Assembly must do all that it can to secure existing jobs and to create new  employment opportunities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive earmarked almost &pound;20 billion for public procurement.  The Assembly has debated the issue before, but I want to emphasise that, in an  all-island context, most of the &euro;16 billion spent on public procurement each  year goes to companies overseas; local businesses are often smaller and cannot  even get on to the procurement ladder. Ninety-nine per cent of businesses in  the North are SMEs. Those in the social-economy sector that deliver front line  services to communities also create employment opportunities for local people,  including the long-term unemployed, and they provide the quality  apprenticeships that are needed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some SMEs cannot even apply for public-procurement  contracts. They fail at the tendering stage, which they feel is stacked against  them and weighted firmly in favour of large companies, most of which are based  overseas. That does not generate money in the economy; it is taken out of the island of Ireland. The money must be generated  internally to create jobs for people here. Through public procurement and  working closely with organisations such as InterTradeIreland, Invest NI, IDA  Ireland and the enterprise councils, North and South, there is an excellent  opportunity to encourage and develop SMEs on this island so that they can  secure contracts.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Businesses in the North should have equal access to public  procurement contracts in the South and vice versa. As it stands, there is no  equality of access in the North or the South because the process is strongly  weighted in favour of large companies.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I reiterate that incorporating those social clauses into  all public procurement contracts at the tendering stage enables delivery on the  important issues of fairness, inclusion and equality of opportunity by actively  and effectively challenging existing patterns of social and economic  disadvantage. We must use increased prosperity in future to tackle ongoing  poverty.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, my party will continue to press for the full  range of fiscal powers to be made available to the Executive and the Assembly.  I hope that other parties will get behind that stance, because the powers are  required to facilitate the delivery of high-quality public services, to develop  the economy and to build prosperity. To that end, we will seek to ensure the  best use and allocation of resources in the short term.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in shares everybody&rsquo;s concern about the overall  resources that are available and the various stated priorities. However, we are  tasked with meeting the challenge of achieving the best possible outcomes in  the current economic climate. I return to what I said at the outset: some of us  have different points of view that can be debated here, but it is essential  that the mechanism to release the money be approved. If it is not,  organisations and groups will be unable to deliver essential services. Go raibh  maith agat.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Social Development (Mr Simpson)</strong>: I apologise for not  being in the Chamber for the start of the debate, but I had to attend a  Committee meeting.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As part of its review, the Committee for Social Development  considered the Department&rsquo;s Main Estimates and compared them with figures and  targets included in the 2008-2011 Budget.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A number of debates on social housing and the Department&rsquo;s  budget deficit have been held in the House recently. I believe that all Members  now accept that the social housing budget depended on substantial land and  house sales. I also believe that most Members agree that when the property  market declined, budgetary difficulties became inevitable.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On a number of occasions, the House has debated the  Department&rsquo;s monitoring rounds, surrenders and reallocations, newbuild v  off-the-shelf purchases, and related issues. I am sure that the House will  again debate housing and the importance of balancing the housing budget with  the delivery of PSA and other targets. Today, however, I am not focusing on  those issues but am simply requesting further budgetary flexibility for social  housing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members want the PSA target for new social homes to be  achieved and to see progress made in bringing existing houses up to the decent  homes standard. All of that will benefit the economy but will cost a great deal  of money. Most Committee members accept that the Department&rsquo;s budget position  is very difficult. Nonetheless, multiple benefits are associated with  investment in construction and related industries. Therefore, the Committee is  keen to put down a marker for social housing in the event that there is  flexibility in future monitoring rounds.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee also reviewed efficiency in the Department  for Social Development and was pleased to hear the Department assert that the  efficiency target of 3% a year for 2008-2011 will be met. It must be agreed  that, when in a difficult budgetary position, efficiencies are essential.  Notwithstanding that, the majority of Committee members was concerned about  what was described as the driving of efficiency in the Supporting People  programme.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Under that programme, services providers, such as the Simon  Community, the Triangle Housing Association and Women&rsquo;s Aid, can already  demonstrate that they are efficient and good value. Therefore, the Committee  believes that additional funding for providers of the Supporting People  programme in the voluntary and community sector to meet, for example,  contractually agreed salary increases should be made available in the current  budget. I assure the House that, although that is a low-cost request, it will  make a big difference to those organisations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Let me assure the House that the Committee for Social  Development will continue to review and scrutinise closely the Department&rsquo;s  expenditure.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burns</strong>: I  welcome the opportunity to have my say on the spending Estimates, and I am glad  that the Assembly is debating the proper business of government. We are living  in a difficult economic climate, so if ever there was a time for the Assembly  and the Executive to get serious, this is it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I shall say a few words about the Department for Social  Development&rsquo;s budget for social housing. We could spend hours debating that  subject, but my time is limited, so my remarks will be brief. I fear that I may  repeat myself, because only last week, I spoke on this matter in the Chamber.  Although the Minister of Finance and Personnel was not present to respond to  that debate, I am sure that he carefully studied the Official Report and took  all the key points on board.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Everyone knows that DSD&rsquo;s budget has a big hole in the  middle, which is a direct result of the capital-receipt shortfall that the  downturn in the housing and property market caused. The gap is so big that  there is no way that the Minister for Social Development will be able to fill  it by making a few savings here and there. Therefore, more funds must be given  to DSD.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Every Department &mdash; whether it deals with transport, health  or education &mdash; wants more money, but a limited amount of money is available.  Many Departments and their supporters have put forward strong arguments for  more funding, and even within each Department, but particularly within DSD,  there will be many different priorities.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  thank the Member for giving way, and in the absence of the SDLP&rsquo;s Minister,  Margaret Ritchie, I am glad that he is here to defend her. What does the  Minister do with the Housing Executive receipts that she has tried to hide in  the past weeks and months? The honourable Member for North Antrim Mr O&rsquo;Loan  will bear witness to the fact that there is a problem with Egan contracts in  our constituency. Although the Minister has it, she has failed to produce the  money to deliver those contracts. Why blame others?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burns</strong>:  That question should be directed to the Minister. There is simply not enough  money in the DSD budget. Money is required for Egan contracts and for the warm  homes scheme, which has been hugely successful but oversubscribed. Therefore,  the SDLP wants more money to be given to it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As well as more money for the warm homes scheme, the  mortgage rescue scheme, and so on, money must be directed at social housing and  the newbuild programme. Small handouts during the June monitoring round will  simply not be enough.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP identified in its policy document &lsquo;New Priorities  in Difficult Times&rsquo; from where money can be found. A massive cash injection  into the social housing programme is undoubtedly one of the best things that we  can do. The reasons for that are straightforward. By building new houses and  carrying out repairs, we would cut waiting lists, help people in housing stress  and give hope to homeless people.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We will also help the construction industry because  building social housing creates more employment than any other form of capital  investment. If we use land that DSD and the Housing Executive already own, we  could build even more houses.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Simpson</strong>: I know that the Member sits on the  Committee for Social Development. Does he agree that the Department and his  Minister should consider innovative ideas on how to push forward the programme  of social and affordable housing, for example, by working more closely with the  housing associations that sit with millions of pounds in their accounts and do  not use it?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burns</strong>: I agree. The Minister is looking at ways to  bring forward schemes to create more houses that people can afford. There must  be a way for us to tap into the housing associations&rsquo; money and land banks and  get the housing programme started. If we were to do that, we would be able to put  more money straight into the wage packets of construction workers and into the  accounts of local building firms. Construction costs have also fallen sharply,  so it is a good time to push forward with those projects so that we get the  best possible value for money.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said earlier, I fear that I am repeating myself. I  know that the housing projects are only one part of the solution and that there  is no magic wand. However, I also know that the Minister is well aware of the  economics of building social housing. I hope that the Finance Minister will  work with the Social Development Minister to push forward the new building  programme as quickly as possible and give her the money that she so badly  needs.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: This is one of a number of debates that have been  held about the Budget over the past few years. For those of us who are regular  contributors to those debates, there is a great sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu that always  permeates them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member mentioned that social housing was not a magic  wand. Listening to the SDLP, however, one would think that it is the cure for  all our ills. That party tells us that the economy&rsquo;s problems will be solved by  providing more housing, although nobody could convincingly argue that that is  the case. I am awaiting the SDLP&rsquo;s putting forward social housing as the cure  for swine flu. Perhaps it will put social housing forward as a suggestion to  Alex Ferguson as to how he should fill the gap that will be left by the sale of  Cristiano Ronaldo. Perhaps Manchester United&rsquo;s problems would be solved if he  embraced the spirit of greater degrees of social housing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Again, the answer from the SDLP is to produce another  Budget. I commend the party for at least producing its proposals, although I  have been &mdash; and I continue to be &mdash; somewhat critical of their contents.  However, even taking its Budget proposals at face value, I think that they  impact only about 1% of the budgetary process when it comes to resources. We  are told that there needs to be an all-singing, all-dancing new Budget, but 99%  of it remains unaltered under the SDLP proposals.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Without going into the detail, with which I have dealt on a  previous occasion, a wide range of the SDLP&rsquo;s proposals regarding where the  money will come from are highly questionable when they are scrutinised. For  example, the reprofiling of Housing Executive debt would require the support of  the Treasury. I think that that is fairly unlikely. The funding for the  multi-sports stadium is earmarked for elsewhere. The Invest NI surplus funds  are somewhat illusory in nature. There are a range of other matters that, quite  frankly, do not add up.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, I give that party credit for at least putting  forward proposals. At least it has done the decent thing and stayed for the  second part of the debate. By contrast, there is a deafening silence from the  Ulster Unionist Party Benches, which is not surprising as none of them have  even bothered to be here for this part of the debate. Silence is also what  pervades the Ulster Unionist proposals in respect of alternatives to the Budget.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It seems to me that the Ulster Unionists suffered from  political and economic amnesia at various stages today. Their biggest lapse was  that they are in some way separate from the Executive; whereas, in fact, two  members of their party sit on the Executive and have endorsed the proposal at  that level. As another Member pointed out, the Ulster Unionists were keen to  criticise the Programme for Government today, yet, when asked about it on &lsquo;The  Politics Show&rsquo;, their leader and one of their Ministers said that there was no  need to recast the Programme for Government as it was fundamentally sound. I  know that not just from watching the programme but from sitting about six feet  from the said gentlemen during the debate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is also amnesia among the party&rsquo;s Members. We heard  from the modern-day Galileo of the Ulster Unionist Party, Mr McNarry, on his  quest for the black hole. I will bow to the superior knowledge of the  honourable Member Dr Farry, who described it as a quasar. I thought that a quasar  was one of those laser battles that took place in an arena near the Ormeau Road. In the  illusory search for the black hole, one is reminded of a mythical search for  the Holy Grail. Mr McNarry keeps searching for that black hole, yet, curiously,  does not find it. On the one hand, the first Member to speak on behalf of the  Ulster Unionists, Mr McNarry, accused us of creating a massive black hole in  the Budget; yet the criticism from the second Ulster Unionist Member to speak,  Mr Beggs, was that we were &ldquo;balancing the books&rdquo;. Balancing the books is a  fairly tame criticism; some Administrations would be delighted if that was the  only criticism made of them. It shows the contradiction at the heart of Ulster  Unionist thinking on the issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is an all-pervasive silence from the Ulster Unionists  on alternatives, although, to be fair to them, they produced at least one: Mr  McNarry&rsquo;s idea of some sort of equity release scheme involving selling off all  our assets and then mortgaging them back. Any independent expert would advise  that that idea is not a runner with the Treasury. Perhaps that explains why,  having put the issue into the ether, there suddenly seems to be silence on it.  It has all gone very quiet. The Ulster Unionist Party has suggested no  alternative.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Even taking the SDLP changes at face value, and, as I said,  I have serious doubts about whether they are realisable, the amount of money  that is proposed is less than half that realised by the various monitoring  rounds over the past two years. More than &pound;1 billion has been reallocated.  Although it is believed that the Budget process has been fundamentally sound,  there has been an opportunity to readjust. Indeed, the Executive, of which, in  case the SDLP has forgotten, it is also a member, have undertaken various  measures to tackle the crisis. We have seen the announcement of the relief for  small businesses and the freezing of regional rates for the non-domestic  sector. We have also seen proposals from the Economic Development Forum, which  was set up by the Executive to deal with construction, the financing of SMEs,  businesses in difficulties, and skills. Measures have been introduced and there  is more to come. Pro-active action is being taken.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The reason why there is a need for adjustments rather than  a fundamental review is that, in both the Budget and the Programme for  Government, the Executive put economic development at the top of their  priorities. Calls for re-prioritisation prompt the question: how exactly is  something to come above number one on the list? Should another issue be placed  ahead of economic development? The economy is at the centre of the proposals  and at the heart of Government. The Executive have acted. However, there will be  a limit to what can be done, because contrasting what we do with other  Governments&rsquo; measures is not comparing like with like. Ultimately, we are a  regional Government dealing with a block grant.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There may well be more difficult times ahead; I bow to the superior  knowledge of the Ulster Unionists on that, because we see the slash-and-burn of  the Conservative Party&rsquo;s proposals and the potential that they hold for large  cutbacks.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One assumes that the Ulster Unionist Party would have  sought some sort of guarantee that future block grants for Northern Ireland  would be protected before any degree of reciprocation or electoral arrangements  were made with the Conservative Party. However, that does not seem to have  figured in any way in the Ulster Unionists&rsquo; calculations. I am happy to give  way to any Ulster Unionist Member who is willing to confirm that the  Conservative Party will add the Northern    Ireland block grant to the list of items  that it says it will protect in the next Parliament. The silence is deafening.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: As  I said earlier, the Labour Government have accrued huge debts, and they will  have to be repaid. Regardless of whether a Labour Government or a Conservative  Government are in power, the British Exchequer will have to make significant  repayments in the next number of years. That will affect finances throughout  the United Kingdom,  irrespective of who occupies Number 10. Does the Member accept that?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: Yet  again, the honourable Member misses the point. Due to the difficulties that Northern Ireland  has faced, one assumes that any party would, at least, have sought to protect  the region from which it comes before making any electoral arrangement with  another party. The DUP is not linked with the Labour Party or the Conservative  Party; we are here to defend Northern    Ireland, first and foremost. The  Conservatives have announced a number of areas in which they will offer  protection in public spending, whereas there will be large cuts elsewhere.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am happy to give way to any Ulster Unionist Member who  can assure the House that the protection of the Northern Ireland block grant was  part of that party&rsquo;s negotiations with the Conservative Party, but, again, the  silence is deafening.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The process that we have put forward is one &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  have only about five seconds left, but I will give way.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  We should not be proud of ourselves, because, one year after the announcement  of the Budget, we have not got a children&rsquo;s strategy in place.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  Considering that we are in a recession and that children are suffering, that is  disgusting.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I want to respond to one matter that Mr Weir raised. He failed utterly to grasp  the inconsistency that was evident in his last point to Mr Beggs. He berated Mr  Beggs for not securing protection for the Northern Ireland economy, given the  Ulster Unionists&rsquo; relationship with the Conservative Party. However, the DUP  boasted about the protections for the Northern Ireland budget that it had  secured from Gordon Brown and Tony Blair, and those protections went out the  window in Gordon Brown&rsquo;s recently announced efficiency cuts strategy. Perhaps,  the next time that he wants to challenge &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I will not give way until later. Mr Weir was not himself able to secure the  very thing that he asks of another party. If he cannot see the inconsistency  and contradiction, shame on him.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If this debate is to mean anything, the Minister has to respond  today, on the eve of recess, to four or five representative issues that have  been in and around the Chamber over the past two months. First, can the  Minister come to the Chamber today and confirm for Members, and for everyone  else, who will chair the Senior Salaries Review Body, and what its time frame  is in bringing forward its proposals? Does the Minister agree that if a review  is to have any value, it should go further than the Senior Civil Service  salaries? There is now a need to look at the salaries of other people in senior  posts in publicly-funded organisations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">According to media reports, the vice chancellor of Queen&rsquo;s  University had a 13&middot;3% salary increase in the past financial year, and it has  been mooted that he will have an increase of 5&middot;5% in the current financial  year. His salary has increased by one third in four years.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In a year such as this, when other staff have been offered  an increase of 0&middot;5%, and given that this Government provide Queen&rsquo;s University  and other higher education institutions with &pound;2 of every &pound;5 that goes to their  coffers, is it not time for this Government and Assembly to cast their net  further than the Northern Ireland Civil Service and look at Northern Ireland  chief executives who receive substantial pay from the public purse.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In my view it is unsustainable to &mdash; rightly &mdash; ask our civil  servants to have a review of their pay and conditions when we do not apply the  same principle to institutions such as Queen&rsquo;s University, which receives more  than &pound;90 million of its &pound;250 million annual income from central Government.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My second question to the Minister involves a report that  appeared in &lsquo;The Irish News&rsquo; on Saturday and concerns Queen&rsquo;s University; I use  that institution only as a general example of a publicly funded body. The  article contained leaked information from the university&rsquo;s unpublished  corporate plan. It said that:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;informed forecasts suggest that the university should  be planning for a 10 per cent reduction in government income by 2012-13.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">What does Queen&rsquo;s University know that the rest of  us, who are meant to be in and around Government in the North, do not? What  information can Queen&rsquo;s University put into a document that may be published and  that quotes informed sources saying that there will be:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;a 10 per cent reduction in government income by  2012-13.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Why have we not heard about that, if that is what  will happen?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister or DFP know about any plans for major  cutbacks or efficiency savings to the tune of 10% that might affect higher or  further education institutions, or other publicly funded bodies in the North?  In my view, such predictions raise a lot of questions and anxieties that we  have an obligation to calm or, at least, discuss.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Weir&rsquo;s comments were verging on cheap and shameful when  he compared the issue of social housing and Margaret Ritchie&rsquo;s requirements in  respect of that and the SDLP &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  ask the Member to withdraw the accusation that I am &ldquo;verging&rdquo; on cheap and  shameful.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  That comment says a lot about the person who has just made that intervention.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My point is that if Mr Weir does not believe that the SDLP  proposals on social housing are a panacea, he should ignore them. However, the  current Finance Minister and, perhaps, a future Finance Minister, cannot ignore  the evidence in the Smyth/Bailey report. That report says that the construction  sector was the most exposed of all employers in the North. It says that for  every 10 construction jobs there will be seven other jobs. It says that,  although hundreds of millions of pounds have been released by Governments in London and Scotland  for construction projects in the recession, there has been no response of a  similar scale in the North.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The argument that Smyth and Bailey put forward is that it  is possible &mdash; in my view, it is probable &mdash; that the single biggest intervention  that one can make in a time of recession is to build houses, not only for all  the reasons that I have outlined, or because costs in the North are down by 17%  compared with what they were a short time ago, but for all the other social and  wider community reasons that uplift a society that has secure housing. The  Minister can ignore the SDLP proposals if she chooses, but she cannot ignore  serious academic evidence that outlines a strategy that is based on social and  affordable housing and that can make an immediate and serious intervention in  our economic situation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Moreover, I ask the Minister to confirm whether she or the  DUP agree with what Fra McCann of Sinn F&eacute;in said in last week&rsquo;s housing debate.  He said that if there were &pound;110 million of unspent DSD money for the Royal  Exchange projects, Sinn F&eacute;in would support the SDLP&rsquo;s argument and:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;agree if that &pound;110 million were moved across by the  Minister, it would deal with the problems that we face&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official Report, Vol 41,  No 7, p284, col 1]</span></span>.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The problems being in respect of the housing  shortfalls.</p>

    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the DUP confirm, through the Minister, that it agrees  with the SDLP and Sinn F&eacute;in that in the event that that &pound;110 million becomes  available in the next monitoring round or in future monitoring rounds before  the end of the financial year it will be authorised to be put back into DSD&rsquo;s  construction and housing budget? On 7 January, the DFP Minister told the DSD  Minister that he accepted the argument that a lack of housing money had a disproportionate  material impact on the construction industry in the North.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Two of the Minister&rsquo;s ministerial colleagues came to the  House recently; Martin McGuinness on 5 May and Gerry Kelly on 20 April. They  spoke about the fact that a childcare strategy was being developed. Indeed, on  5 May 2009, the deputy First Minister said:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;I understand that a meeting of the relevant Ministers  has been arranged for 28 May 2009 to discuss it.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official Report, Vol 40,  No 5, p215, col 2]</span></span>.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I know that that subject is dear to the Minister&rsquo;s  heart because a year and a half ago when we talked about childminding in the  North we shared a photograph in the &lsquo;Belfast Telegraph&rsquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister confirm whether that report has been  received and will she confirm that money has been allocated to fund that  report? Will we have a situation at the end of August where, once again,  childcare organisations such as PlayBoard will come to the end of their funding  stream? Those are simple questions: has the report been received and is the  money available?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Equally, given the DUP&rsquo;s surrender, on 1 June, on the equal  pay issue where, variously, Simon Hamilton accused other parties of playing  politics, etc, only for the DUP to withdraw its amendment; is the money in the  coffers to pay for the equal pay consequences in the event that agreement is  reached quickly about who should get what amount of money?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member draw his remarks to a close?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  Those are five questions. I hope that I receive five answers today or some time  after today.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Chairperson of the Committee for Education (Mr  Storey): I speak as Chairperson of the Committee for Education. I wish to  highlight some aspects of the Committee&rsquo;s scrutiny of the Department of  Education&rsquo;s budget, which are reflected in the Main Estimates. For those who  have trawled through that small document, the details can be found on pages 57  to 86 of the &lsquo;Northern Ireland Estimates 2009-2010&rsquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One of the Committee&rsquo;s key areas of budget scrutiny  continues to be the &pound;200 million earmarked primarily for schools and youth  services; approximately 10% of the overall education budget for 2008-09. The  Minister of Education recognises that earmarking budgets erodes flexibility in  the use of resources, and the Department has been assessing the scope for  mainstreaming budgets directly to education users, mainly schools.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee&rsquo;s objective is to increase the overall  percentage of the education budget that goes directly to schools, and no one in  the House would argue that that is not of paramount importance. How many of us have  visited schools and spoken to boards of governors, principals and staff and  found that the recurring issue that they want to see resolved is about money  going directly to schools? The overall percentage of the education budget that  goes directly to schools here is 62%, which is much lower than in other parts  of the United Kingdom  and some of our neighbouring European countries. The Committee for Education&rsquo;s particular  focus in that area is to encourage the Minister to increase delegated funding  through the common funding formula to primary schools and reduce the current  differential in average funding levels between primary and post-primary  schools.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In a letter that the Committee received from the Minister in  July 2008, she stated that:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;baseline funds for distribution to schools in 2009/10  provide for a further increase in primary AWPU funding (from current level of  1.04 to 1.05), from next year &ndash; with a view to increasing progressively the  relative funding levels distributed to primary schools under the LMS funding  arrangements across the budget period.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Although that increase is welcome, it is not  enough; we must go further.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members of the Committee and Members of the House will have  attended various presentations and seminars or have been lobbied by  organisations such as Early Years. All those organisations stress the  importance of early intervention in ensuring the delivery of good educational  outcomes in the future, but those outcomes cannot be delivered if the adequate  financial resources are not in place. Therefore, although the uplift to the  AWPU (age weighted pupil limit) is welcome, as any additional funding is, the  Committee feels that it is not enough to close the gap and deal with the  differential between primary and post-primary schools.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee welcomes the fact that there will be an  increase of almost &pound;27 million in the delegated budget for primary schools in  the 2009-2010 education Estimates. A small element of that is additional  funding, but that change demonstrates to the House that limited budgets can be  used to better effect. The use of delegated funding allows primary schools to  determine how they wish to use such funds to best meet their own needs and  priorities, which is particularly important as needs and priorities can differ  from area to area.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Estimates touch on another aspect of the education  budget that continues to be a matter of concern for Committee members and, no  doubt, members of the House: school maintenance. There is a huge schools&rsquo;  estate in Northern Ireland, and it may come as a shock to Members to learn that  the backlog for carrying out maintenance to that estate across the five  education and library boards has risen to somewhere in the region of &pound;200  million. Although it is imperative to have a speedy and effective procurement  system in place, we must raise the major issues around the way in which  procurement is being delivered. We are not seeing a lot of newbuilds being  built and those that are being built are not being built quickly enough. I  declare an interest as a member of the board of governors of Ballymoney High School,  which has been waiting since January 2009 for the Department to finalise the  financial arrangements that would allow it to cut the first sod and begin  construction of the school that it was promised three years ago.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Several Members made references to the construction  industry during today&rsquo;s debate, and the call for that industry to be given the  green light to move forward must be extended to the education sector. We must  be more aware and focused rather than allow ourselves to be held up by  bureaucracy and red tape.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Let us adopt a can-do attitude. I have grave concerns about  the way in which we govern ourselves. There is no point in my trying to blame  other Ministers. If we are to have an Assembly, we need to take collective  responsibility. Often, we do not adopt a can-do attitude when trying to move  forward on these matters.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The issue of the maintenance budget must be urgently  addressed to ensure that there is no further decline in the educational estate  and that more problems do not arise in years to come as a result of delay and  the system being unable to respond adequately and quickly enough.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee noted the additional &pound;5 million in the final  monitoring round for 2008-09 and the Department of Education&rsquo;s bid for &pound;14&middot;8  million in the current monitoring round. However, during a recent budget  briefing by senior departmental officials, the Committee heard that the current  education and library boards now have no set school-maintenance budgets. That  is a matter of grave concern.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have examined the Estimates that relate to the Department  of Education. It is worrying, to say the least, that no established  school-maintenance budget is included in the tables on pages 59 and 61. That is  particularly worrying when one considers the &pound;200 million backlog to which I  referred earlier. I can assure the House that the Committee for Education will  scrutinise that matter in some detail, and will ask the Minister of Education  to put the proper budget arrangements in place for schools maintenance.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I speak on behalf of the  SDLP, not the Education Committee. Mr Storey has done that eloquently, and  although I may echo some points that he made, I do so to underline their  importance.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I begin with the issue of the procurement of capital  projects in education; newbuilds, as they are better known. The Department of  Education is notoriously slow in providing new schools, with delays running  into years, and, in some cases, into a second decade. That is totally  unacceptable at a time when we need an injection of capital into the building  industry in this part of the country. In that procurement process, every second  year of delay requires a fresh economic appraisal, which creates further delay.  It is a vicious circle. For projects costing more than &pound;5 million, DFP requires  what is known as a BREEAM assessment, which may mean a fundamental redesign and  restructuring of a project, creating further and longer delays.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That type of bureaucracy is a mire that causes delays that  are impacting on the delivery of the education service at the chalk face. It  would be of great assistance to those awaiting newbuilds if, for example, DFP  could streamline its procedures and those of the Department of Education in  such a way as to fast-track schemes to ensure that there are no delays, or that  any delays are kept to a bare minimum. Such a development would provide a major  stimulus to the building industry at a time when it is on its knees, and when  the queue of unemployed construction workers is lengthening by the day. We need  to bring new school builds on stream much quicker than is the case at the  moment. We literally cannot afford those delays.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Storey referred to the difficulties of school  maintenance. In response to a question that I asked the Minister of Education  on that issue, she gave an answer that ran to more than 60 pages. As Mr Storey  said, the backlog in school maintenance is more than &pound;200 million. Newbuilds  would go some way to reducing that, but the bid of &pound;14&middot;6 million in the June  monitoring round is not enough if children are to have access to the best  possible educational facilities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Greater investment in schools&rsquo; maintenance is needed, as  the estate is crumbling due to lack of investment. The maintenance budgets of  education and library boards must be ring-fenced; they have been continually  raided for other purposes throughout the years. That must be put right: money  for educational maintenance must be spent on educational maintenance. Such  investment would also benefit the building industry.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm<span style="font-style:normal; "> </span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">During a debate on 19 May 2009 on special educational  needs, the issue was raised of releasing &pound;25 million to implement the findings  of the special educational needs review. Unfortunately, the matter is not  resolved. Apparently, that resource is still locked in dispute at Executive  level. Many parents who have children with special educational needs wonder why  a local devolved Executive is failing to release a valuable resource that would  go some way to providing better educational services to their children. The  issue must be resolved immediately: further delay will reflect extremely poorly  on government here.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Other important reviews need resources to be allocated to  them, including the nought-to-six strategy and the review of Irish-medium  education.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The unregulated system of transfer that has emerged under  the Minister has meant that area-based planning has not progressed at the rate  at which it should have. Nevertheless, school closures and reorganisation are  proceeding, with the axe hanging over many small rural schools. It seems  sensible that school closures and school reorganisation should be stalled until  properly agreed area-based plans are developed. The Executive should commit to  providing financial support for small viable rural schools at risk of closure  until proper area-based plans are developed.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  I agree with the Member. The Executive, and not just the Department of  Education, must use logic in the treatment of schools. I take the Member&rsquo;s  point that small schools must be supported in the interim period until  area-based plans are worked out. The Minister of Agriculture and Rural  Development spoke effusively about the publication shortly of a rural White  Paper. Does the Member agree that it makes sense to keep supporting small  schools until the outcome of the rural White Paper is known, as well as the  area-based plans? When that information is available, decisions can be taken  about the future of education provision.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  I agree wholeheartedly with the Member. In fact, this evening, I shall visit a small  rural school that faces closure. That school has enough pupils to make it  viable; in fact, it benefited recently from &pound;250,000 of investment from the  Department of Education. One fails to see the logic when an investment of that  size is made in a small rural school, but, within five years, that school is  designated for closure. That simply does not make sense.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As to transfer 2010, I ask the Minister of Finance whether  any consideration has been given to the possible costs that are associated with  the current unregulated system, which may see the Department of Education  joined in legal challenges that parents take. We may be faced with that  scenario, and it is one for which the Minister should be prepared.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  assume from the thrust of the Member&rsquo;s question that he is concerned about  whether transfer 2010 will cost us more. Does he join with me in saying that in  our segregated system, the maintained sector has cost three or four times the  size of the budget? Alliance Party Members will know that I am good at quoting  the document on the cost of division. Will the Member be consistent and say  that the best way to reduce the cost of education is to not have the segregated  systems that we have?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  I cannot agree with the Member on that point. He will remember that, on a  number of occasions at the Education Committee, I traced the history of the  segregated system in Northern    Ireland. He will also remember what I said  about Lord Londonderry&rsquo;s attempts to establish a non-segregated system and about  who opposed him and introduced the segregated system. I am sure that I do not  have to give the Member a further history lesson.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP is very much in favour of parental choice, be that  for maintained, controlled, integrated or Irish-medium education. If parents  want choice, we have to pay for it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I support the motion and Members&rsquo; comments about it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Times are indeed hard for most people in the Province. In  the United Kingdom  as a whole, the economy is expected to decline by 3&middot;5% in 2009, with a slight  recovery possibly this time next year. We are all asking what that means for  the Province, and I will address that point.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am informed by the Department of Finance and Personnel  that the Chancellor has confirmed that an additional &pound;5 billion in efficiency  savings will apply to the devolved Administrations. That means that our block  grant will be reduced by some &pound;122&middot;8 million this year. However, the potential  impact of that is offset by the allocation of Barnett consequentials of &pound;116  million over this year and the next. That is a serious situation, and I am not  taking away from it, but it is not all doom and gloom.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">What does all that mean in layman&rsquo;s terms to you, me and  our constituents? It means that not much money is available; we all know that.  We must tighten our belts considerably; we all know that as well. We cannot  expect that we will get money to meet all our wants in each Department; indeed,  nor will we.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Above all, it means that we must show wisdom in the manner  in which we spend money in each Department to ensure that each pound that is  spent is put to the best use. The current financial position means that the  only way that more resources can be allocated to a particular service is to  scale back other public services. That is robbing one service to pay for  another. For that reason, each Department must plan and allocate funding  carefully according to priorities and needs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Tha Mannyistar haes wrought wi&rsquo; caer tae mak shair tha best  uis o&rsquo;tha shair oot tha mony tae each Depertmunt, an haes wrought oan brinin  aboot as much setisfactry effecht as poasibel.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has worked carefully to ensure the best use of  money in the distribution to each Department, and he has tried to ensure as  high a level of efficiency as possible.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, the position on the Executive&rsquo;s expenditure  plans, which are grounded in the Programme for Government, is dynamic and  fluid. Other Members mentioned that the programme&rsquo;s number one priority is  economic growth. They indicated that they support that and wish it to continue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In particular, although Whitehall Departments&rsquo; three-year  expenditure plans have remained largely unchanged since October 2007, spending  plans for Northern Ireland Departments in 2008-09 have, as part of the in-year  monitoring process, been reviewed on four occasions in light of the most  up-to-date, available information. Clearly, work has been done. That approach  will continue during 2009-2010 as part of the forthcoming June monitoring  round. We are keeping up to date and on top of monitoring to ensure value for  money and to make change as and when it is needed. Certainly, the Minister and  his Department work hard to ensure that the Province receives as much money as  possible.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At the same time, I must point out that the Finance Minister  can only direct money towards Departments; he does not earmark money for  individual projects. That is the responsibility of individual Ministers. The  onus is on them to ensure the proper distribution of funds on the ground. There  is a need to ensure that funding is not wasted on processing schemes through  the system and that the process is sufficiently efficient to ensure that as  much money as possible goes to schemes and, subsequently, to the people who  need it. That is no easy task.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Wearing my other hat as a member of my local council, I am  aware of the background work that goes into every decision, every paper that  must be researched, and every in-depth inquiry that must be carried out.  Departments must ensure that that work is carried out as efficiently as  possible so that more funding for projects is secured.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have considered the SDLP&rsquo;s proposed Budget, some of which  would certainly be beneficial if it were taken on board. However, I also see  that it is not a solution in itself. It contains a number of factual  inaccuracies, and some of its goals cannot be realised within our current  timescale. I have every confidence that the Minister will take on board and  incorporate the parts that are of benefit and use to the entire Province.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although the situation is not a crisis, it must be  monitored. I have faith that my colleague Nigel Dodds and his spokesperson in  the debate, Arlene Foster, will ensure that we survive the economic downturn  and see the beginnings of the shoots of prosperity. Although there are major  problems, it is important that we understand that the dawn is coming. In the  meantime, we must ensure that each and every Department takes on board the  concepts of efficiency and priorities so that they can pull us through.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Through his Department, Minister Dodds has done a good job  in difficult circumstances. I know that he will continue to monitor the  situation and ensure that Departments get all the funding that is available.  People on the ground need to see Departments choose what to spend the money on  wisely. I challenge every Minister, Committee Chairperson and Committee to get  that money on the ground and to let people see a difference. I support the  motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: The debate has been good. It raised many issues, which was to  be expected. I have noted those issues, and I will try my best to deal with  them. Clearly, if there is anything that I do not deal with, or that I am unable  to deal with, I will, undoubtedly, be reminded during tomorrow&rsquo;s debate. I hope  that I will be able to deal with any such issue during that debate, if not  during these closing remarks.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At the outset, I acknowledge confirmation by the  Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and Personnel that there has been  appropriate consultation with his Committee on the public-expenditure proposals  that are reflected in the 2009-2010 Main Estimates, the Supply resolution and  the related Budget (No.2) Bill. As a result of that confirmation, the Budget  (No.2) Bill that I will introduce shortly will proceed under accelerated  passage, which will exclude Committee Stage. On Mr Dodds&rsquo;s behalf, I appreciate  the Committee for Finance and Personnel&rsquo;s assistance and action on the matter,  which will help to ensure the seamless continuation of public-service delivery  throughout the coming year.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, I will try as far as possible to address the  issues that various Members raised, and if I miss any, I am sure that I will be  reminded of that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The first issue that I want to address is the limitation of  monitoring rounds, which many Members raised, not least Dr Farry and Mr O&rsquo;Loan.  I must say that Members are too dismissive of the monitoring process, which is  an important tool for the Executive in the strategic management of the  public-expenditure position.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Hamilton pointed out that the monitoring process has  facilitated more than &pound;1 billion of changes in departmental allocations in the  past two years. Mr Beggs questioned the purpose of monitoring rounds without  reallocations. I want to put him straight: there have been &pound;1 billion of  reallocations since the restoration of the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Does the Minister acknowledge that it is better to plan funding so that money  is not spent hastily near the end of a financial year? Does she agree that such  an approach would achieve better value for money?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: Absolutely. However, the flexibility of the monitoring round  allows us to reallocate if necessary, and Ministers have used in-year  monitoring to reallocate money to Departments. Where original programmes or  projects have encountered difficulties, or where costs have decreased rather  than lay idle, the money can be redirected into the economy. That approach has  facilitated substantial redirecting of money, not least &pound;22&middot;5 million for the  fuel poverty scheme, &pound;26&middot;5 million for housing programmes, &pound;20 million for the  farm-nutrient management scheme and almost &pound;10 million for minor capital  projects. Members should not dismiss those significant developments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and Personnel  mentioned the review of in-year monitoring. In March 2008, the Executive agreed  that there should be a review of how the Executive and the Assembly conduct the  Budget processes. We listened to the concerns of Members and the Committee for  Finance and Personnel on those processes. The Committee provided valuable and  substantive input into that review and incorporated comments from other  Committees. Similarly, a review of the in-year monitoring process has been  undertaken, and as the Chairperson said, the evidence-gathering stage of both  reviews has largely been completed. I understand that officials will soon bring  the emerging position to the Minister of Finance and Personnel for his  consideration, after which the various Committees, not least the Committee for  Finance and Personnel, will consider the matter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member also raised some issues about capital delivery.  I will offer two points in response. First, as he highlighted, we face a  difficulty owing to the lower level of capital receipts. Although that was an  issue last year, its impact was largely managed through the in-year monitoring  process. The best illustration of that success is that the Department for  Social Development, with Executive support, delivered 1,365 new housing units  last year against a milestone of 1,500. That performance leaves the Department  well on track to meet its Programme for Government target of 10,000 units over  five years. The current economic climate, as bad as it is, will not last for  ever, and assets that we cannot sell today will be retained for future  disposal. Secondly, the current state of the construction market provides an  opportunity to procure capital projects at lower costs. Mike Smyth and Mark  Bailey&rsquo;s much-quoted report, which I had the opportunity to read at the  weekend, picked up on that point.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Rev William McCrea, the Chairperson of the Committee for  Agriculture and Rural Development, spoke about farming issues. I am grateful  for his recognition of the funds that have been provided to the Department of  Agriculture and Rural Development for the farm-nutrient management scheme and  to support the fishing industry. The farm-nutrient management scheme is a  long-term investment in farm infrastructure that is essential for EU compliance  and to create an environmentally sustainable future. However, we need to  support and assist our farmers, and he made the point, very forcibly, that farmers  are investing a great deal of their own money in the industry. That point must  be acknowledged.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McNarry made several points about the Budget process and  said that the Department of Finance and Personnel does not accept bids during  the June monitoring round. He has either been misinformed about or has  misunderstood &mdash; Members can take their pick &mdash; the scope of the June monitoring  round.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Departments have been asked to submit spending bids in this  monitoring round as they would in any other year. As always, the Executive will  determine the way forward only when all the evidence on the bids has been  collected and analysed. I understand that some considerable bids have still to  be dealt with.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The level of funding for the Budget plans for 2011-12 and  beyond, which will be available to the Executive in the form of the block  grant, will be confirmed only as part of the next UK-wide spending review,  which is not expected until some time next year. Some very rash assertions were  made about funding cuts, the best examples of which were made during the  debates on the previous Budget, when similar fears were largely overblown. Once  again, that highlights the folly of rushed and ill-informed judgements on  Budget proposals, which Mr McNarry continues to make. Some people never learn,  and he is clearly not in a position to listen to what is happening. Just as he  has still not grasped the concept of Budget proposals, he has not grasped the  concept of a four-party mandatory coalition. The Executive are comprised not of  two parties but four.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  And Jim Allister.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: Jim Allister is not in the Executive, funnily enough. The  do-nothing Executive to which Mr McNarry referred have two Ulster Unionist  Ministers. What an indictment that is of those two Ministers, if that is what  Mr McNarry thinks that they are at. As for deceit, Mr Deputy Speaker, hypocrisy  knows no bounds from Mr McNarry. I am sorry that he is not here to hear my  remarks, but no doubt he will read them in the Hansard report and respond  tomorrow. For the record, however, I will not take any lectures from a man who  was a special adviser to David &ldquo;No guns, no Government&rdquo; Trimble.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  You supported him in his leadership bid.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>:  I was on my honeymoon during one David Trimble&rsquo;s leadership bid. I enjoyed my  time in Cyprus  greatly, Mr Deputy Speaker. I had nothing whatsoever to do with that particular  gentleman&rsquo;s election.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Moving on, which I am glad to do, I want to deal with some  of Mr O&rsquo;Loan&rsquo;s comments about the difficult financial situation that we are in.  There is no denying that the financial environment has become more difficult,  and, unfortunately, it will become even more challenging. However, Mr O&rsquo;Loan is  simply wrong to suggest that efficiency savings are the cause of our  difficulties. It is only by making savings in existing services that  Departments will be able to meet spending pressures. I heard Mr O&rsquo;Loan say that  civil servants gave me a cut-and-paste speech that was written 18 months ago.  If that is the case, I do not know how I could have given details of up-to-date  expenditure such as that for the new hospital for the south-west in  Enniskillen. He should not judge others by his tactics of cutting and pasting  speeches to make in the Assembly. Not every Member does what he does.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Those of us who were out and about during the European  election campaign know that the Civil Service equal-pay claim is an important  issue. Mr O&rsquo;Loan, and Mr Attwood in particular, said that the desire to deal  with the equal-pay claim is clear to us all. I was disappointed by Alex  Attwood&rsquo;s attack on Simon Hamilton for withdrawing an amendment to the motion  on the equal-pay issue on 1 June. He attacked Peter Weir, which he is entitled  to do, but he should have thought better of following that up with a snide  attack on Simon Hamilton, whose intention in with&shy;drawing his amendment was to  avoid dividing the House.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Civil Service equal-pay claim involves very complex  issues, and a great deal of work remains to be done before the matter can be  resolved. The Minister of Finance and Personnel met NIPSA representatives on 7  May to hear at first hand the union&rsquo;s issues of concern and to assure them of  his commitment to resolving the matter, if possible through a negotiated  settlement, without the need for litigation. As we all know, the only people  who benefit from litigation are the lawyers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is necessary to reach a negotiated settlement, and that  is still the desire of the Executive. A review of technical support grades is  being undertaken to ensure that posts are correctly graded, and to provide a  firm foundation for resolving the matter. Discussions are continuing;  therefore, it would be inappropriate for me to go into any more detail at this  stage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr O&rsquo;Loan and Mrs Hanna mentioned the SDLP Budget  proposals, as did others. They are a welcome contribution to the debate on the  handling of public expenditure. The proposals have been examined by the  Department of Finance and Personnel, and by Ministers of other Departments.  However, it is important to recognise that there are flaws in that analysis, as  have been mentioned, and that the proposals require significant development  before they could be considered for further implementation. Furthermore, some  of the proposals to generate funds for reallocation may not be deliverable in  the next two years; for example, additional asset sales. It should also be  recognised that there are deeper flaws in respect of the amounts that are  identified as being available from Invest NI and the Port of Belfast.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Many Members mentioned the impact of the loss of Workplace  2010 receipts. The potential of &pound;175 million from Workplace 2010 receipts was  factored into the plans for 2008-09. However, the loss of those receipts was  managed through the in-year monitoring process. Lower construction costs also  provided an opportunity for Northern Ireland Departments to procure capital  projects at lower cost.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I made the point that &pound;175 million was not  delivered last year, and that was a real loss. That meant that capital schemes  that should have been funded from that money did not go ahead. Does the  Minister accept that?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment: I  accept that we were able to manage that through the in-year monitoring process  &mdash; the same process that is being attacked by Members across the Floor who say  that it is not adequate to deal with issues that come up during the year. We  used that process to deal with the loss of that contract. As the Member is  aware, the reasons why the project was not completed were external, and did not  represent a failure by the Executive to proceed with it. It was simply the case  that both contractors who were involved in the competitive tendering process  joined together, and as a result, there was no competitive tendering. That was  the issue, and we could not proceed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On the one hand, Stephen Farry complains that nothing has  been done about the economic downturn; he then raises concern that the measures  that have been adopted have not been baselined. That is a disparity. He also  said that we compare unfavourably with the rest of the United Kingdom.  That is simply not the message that Nigel Dodds gets when he speaks to  colleagues in Wales and Scotland. We  are the first devolved region to deliver such a programme as a short-term aid  scheme to help people in business. Sometimes, the Members opposite indulge in a  bit of glass-half-empty rather than glass-half-full thinking. We are  effectively dealing with the issues that are before us, particularly those that  the business community wants us to deal with.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member also raised the concern that funds have been  allocated to pressures other than the economic downturn &mdash; I think he used the  term &ldquo;populist&rdquo; &mdash; but we should ensure that sufficient resources are made  available for all public services. I am sure that the Member would accept that,  in tough economic times, support for the vulnerable is just as important as  hard-nosed economic initiatives.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Dr Farry also suggested that we should not offset the  reduction in funding for 2010-11 as a result of the additional efficiency  savings through the use of Barnett consequentials. However, he provided no  indication as to how he would bridge the resulting funding gap that would  remain, other than to make non-specific reference to the costs of division  again. There are undoubtedly some additional costs associated with a somewhat  segregated society. I do not think that anyone would deny that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member for North Antrim Mr Storey talked about the  costs of our segregated education system. However, as has been made clear  previously, the suggested savings are sometimes overblown, and would also  involve job cuts. That would not be achievable in the short term.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">He also mentioned the tension between policies that look at  stimuli and having to deal with a debt burden, which was a fair comment. When  do we move from trying to create stimuli to dealing with the debt that we have  as a result of those stimuli? That was a question that I had to ask when I  looked at the short-term aid scheme. I asked whether it was worth doing it at  the time and decided that we had to do something to help businesses in need.  The scheme is time-limited and will end in 2010. We hope that the upturn will  have arrived by that stage and that we will be able to make use of the skills  that we were able to save in companies.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Fra McCann, Roy Beggs and Alex Attwood mentioned social  housing, as did other Members. Over the past five years, the number of social  houses completed per capita has been almost a third higher in Northern Ireland than in the UK as a whole.  Similarly, total housing completions per capita were 160% greater in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members also referred to the report by Mike Smyth and Dr  Mark Bailey. Although that report attempts to provide an assessment of the  monetary and non-monetary benefits of investment in social housing, its content  and conclusions clearly reflect that it was commissioned by DSD. That is  something that Members should consider very carefully when reading the report&rsquo;s  analysis. Any Department can commission its own consultants to prove the case  for additional funding; I am sure that Departments have done so in the past and  will do so in the future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, the underlying analysis in the report is  rather sparse. Evidence for the construction sector as a whole is based on data  for Scotland  that are five years old. In addition, the evidence in support of investment in  social housing relies on a single study from 2003, which, again, was based on  the position in Scotland.  Therefore, although the report adds to the debate, it is not particularly  applicable to Northern    Ireland or informative in the current  economic climate.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  Does the Minister share my sense of irony that the SDLP Minister with  responsibility for housing has commissioned a report by consultants to try to  prove her point when her party&rsquo;s proposals for the public finances in Northern Ireland  refer to doing away with consultants to a large degree?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Minister of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment: I am sure that that point will be put to that Minister in  due course.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to talk about the &pound;110 million easement that Mr  McCann mentioned.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  There is considerable experience and knowledge in our university system, which  is available to the public sector at considerably less cost than traditional  methods of consultancy. If Departments were to avail themselves of that  knowledge and experience, it would be very beneficial and considerably more  cost-effective than taking our present routes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Minister of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment: That is something that I intend to look at this week; I  plan to meet economists from our local universities and take the very route  that the Member mentioned.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McCann and Mr Attwood referred to the &pound;110 million  easement in respect of the Royal Exchange project. The Social Development  Minister has not yet formally identified that money for reallocation by the  Executive. The Royal Exchange project will also provide additional business and  work for the construction industry. The decision is one for the Social  Development Minister, but, as Mr McCann said, social regeneration is also an  issue. Therefore, the question is whether the Minister wants to transfer funding  for the project to housing or whether she wants to continue with the  regeneration. That is her decision, and we can have a discussion around the  Executive table about the reallocation of that money.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  There has been a bit of mischief-making about the DSD report that was acquired  by Margaret Ritchie. However, there can be no mischief-making about what Mrs  Foster&rsquo;s colleague Mr Dodds said. He said that building less social housing in  a recession had &mdash; to use not mine or Margaret Ritchie&rsquo;s but Nigel Dodds&rsquo;s words  &mdash; a materially disproportionate effect on the construction industry. Given that  the evidence, not from Scotland, Wales or England but from Northern Ireland, is  that the construction industry has suffered more than any other sector of our employee  base &mdash; the Minister knows that because of her DETI background &mdash; how can she not  join up the dots and draw the conclusion that investment in housing materially  benefits the construction industry, as well as all the broader uplifts that  would come to society?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Minister of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment: It is not that I am not joining up the dots. We all  recognise the value of social housing, and those points were made in the report  by Mr Smyth and Mr Bailey about homelessness, social exclusion and other  issues. However, the report skews the evidence to argue for social housing  over, for example, public transport and roads infrastructure. Homelessness will  not have as high a rating for public transport and roads infrastructure as it  does for housing. There are other areas of construction that I urge Members to  consider. We need a full and open debate, not just a consultants&rsquo; report that  was commissioned by the Department for Social Development to argue its case for  social housing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Nelson McCausland raised the issue of safety at sports  grounds and the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure&rsquo;s opening capital  budget for 2009-2010 of &pound;29 million for stadia development. The Culture  Minister has reallocated &pound;22 million of that to accelerate projects in sport  and in other sectors. It is my understanding that those accelerated projects,  including those relating to safety at sports grounds, will be taken forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also welcome the Member&rsquo;s emphasis on the need for  support for sport and tourism, areas that are close to my own heart. Tourism is  a growth area, and the Executive are always aware of the need to keep it high  on the agenda. It is gratifying that the relative peace in our community  facilitates further concentration on it. As the Minister with responsibility  for tourism, I assure Mr McCausland that I will not be found wanting in pushing  ahead with tourism infrastructure.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Roy Beggs highlighted the need for more public spending and  spoke about balancing the books, directly contradicting his colleague Mr  McNarry, who talked about a black hole. It is hard to see the meeting of those  positions. However, there is no denying that the financial environment has  become more difficult and will, unfortunately, be more challenging,  particularly if we face cuts from a Tory Government should David Cameron become  the next Prime Minister. However, the Member is wrong to suggest that  efficiency savings are the cause of those difficulties. It is only by making  savings in services that Departments will meet spending pressures. Surely the  Member recognises that the Executive can best support the economy during the  downturn by delivering on the commitments in the Programme for Government.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Last year, we had the highest levels of funding for public  services, as well as record capital investment, providing support to the  construction sector. Further&shy;more, Mr Beggs&rsquo;s pessimistic view of the economy  contradicts reports in the &lsquo;Financial Times&rsquo; that most City economists think  that the UK  economy has begun its recovery. Although the Member is right that public  finances will be more constrained, regardless of which party is in control  after the next general election, the challenges will be much worse under a  Conservative Government than under the current Labour Administration.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member spoke about Budget pressures. The main Budget  pressure facing the Executive this year is that the Department of Agriculture  and Rural Development has said that the capital receipt from the disposal of  the Crossnacreevy site will not now be delivered. However, that and other  shortfalls in capital receipts should be compensated for by slippage on other  projects.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Another potential pressure is the impact on Northern Ireland  of the additional efficiency savings that are expected to be made in UK  Departments. However, the outcome of the 2009 Budget was not as bad as some had  predicted. Additional allocations largely offset the reductions made through  the Barnett consequentials. Therefore, most of the known pressures that the  Executive face should be absorbed as part of the in-year monitoring process.  However, the House must note that major uncertainties remain in respect of  domestic water and sewerage and the NICS equal pay scheme.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate that there are also concerns about the  performance of Land and Property Services. Many of those concerns resulted from  the change to the rating system that occurred at the same time as services were  shifted to that agency. The Minister of Finance and Personnel has asked the  performance and efficiency delivery unit to conduct a review in collaboration  with Land and Property Services. The aim of that review is to provide assurance  that the agency is structured and managed in a way that focuses on the delivery  of its important objectives. The team is framing its final conclusions and is  due to report back shortly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am sorry that Mr Beggs is not here. I listened carefully  as he spent considerable time talking about double-jobbing and how people  cannot be in two places at once. I look forward to his resignation either from  this place or from his council position, because the logic of his argument  dictates that he cannot hold both those positions. Indeed, one would have  thought that Mr Beggs, of all people, would be careful about making such  statements. His father was MP for East Antrim,  a Member of the Northern Ireland Assembly between 1982 and 1986, a councillor  and an active farmer &mdash; all at the same time. Despite that, Mr Beggs comes into  the Chamber and speaks about double-jobbing and how people cannot be in two  places at the one time.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mrs Hanna wanted to speak about redundancy payments in  light of the Audit Office&rsquo;s report on the Department of Health, Social Services  and Public Safety. I appreciate the Member&rsquo;s concerns about the cost of  redundancy payments made to senior staff following the reorganisation of the  Health Service. However, we must respect the rights of the senior and  lower-paid staff who are being made redundant as part of efficiency-driven  reorganisation. The Member must also bear in mind that the redundancy payments  will bear fruit in the longer term, by producing much-needed efficiencies that  can be reinvested into front line health services. That is something that I  would consider to be a longer-term aim for the House.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I fully agree with Mrs Hanna that the focus should be on  outcomes and quality of service and that there must not be a slash-and-burn  attitude to efficiency savings. It must be taken on board that Committees have  a clear role in ensuring that savings are made through doing things better  rather than through making crude cuts.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Jennifer McCann, perhaps unsurprisingly, said that the  Executive should be given the full range of fiscal powers. Northern Ireland does very well as a consequence  of being a full part of the United    Kingdom. Full fiscal autonomy from the UK is not a  risk-free option, and that needs to be addressed by the people who propose it.  Indeed, the latest figures indicate that there is a &pound;6&middot;7 billion gap between  the tax revenue that is generated here and public expenditure. The Member might  want to consider how she would manage such a Budget deficit were we to have  full fiscal autonomy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member also mentioned public procurement, which arises  again and again as a matter of concern. In December 2008, the Minister of  Finance and Personnel established the construction industry forum procurement  task group to agree the principles to be applied to future construction  procurement. The group&rsquo;s report was finalised on 30 April and was tabled at the  procurement board on 7 May. The Finance Minister has instructed Central  Procurement Directorate to work with all government construction clients to  implement the seven key principles agreed by the task group, one of which is to  provide recurrent tender opportunities for enterprises of all sizes.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Centres of procurement expertise are required to advertise  all construction procurement opportunities that are in excess of designated  thresholds on their websites or in the local press. The procurement board  approved the use of the eSourcing NI web portal as a single sourcing tool for  all centres of procurement expertise. The portal offers all registered  construction firms 24/7 access to view all procurement opportunities and  facilitates the submission of electronic tenders.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Recently, a hospital in my own area of the south-west held  a successful open day for local contractors, which was facilitated by Invest  Northern Ireland.  It was a hugely successful event and indicates what can be achieved locally if  we put our minds to the issue of procurement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr O&rsquo;Loan and Dr Farry mentioned the green economy, which  is one of the key growth areas for us. It is one of the reasons why I set up  the interdepartmental working group on sustainable energy. The working group  has met on a number of occasions, and a subgroup has been set up to examine  green jobs. I am hopeful that we will see a lot of progress in that area.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Alex Attwood asked me a number of questions, and I hope  that I have answered one or two of them already. He asked me about the review  of senior Civil Service pay and bonuses, which was announced by Nigel Dodds  only last Thursday. I have no doubt that he will want to say more on the whole  procedure and on the leadership of the review. My colleagues are discussing the  issue, and the terms of reference may well be extended, as they are not set in  stone. However, Executive Ministers will discuss the issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to Queen&rsquo;s University, Belfast, and its 10% cut  in funding as reported in &lsquo;The Irish News&rsquo;, the allocation to the Executive in  relation to public bodies, such as Queen&rsquo;s University, is in line with the UK&rsquo;s  public expenditure system. However, despite some forecasts that the wider  economic position in 2012-13 will be known, we have public expenditure plans  only up to March 2011.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  First, I want to acknowledge that the Minister indicated that the Senior  Salaries Review Body&rsquo;s terms of reference may extend beyond the Civil Service.  If that were to happen, it would be timely, and it would be a good development.  However, the Minister indicated that what happens after 2011 is yet to be  determined, even though a public body in Northern Ireland appears &mdash; I stress  the word &ldquo;appears&rdquo; &mdash; to be making proposals, including making up to 300 staff  redundant, because of what informed sources tell them may be the position from  2012-13. It is a concern when a publicly funded body in Northern Ireland  appears to be making decisions based on figures that it believes to be the  case, even though those figures are not in the public domain and are not even  known to our Ministers. Surely there needs to be a conversation with that  public body about what it is doing.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Minister of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment: I am sure that the Member will take the issue up with the  Minister for Employment and Learning. However, on the basis of what we know, I  can offer no clarification of the item that appeared in Saturday&rsquo;s edition of  &lsquo;The Irish News&rsquo;. If you wish to take the matter up with the relevant Minister,  I am sure that he will endeavour to find out the answer for you.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairperson of the Committee for Education, Mr Storey,  raised the issue of schools funding in the latter part of the debate, and Mr  Bradley took the matter on. I recognise the Member&rsquo;s call for additional  funding for schools. However, we need to recognise that, overall, schools  funding is set to increase by 5&middot;9% this year, which is significantly greater  than the average for other public services. The Member will also be aware that,  as part of the December monitoring round, an additional allocation of &pound;4  million was made for school maintenance to the Department of Education.  However, as the Member will know, that is primarily a matter for the Minister  of Education, who has a considerably large budget. In fact, that Department  receives the second-highest level of funding.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am aware that there is at least one question of Mr  Attwood&rsquo;s that I have not answered. I am not in a position to answer his  question on childcare today, but, if he will be in the House tomorrow, I will  endeavour to find the answer for him by then. Members have a considerable  interest in childcare, as do I, as Mr Attwood mentioned.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank Members for their contributions to the debate. I  acknowledge their genuine concern and their desire to fund many needy projects and  programmes. However, as has been said many times, my colleague the Minister of  Finance and Personnel does not have a bottomless pit of money from which to  draw. The extent to which specific pressures in one area will be addressed is  contingent on the level of reduced requirements declared by other Departments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I commend the Supply resolution to the House. I remind  Members of the importance of today&rsquo;s vote. It is vital that public services  continue seamlessly in 2009 and 2010, and I ask all Members to support the  motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Before proceeding to the Question, I remind Members that the  motion requires cross-community support.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved (with cross-community support):</p>
