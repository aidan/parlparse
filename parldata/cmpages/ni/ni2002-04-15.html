              local residents as good reasons for opposition to the mast. I

              for children travelling to and from school (1/01R) and calls on
              the Minister of the Environment to ensure urgent evaluation and to
              take full account of the recommendations.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some might think that it has taken a long time,
              or too long, for the motion to come before the House, given that
              the Committee’s report was published in September 2001. I will
              deal with the reasons for the delay later.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I acknowledge that a motion on school buses was
              debated and agreed on 19 February 2002. Although I found parts of
              that debate interesting — especially the then Minister’s
              contribution, to which I will refer later — I considered it to
              be only a preliminary to today’s proceedings. I say that without
              disrespect to any Member. That debate was important, but my
              Committee’s recommendations take it a step further.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will provide a background to the inquiry and
              an overview of the recommendations, and I will then deal with what
              has happened, or rather, what has not happened, since. I intend to
              give an honest, concise and open account so that no one will doubt
              the integrity and sincerity with which the Committee dealt with
              the serious issue of safety on school buses.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The matter was first raised with officials from
              the Department of the Environment in January&nbsp;2000. In the
              light of the information that the Committee received about the
              dangers of overloading school buses, it decided on 8 June 2000 to
              make that the subject of its first public inquiry.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Following the public announcement of the
              inquiry, the Committee received 57 written representations. Those
              were from not only Government Departments and associated bodies,
              but from parents, a significant number of school principals, and
              even a school bus driver who had been transferred after
              questioning the practices of an education and library board.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the benefit of any Member who questions the
              seriousness of the situation and the need to take immediate
              action, I will quote from just two submissions to the Committee,
              all of which are documented in the report. The first is from the
              mother of a child who travels from Saintfield to Belfast every
              day:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;I do find it difficult to believe that my
              daughter has no rights to travel safely to and from school … she
              usually does not complain. However, today, when she arrived home
              bruised, grazed and so sore from being flung against the seat when
              the bus braked severely … she did tell me. Only three weeks into
              the term she already dreads the ordeal of the bus.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second submission is by the principals of
              two schools in Limavady, which states that some buses are
              overcrowded:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Some buses in our area are allocated up
              to 90 pupils.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, it reports that children have to
              stand on a crowded bus for journeys of up to 18 miles. The
              submission also refers to the intimidation of some drivers:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The task of a school bus driver becomes
              impossible with 80+ pupils in a 54 seater bus, trying to drive
              along the Limavady/Derry road at rush hour!&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the report was published, some accused the
              Committee of being overemotional about the value of a child’s
              life. I challenge them to respond to the mother of the schoolchild
              who came home battered and bruised, or to those principals who
              have to teach children who have had to stand for long periods on
              crowded buses before they even get to school.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some people went as far as to criticise the
              Committee for using the phrase &quot;a disaster waiting to
              happen&quot;. However, I remind the House that that phrase did not
              originate with any member of the Committee; it came from evidence
              presented to the Committee by Ch Insp Hiller of the then RUC
              traffic branch. I will quote from what he said:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;It would only take one bus jam-packed
              with about a hundred children colliding with a heavy goods vehicle
              to make this a major issue. We now see it as a major issue and we
              hope that the Committee and the Assembly will give us legislation
              that is workable and enforceable.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The inquiry took some time, but the Committee
              wanted to give everyone an opportunity to put their point of view.
              Consequently, in addition to the 57 written submissions that the
              Committee received, it took oral evidence from 13 different
              sources, some of whom had to be brought back to give further
              evidence. When all the evidence was gathered, Committee members
              sat down with a team of experienced public sector transport
              specialist consultants, who address similar safety issues day in,
              day out, and we arrived at our recommendations. The report was
              published in September 2001 and therefore has already been with
              the Department of the Environment for nearly seven months.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee made 28 recommendations, many of
              which Members will note are not only detailed, innovative and
              challenging but go much further than the limited scope of the
              so-called school buses debate, which took place on 19 February. I
              will not go over all the recommendations, but they are grouped
              under headings such as: the &quot;3 for 2&quot; seating provision;
              schoolchildren standing on buses; seat belts; arrangements for
              getting on and off buses; signage; flashing lights; legislation
              governing the use of minibuses and coaches on organised trips;
              behaviour and vandalism issues; storage of equipment and baggage;
              and, not least, road safety education. Almost every aspect of
              travel to and from school was investigated and reported on in some
              detail. Unfortunately, time does not afford me the luxury of
              detailing every recommendation, but I will say that there is not
              one single recommendation that will not bring about the improved
              safety of our children travelling to and from school.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some recommendations, such as abolishing the
              &quot;3 for 2&quot; concession, standing on school buses and seat
              belt provision, have far-reaching implications, including
              significant resource implications, and the Committee acknowledges
              that. The Committee makes no apology for this, and if Members read
              the report carefully, they will see that the Committee accepts
              fully that all recommendations cannot be implemented overnight.
              However, that does not mean that they should not be evaluated
              properly and implemented. I do not accept that nothing can be done
              unless everything is lumped together.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I now turn my attention to the Department of
              the Environment’s initial response to the Committee on the key
              recommendations. Suffice it to say that the recommendations will
              not be evaluated until much later this year at the earliest, and
              even that is dependent on resources being secured in a monitoring
              round bid. By contrast, some other Departments that are involved
              directly in the report, such as the Department for Regional
              Development and the Department of Education, have acknowledged
              readily some time ago that some recommendations can be introduced
              at a relatively low cost and relatively quickly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What was the Committee’s approach in making
              the recommendations? Through extensive research, the Committee has
              faced up to the real problems with due consideration and
              pragmatism. For example, when it examined the serious problem of
              traffic overtaking buses while children are boarding and
              alighting, it recognised that there could not be a simple approach
              or solution for every road in Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is why the Committee decided that the
              banning of overtaking may be practical and necessary in some
              locations and was certainly worthy of further investigation. In
              tandem with that recommendation, the Committee also recommended
              that the Department of the Environment and the Department of
              Education should develop and publish a good practice guide in
              respect of risk surrounding boarding and alighting at, or adjacent
              to, school premises, to cover issues such as supervision, local
              traffic-calming measures, hazard signals and school bus signage in
              general. Are those measures so difficult to implement? Are they so
              expensive? How long do we have to wait before there is action on
              the recommendations? I mean action and not a vague commitment to
              review, with no specific timetable or output.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.15 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the debate on 19 February 2002 some
              Members expressed disappointment, some of it verging on criticism,
              that my Committee had not brought the report to the House earlier.
              Looking back now, I regret to say that my Committee’s trust in
              the Department of the Environment, with its lead responsibility
              — I repeat, its lead responsibility — for road safety, and in
              this case the safety of children on school buses, has proved to be
              misplaced.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last September the Committee took a deliberate
              decision to defer bringing forward the report, so that when it was
              debated, it would be in an atmosphere of moving forward with the
              recommendations, together with the Department of the Environment
              and other Departments, in the most positive and constructive way
              possible. The price we have paid for our decision is delay and
              prevarication by the Department of the Environment. It took
              precisely five months to get an initial response of any substance
              from the Department of the Environment. The words &quot;initial
              response&quot; were used by the then Minister of the Environment,
              and, curiously, that response arrived on 18 February 2002 — the
              day before the debate on the motion I have already mentioned.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At last week’s Committee meeting, one
              Committee member wondered whether he was paranoid or whether it
              was just coincidence that every time the Committee was about to
              act on something, the Department seemed to be able to produce
              long-awaited replies at the last minute.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I must inform the House that by early
              December 2001 my Committee had received extensive initial
              responses from the Department of Education, the Department for
              Regional Development, the Department for Employment and Learning
              and even from Translink. It took until late in February 2002 for
              the Department of the Environment to respond. When that was
              questioned, the then Minister took umbrage and wondered whether
              his Department’s efforts had been misplaced. Those efforts
              primarily included taking more than two months to collate
              information that the Committee had already received from the three
              other Departments. I would add that, for the benefit of Members,
              my Committee has lodged copies of the relevant correspondence with
              the Assembly Library, so that everyone can see and understand the
              Committee’s frustration since the report was published last
              September.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The criticism that my Committee has received
              from the former Minister of the Environment, and, most recently,
              from the current Minister, must be addressed. That criticism is
              centred on two supposed questions in a letter that the then
              Minister sent to the Committee in December 2001. On two occasions
              my Committee was specifically accused in the House of failing to
              give answers. My Committee totally rejects this attempt to divert
              the focus of attention away from the real issue of school
              transport.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The two alleged questions were suddenly
              referred to by the Minister of the Environment on 4 March 2002
              during Question Time. One relates to the evidence obtained by the
              Committee to justify the cost benefits of implementing the
              recommendations, and the other refers to where the money is to
              come from. I must say to the Minister that instead of relying on
              his officials, it would be a great step forward if he were to read
              the complete report for himself and not just the recommendations.
              He would then see all the justification he needs.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will say something about implementation cost
              projections in a moment. For example, on page 155 in volume 2 of
              the report there are statistics that have been provided by the
              police in relation to children who were injured or killed
              travelling to and from school between 1995 and 1999. During that
              period, 413 children were injured while travelling on buses,
              compared with 488 injured while travelling in cars. I will say no
              more on that subject.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second supposed question was about where
              the money was to come from. The former Minister accused me, and
              consequently my Committee, of resorting to emotive slogans.
              However, in his December letter, it is he who wrote about making
              difficult choices between the needs of hospital patients, the
              elderly, the disabled, the homeless, the unemployed and
              educational underachievers. In what is clearly a rhetorical
              question, he asks if the money would be better spent on the Health
              Service than on implemention of the Committee’s recommendations.
              What about emotive language?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee’s terms of reference focused
              the report on school bus safety. The Committee was not in the
              business of prioritising the Department’s budget, nor any other
              Department’s budget, to deal with the costs of implementing the
              report’s recommendations.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept the position outlined by the hon
              Member, but my Committee’s responsibility was to investigate the
              safety of our children travelling to and from school, not to
              allocate the Budget; that is the responsibility of the Executive
              and the Departments. We were simply and directly dealing with a
              specific issue in our investigation. In brief, our concern in this
              report was to bring out the evidence that was given to us and to
              develop recommendations to improve the safety of our children. Is
              that not a laudable position for any Committee to hold? Hard
              decisions must be made, but at least let us make those decisions
              based on the facts. The investigation was all about facts such as
              those documented in the Committee’s report — not side issues.
              We did not make the evidence; we simply took the evidence.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Road safety, and therefore the safety of our
              children travelling to and from school in buses, is the Minister
              of the Environment’s responsibility. Therefore, the Department
              of the Environment is responsible for ensuring full evaluation of
              all of the recommendations within this report and the
              co-ordination, monitoring and reporting of subsequent follow-up
              implementations, as appropriate.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of the Environment’s response
              in February promised regulatory impact assessment; reviews;
              research; and further research — without any reporting
              timescales. There has been no sign of action. As things stand, the
              regulatory impact assessment on the Committee’s key
              recommendations will not be completed by the end of this year.
              That is why the motion not only seeks the Assembly’s approval of
              the report, but calls specifically on the Minister of the
              Environment to ensure proper evaluation and to take full account
              of its recommendations.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank all of those who contributed to the
              report. I particularly acknowledge the perseverance and tolerance
              of my fellow Committee members, including those members who have
              moved on this since the report was completed. I also pay tribute
              to the Committee’s secretariat for its industry and attention to
              detail in the report’s preparation and delivery. I have great
              pleasure in commending the report to the House today. Rarely will
              we have a more serious issue before us than this one, and I ask

              motion.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on
              this important matter. I hope that the personal safety of all
              children while travelling on school buses, particularly when
              getting on and alighting from them, is a matter of concern to
              every Member of the House and to members of the Committee for
              Education.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue has been raised at several meetings
              of the Committee for Education, and I am pleased that both the
              Minister of the Environment and the Minister of Education are here
              today.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Education Committee welcomed the
              publication of the report on 13 September 2001 and acknowledges
              the Committee for the Environment’s detailed consideration of
              the matter. This debate is long overdue.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the most dangerous parts of the journey
              to school is when pupils board or alight from buses. On 19
              February the Assembly endorsed my motion noting the number of
              children who have been killed while getting on and alighting from
              school buses by motorists and called on the Executive to conduct
              an urgent investigation of measures to protect the welfare of
              children when using school buses, taking account of the relevant
              laws introduced in the United States of America.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In recognition of that, I urged the Executive
              to put in place pilot schemes in rural and urban areas of Northern
              Ireland to assess the impact of preventing motorists from
              overtaking school buses when children are getting on or alighting,
              and to see whether regulation through legislation, as applied in
              the United States of America, could be implemented here.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My motion recognised that school transport is a
              cross-cutting issue and is not the sole responsibility of any one
              Minister. Therefore, I am using this opportunity to urge the
              Executive to take a co-ordinated and cohesive approach involving
              the Minister of the Environment, the Minister of Education and the
              Minister for Regional Development to ensure that progress is made.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The importance of pupil safety cannot be
              overemphasised, and full consideration must be given to measures
              aimed at enhancing the care and protection of children being
              transported to and from school. While the Department of the
              Environment provides advice on the safety of pupils travelling on
              school buses, the Department of Education is responsible for
              policy on home-to-school transport, and services are arranged by
              the education and library boards.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many of the recommendations in the Committee
              for the Environment’s report will, if implemented, have a major
              impact on the education and library boards, and the Committee for
              Education has sought their views and those of the Department of
              Education.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of the recommendations could improve
              safety while not requiring major expenditure. Those include
              involving a means of communication for bus drivers and taxi
              drivers. The report also recommends the development of a code of
              conduct for everyone involved in home-to-school transport and the
              publication of a good practice guide on arrangements for getting
              on and off buses. The Committee for Education has been informed
              that the Department of Education and the education and library
              boards are taking appropriate action on those issues, and we look
              forward to progress on the matter.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also clear that some of the key
              recommendations, if implemented, will involve significant costs.
              Those include the abolition of the &quot;3 for 2&quot; seating
              arrangements, the provision of new seat belts and the prohibition
              of standing on school buses.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.30 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Examples of the estimated costs include an
              additional capital amount of approximately £41 million and an
              extra £22·5 million a year for additional running costs if the
              recommendations to abolish the &quot;3 for 2&quot; seating
              arrangement and standing on buses are implemented. Although that
              is largely a matter for Translink, the additional cost would
              undoubtedly be passed on to the education and library boards.
              Provision of new seat belts would require a large capital
              investment by the education and library boards of approximately
              £15 million, and ensuring that pupils complied with the
              legislation and wore the seat belts would present a practical
              problem.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Implementation of the recommendations would
              have an important impact on the already critical financial
              situation in education. The Committee for Education does not wish
              to see funds taken from the classroom, as schools already exist on
              limited resources. Every Member is aware of the poor standard of
              accommodation in the schools estate. Therefore, the Executive
              would have to provide extra funding. I seek assurances from the
              Chairperson of the Committee for the Environment and the Minister
              that any financial bid made by the Department of Education or the
              Committee for Education will receive the full backing of the
              Committee for the Environment.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given the heavy cost of implementing several of
              the Committee for the Environment’s recommendations, it is
              important that a cost-benefit analysis be carried out as quickly
              as possible. The next step, therefore, must be a clear evaluation
              of the recommendations so that long-term decisions can be properly
              made.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I endorse the motion in general and welcome
              this important debate. I look forward to hearing the contributions
              of Members including those who are members of the Committee for
              Education. I especially look forward to contributions from the
              Minister of the Environment and other relevant Ministers.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the motion and commend the
              Chairperson of the Committee for the Environment for moving it.
              The Committee has looked at all the key school transport issues. I
              agree with the Committee Chairperson: although this is a
              complicated issue, and progress is not a simple matter, that
              should not be a reason to delay the implementation of simple
              measures, some of which have been mentioned, to make boarding and
              alighting from school buses safer. I remind Members that the facts
              show that most fatal accidents happen when children are boarding
              or alighting from school transport.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for the
              Environment referred to the Department for Regional Development.
              However, the matter poses challenges for several Departments,
              including the Department of Education. It is important that the
              Committee’s report signals the need for those Departments to
              co-operate in the development of a strategy to tackle the issues
              that have been identified. An end to overcrowding on school buses
              would be most welcome.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to keep in mind the safety of all
              schoolchildren. While the priority is school transport, some
              children travel to school on foot or on bicycles, and there are
              dangers for them. In that regard, I want to talk about ending the
              &quot;3 for 2&quot; seating arrangement rule. While it appears to
              be a measure that can be implemented and, at face value, it
              appears to be fairly straightforward, the impact in rural areas
              must be carefully assessed, as there are cost implications. The
              Chairperson of the Committee for Education covered that ground,
              and he clarified the main points to everyone.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, there are entitlements to school
              transport, and there is a qualifying distance. As Members know
              from their constituents, the practicalities are that, where
              possible, education boards allow children who live within walking
              distance of their schools to travel on the school bus if it can
              take them. If a family has two children, and one child is at
              secondary school and the other child is at primary school, the
              secondary school child may qualify for school transport because he
              has to travel a greater distance. The parents may send the younger
              child to school with the older child, and it is difficult for the
              education board to instruct the school driver to pick up the older
              member of the family and not to take on board the younger member,
              who may be a four- or six-year-old.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we end the &quot;3 for 2&quot; arrangements,
              the qualifying limit will be applied very strictly. That will mean
              that more children will walk to school. As Members who represent
              rural constituencies know, that is a problem. It is also a problem
              in urban areas, and it will cause a great deal of worry for
              parents. Children who walk to school have to negotiate road
              junctions and cross busy roads — even in rural areas — and
              that throws up dangers. While the ending of the &quot;3 for
              2&quot; rule will help to alleviate the pressure on the school
              transport system and reduce overcrowding, more children will walk
              to school, because many families do not have access to school
              transport, and they cannot take their children to school. We have
              to keep the safety of all children in mind.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the Department for Regional
              Development, I emphasise the recommendation in the report about
              the need to bring all school bus routes into the winter gritting
              system. People who live in rural areas, quite rightly, claim that
              there are inconsistencies and inequalities in the system. It is
              difficult to disagree with those concerns, and improvements should
              be phased in before next winter. That would be consistent with
              what the Chairperson said about the key Departments moving now to
              advance the strategy and improve safety. As I said in a previous
              debate, the Department of Education should recommend that
              particular attention be paid in schools to the personal safety of
              all children who rely on school transport and use it daily.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a member of the Committee for the
              Environment, I support the motion. Given that the Minister has not
              implemented the ‘Report on the Inquiry into Transport used for
              Children Travelling to and from School’, which involved months
              of hard work, his commitment to the road safety of schoolchildren
              leaves a good deal to be desired. I take on board the fact that
              the Minister is new to the post; however, his Department shows a
              lack of interest in implementing the Committee’s recommendation
              that legislation be introduced to set minimum safety standards for
              vehicles that transport schoolchildren. I appeal to all the
              Departments involved to play a constructive role in implementing
              the report.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recognise the significant cost involved in
              implementing the Committee’s recommendation; however, what price
              can we put on a child’s life? That strong principle emerged from
              the evidence that the Committee received. No cost can justify the
              death or serious injury of any child travelling to or from school.
              Every Member has a copy of the report, which details fully the
              Committee’s recommendations, and I appeal to everyone to approve
              it. It is time to evaluate the 57 written representations to the
              Committee from service providers and other witnesses. In addition,
              I call on the Minister of the Environment to put into action the

              for it to reach the Floor. How long will it take to implement the
              important recommendations, or is it a question of how many more
              schoolchildren will be killed before action is taken?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for the
              Environment has already covered every aspect of this important
              subject, but I will mention a few of the main concerns and
              recommendations. Standing on school buses should be a thing of the
              past. On the Ards Peninsula, in my constituency of Strangford,
              particularly in September, it is almost a matter of how many
              youngsters can be squeezed onto a bus, and I am sure that that
              unacceptable practice is replicated throughout Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have seen schoolchildren standing against the
              door at the front of a bus. I pay tribute to bus drivers for
              keeping their buses on the roads in such circumstances. The A20
              from Portaferry to Newtownards, for example, is a winding road
              that runs adjacent to Strangford Lough. If a school bus were to
              collide or swerve anywhere on that road — and coastal erosion
              can happen in that area — the bus would topple into the lough,
              resulting in many young casualties. That could occur in many
              places in Northern Ireland, so standing on school buses must be
              done away with as soon as possible.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.45 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree that the &quot;3 for 2&quot; seating
              policy for children should be a thing of the past. Every pupil
              should be entitled to a seat, and a seat belt should be available.
              I understand that seat belts are already compulsory on many buses
              and coaches — private operators have accepted that policy. They
              must feel aggrieved that the public operators can get away without
              that safety provision. What is good for the private operator must
              be good for the public one.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Front and rear signage on school buses must be
              of paramount importance. Members of the Portaferry Women’s
              Institute suggested to the Environment Committee the possibility
              of enacting legislation to have traffic stop to the front and rear
              of school buses when children are alighting. The Chairperson of
              the Environment Committee and the Chairperson of the Education
              Committee also mentioned that. That idea was prompted by the
              unfortunate death of a pupil who had alighted from his school bus
              and crossed the busy road between Kircubbin and Portaferry. There
              are other sad instances. If young lives are to be saved, all
              proposals must be investigated as quickly as possible.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are many recommendations in the report,
              such as codes of conduct for all concerned; good practice guides
              for getting on and off school buses; and a reduction in vandalism,
              bullying, and so on. It is imperative for all the proper
              authorities to come together to grasp the nettle and put into
              practice actions that will mean that schoolchildren can travel to
              school in safety, even if those actions are implemented over a
              number of years. Costs will play a large part in the
              implementation of the Committee’s many recommendations. The
              question is: what price a child’s life?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I join the other Members who welcomed the
              report. It was enlightening to hear how the inquiry was conducted
              and to be aware of the delays, and I too must express my
              disappointment about that. It is not before time that the report
              has come out.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many of the 28 recommendations on child safety
              are extremely important, and the Women’s Coalition supports the
              motion’s call to deal with them as a matter of urgency.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will deal with some of the recommendations,
              but in reverse order. There are some valuable points in the report
              that have not been touched upon. First, I welcome recommendations
              16 and 20 that propose a strategy to deal with bullying, vandalism
              and bad behaviour. I assume that that would also include
              intimidation. The Committee’s recommendation that an action plan
              be drawn up to deal with these problems is a valuable one, as is
              the idea of setting up a telephone hotline to deal with incidents
              on school transport.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report mentions the amount of baggage that
              children must carry to school, and, as a mother, I am very aware
              of that. It is a difficult problem to deal with. Perhaps the
              Minister of Education could take on board the need to provide
              facilities in schools for storing books and equipment so that
              children would have less baggage to carry. In that context, space
              to store pupils’ bags should also be provided on school buses.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also welcome the idea of using yellow buses.
              There was an opportunity to examine how that system was introduced
              into the USA. According to recommendation 12, research into the
              yellow school bus system will be valuable with a view to possibly
              adopting it in Northern Ireland. The system seems to work well in
              many American states. Other recommendations with regard to the use
              of flashing lights, signage and road safety education are
              important.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As is my wont, I started with the soft issues,
              and I will move on to the difficult issues. The Committee’s
              proposals for dealing with standing on buses and seat belts are
              too lenient. It is inappropriate that timescales have been set for
              the introduction of seat belts, for example, over the short,
              medium and long terms. Seat belts for school buses should have
              been introduced yesterday. They should not be phased in.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members understand the Department’s concerns
              and its need to prioritise. There is a question about whether
              money should be given to the Health Service or to education. I was
              impressed by Mr McCartney’s point that a reduction in the number
              of accidents involving school buses would reduce pressure on the
              Health Service. The argument about where money should go does not
              stand up in that case.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Standing on buses should also have been dealt
              with yesterday. Parent-teacher associations have addressed the
              need for safety on school buses. Serious pressure should be
              applied to speed up the implementation of the report’s
              recommendations, if not yesterday, at least tomorrow.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee’s remit concerned the specific
              issue of safety on buses. However, the debate must be broadened to
              include safer routes to school, whether children travel on foot,
              by bicycle or by bus. For example, approximately 2% of children in
              the UK cycle to school, compared with 60% in Denmark. That is
              understandable, because a cyclist is 12 times more likely to be
              injured or killed in Northern Ireland than in Denmark.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We could also discuss children walking to
              school to avoid rush-hour traffic. However, that may be outside
              the remit of the debate. Perhaps the best example of a school bus
              is the &quot;walking&quot; bus, which is a pilot system that is
              being operated in north Down. There is no need for seat belts,
              because all the children walk to school. However, only children
              who live in close proximity to the schools can do that.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is an important debate. We must help two
              sections of the community to the best of our ability — the aged
              and the young. The motion deals with the children of Northern
              Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I understand it, at present a 53-seater bus
              can carry 101 children. That will not make them safe — just
              think of 101 children crammed into a 53-seater bus.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Something must be done as soon as possible.
              Otherwise, we are waiting for a calamity to happen. If a calamity
              happens, every voice will be raised. Every voice and every hand
              will be raised in horror that the Assembly tolerated such a
              system. The finances of the situation, as the Chairperson said,
              are not the responsibility of the Committee for the Environment.
              That matter will arise when the Budget is being distributed and
              when cries are being made for certain amounts of money to be put
              to certain good causes.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I trust that the Minister will not try to
              defend a 53-seater bus carrying 101 children, that he will admit
              that that cannot be tolerated and that he is prepared to do his
              best to remedy the situation. Some of the recommendations would
              take little or no money to put into operation. Why can the
              Minister not say, as an act of good faith, that he is going to
              seek the immediate implementation of that which does not put
              strain on his present budget? That would be an assurance to
              children, and to their parents, that a start was being made.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Seat belts are important. It is preached every
              night on television that not wearing a seat belt endangers not
              only oneself but others as well. However, the Assembly is prepared
              to tolerate a situation with school buses which completely ignores
              the facts that are being presented. The Minister can take a
              positive step forward by telling the House that, although finance
              is an issue, there are recommendations that do not demand large
              amounts of money — and perhaps some that do not require any —
              and that he is prepared to take steps to implement those
              immediately and progress to those others that are important.
              However, the Assembly must face up to the glaring fact that money
              will have to be spent on the problem. That cannot be avoided.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Friend, the Chairman of the Committee for
              the Environment, who presented the report, and the other Committee
              members must be congratulated on it. They have faced up to the
              situation. The hon Member for North Down, Ms Morrice, is not happy
              about parts of the report. She thinks that parts of it should have
              been implemented yesterday. I agree with that. The Assembly should
              never have let the situation get so far. However, we must face the
              facts.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have told the Minister that he can start his
              tenure well by assuring parents and children that he will do all
              that he can in the circumstances. There must be movement on this,
              and that movement must then be carried to a successful conclusion.
              The Minister will receive the plaudits of the people if he pursues
              that path. However, telling the Assembly that that is not possible
              because of finance and other things that need to be done is simply
              putting it off. I hope that the Minister will not put it off, but
              will announce that this is the day when action will be taken to
              address this serious problem.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr K Robinson:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fundamental point of principle in the
              debate is that nothing exceeds the value of human life. Indeed,
              the existence of the Assembly is based on the sanctity of human
              life after a 30-year war that saw the loss of so many innocent
              lives.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For that reason alone, we should place the
              protection of lives, especially young lives, at the top of our
              agenda.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.00 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In December 2001, two children were knocked
              down while alighting from school buses; both were young teenagers.
              Many lives have been blighted as a result of such accidents.
              Indeed, over many years, a series of such awful incidents have
              resulted in the loss of young lives. The tragedy is that they are
              all avoidable. The creation and enforcement of a simple set of
              traffic rules would considerably reduce the risk of such incidents
              recurring.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recently visited the United States, where I
              went to a school to observe how the authorities deal with what is
              a universal problem. In many states, school buses are painted
              yellow and are easily visible. They are fitted with bright
              flashing lights that operate when the vehicle is stationary. When
              those lights are flashing, no traffic is allowed to overtake the
              bus. That dramatically reduces the risk of child being hit by a
              car when alighting. Such lights are easily fitted and are already
              present on many vehicles. Furthermore, the expense is not
              extraordinary.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An extendable arm is another device used in the
              United States that significantly reduces the risk to children
              alighting from school buses. Normally forming part of the front
              bumper, the arm extends outwards, parallel to the footpath or
              roadside. It causes children to walk a considerable distance from
              the bus and reduces the opportunity for them to dash or walk out
              unwarily on to the road. Again, that measure is simple and easily
              fitted. Importantly, it could save lives.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not accept that the risk of greater
              traffic congestion as a result of these measures is an acceptable
              reason for doing nothing. Frankly, that argument belongs to the
              Stone Age. On balance, to save one human life is worth whatever
              minor traffic delay is caused. One would have to be a cynical,
              uncaring person to recommend inaction, simply because the measures
              might delay traffic somewhat.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In continental cities, vehicles automatically
              stop to allow a person to alight from, or board, a tram. Why could
              traffic here not automatically stop to allow children to enter or
              exit a school bus?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In America, mirrors on school buses that allow
              drivers to see children who are close to either the front or rear
              wheels are fitted extensively. That again reduces the risk at the
              point where children have lost their lives in the past.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The case appears clear-cut and simple. As an
              Assembly, we have reaffirmed the protection and preservation of
              human life as a paramount consideration. Therefore, we should
              recommend the adoption of the measures that I have outlined:
              brightly painted buses; buses with flashing lights that operate
              automatically when stopped; a ban on cars passing stationary buses
              when those lights are flashing; and an extendable arm fitted to
              bus bumpers to prevent children crossing close to the vehicle.
              That is a raft of simple measures, but they would go a long way to
              reducing what is currently an unacceptable risk.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recommendations 9, 12, 13 and 14 of the report
              go some way to highlighting the facts that I have mentioned.
              Recommendation 14 deals with the supervision, scheduling, queuing
              and signing systems, design of drop-off and pickup points, and
              local traffic calming. All those aspects are vital to create a
              mindset that this is a central issue that must be addressed by
              everyone: schools; transport companies; parents; and drivers of
              all other road vehicles. I am sorry to say that we are currently
              very glib in our approach to road safety. Recommendation 14
              focuses the attention of all who have a part to play in reducing
              what is a serious problem.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to draw attention to recommendation 19
              in the Committee’s report, which returns us to the core of the
              matter. Many incidents and accidents go unreported. The Committee’s
              recommendation that there should be a formal system of reporting
              such incidents and accidents is positive. That can better inform
              our way of addressing them within the schools, when parents come
              to collect their children, when children are about to cross the
              road and when other vehicles come upon a school bus.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend the report, and I congratulate the
              Committee and the Chairperson on their detailed and necessary
              work. We now rely upon the Minister and his officials to take the
              recommendations forward and build them into legislation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remind Members that a former Government
              Minister in this Building dared to be different in the past. He
              introduced the R-plate system specifically to address the problems
              that Northern Ireland’s newly qualified drivers were causing. I
              hope that the Minister today will follow that lead.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr A Doherty:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With his fixed, nice-guy smile and his anxious
              eyes, Tony Blair said &quot;education, education, education&quot;.
              I was quite impressed, even though it was election time, when
              dramatic slogans are highly valued and sometimes quite effective.
              Then I began to wonder — why education times three? Why not just
              education? Education is education. That is it. Then I wondered a
              bit more. Perhaps the champion of new Labour meant that there are
              three educations — education for the privileged, education for
              the ordinary and education for the underprivileged. If that was
              what he meant, he would be very much in tune with some people in
              this enlightened little place. However, I am sure that he did not
              mean that. I hope he did not mean that, although much of what he
              has done about education since he uttered that rousing call has
              been alarming.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You might ask what that has to do with the
              motion. It is simple. Like every other aspect of education, this
              is an issue of equality and human rights. All children have the
              right to an appropriate education, and I do not mean that it
              should be appropriate to their parents’ bank balances or their
              social standing. It follows that people who have a duty to provide
              education have a duty to ensure that children arrive safely, and
              in reasonable comfort, at their places of education — hence the
              great effort put into this inquiry by the Committee for the
              Environment. All the report’s recommendations are reasonable and
              achievable. There are cost implications, and we appreciate that
              there is competition with other areas of great need. However, a
              start must be made immediately, and much can be done at no great
              cost if the will is there.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I must emphasise that the inquiry deals with
              proposals to change transport arrangements that serve an education
              system which itself is in need of reform — a system which is in
              many ways an affront to equality and children’s rights. There
              are proposals to improve the system. Whatever comes from those
              proposals, the results must be far-reaching and right. If we mess
              it up — and I fear that we will — I will be long gone before
              there is another chance. Members might say that that will be no
              great loss. However, they and their children will also be gone.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not stray from the motion, for if we get
              the system right there will be bonuses with regard to school
              transport. For example, it is daft for hordes of children to
              travel 10 to 20 miles to school in one direction, meeting hordes
              of other children travelling in the opposite direction. Before
              anyone sneers about &quot;postcode schooling&quot;, I know that if
              neighbourhood schools are to be the norm, those schools must all
              be excellent, and every neighbourhood must be made tolerable. That
              is not the case at the moment, and that must be put right.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The principals of Limavady High School and St
              Mary’s provided the Committee with oral evidence. I know both
              gentlemen and their schools well. At paragraphs 551 and 554, Vol
              2, Appendix 4 of the report, Mr Bradley told the Committee that</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;In Limavady, we have pupils from a
              largely rural community travelling anything up to 18 miles - the
              distance from Strathfoyle to Limavady. It can be a long and
              arduous journey, taking 35 to 40 minutes, during the morning rush
              hour and, again, between 3.30 pm and 4.00 pm. Having 22 or 23
              young people standing for that time will lead to problems. In my
              paper, I mentioned misbehaviour, bullying, vandalism, and
              sectarian taunts and fights. In that respect, Limavady is no
              different from any other area. I stress that 95% or more of the
              pupils travelling on those buses are well behaved, but a small
              minority takes up an inordinate amount of our time and that of
              Translink.&quot;</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The first housing estate in Ballykelly is
              King’s Lane. The distance has been measured by Translink and the
              estate was found to be within the three-mile limit for Limavady
              High School and St Mary’s. The children do not get a free pass,
              and their parents must pay. Fortunately for those who attend
              Limavady Grammar School, which is slightly further up the road
              from us, the distance from King’s Lane to school exceeds the
              three-mile limit and children get a free pass.&quot;</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those are just two examples of situations that
              are strangers to the concepts of equality and children’s rights
              and are far removed from the acceptable standards of safe and
              comfortable travel. The report is full of such examples. I
              recommend that it be carefully studied. I support the motion.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McHugh:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the opportunity to speak about the
              report, and I commend the work that has brought it to completion.
              I also support the comments of the other Members who spoke about
              the delay of seven months during which nothing has happened. These
              recommendations that are not too costly should have been
              implemented, and all Members would like to see the full
              implementation of all the recommendations.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issues and the terms of reference that the
              Committee considered are accurate, and all Members agree with
              them. The groups that considered the key issues are listed in the
              report. The fact that so many people contributed to the report
              must not be ignored. We must not ignore the safety of children
              travelling to and from school; it is the most important element of
              the debate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I notice that my Colleague from the Committee
              for Education cannot resist the opportunity to mention the last 30
              years. However, I can mention the last 70 years of underfunding
              and discrimination in the part of Ireland that I come from, west
              of the Bann. No one has a monopoly on that. Whether children cycle
              to school or travel by bus or on foot, their safety is of
              paramount importantance to all of us.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with the recommendations, but I wish to
              highlight recommendation 1, which refers to the &quot;3 for
              2&quot; rule, and recommendations 2, 3 and 4, which refer to
              schoolchildren standing on buses. To allow buses with seating for
              53 children to carry up to 100 children is a serious issue that
              must be addressed. That difficult situation should not be allowed
              to continue.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Overcrowding causes stressful situations and
              creates risks. For example, overloaded buses must be unstable,
              especially on bendy, rural roads and in hilly areas of cities.
              That increases the risk to children getting on and off buses.
              Children rush to get on to buses so that they will not have to
              stand or sit on the edge of a seat. They also have to carry very
              heavy school bags, which slow them as they cross roads. Must
              children carry so many books? Could that problem be alleviated?
              Crowded buses also lend themselves to bullying and additional
              problems that would not occur in a managed situation.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.15 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those problems could be addressed without
              massive cost. It would be costly to allow only one child per seat,
              and the provision of seat belts would be even more costly. The
              cost of providing seat belts would be £41 million initially, and
              £22 million a year in running costs. It may also be difficult to
              make children use seat belts. From my experience with my own
              children, I imagine that the seat belts might never be used.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the Chairperson of the Committee for
              Education said, we must consider whether that money might be
              better spent in the classroom. Members of the Committee for
              Education can immediately see the benefits of spending money in
              the classroom, rather than on seat belts, especially given that
              most fatal accidents happen outside, rather than on, school buses.
              We should place more emphasis on stopping those accidents. That is
              a lesson for parents, children and bus drivers, whom I must
              commend for their tremendous work — they have a tough job. They
              are all involved in this situation, and they must be involved in
              the implementation of measures to improve the safety of buses.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The yellow bus system can be commended for many
              reasons. In particular, it slows traffic. There is an argument
              that, because of congestion, it would be impossible to completely
              stop traffic. Nevertheless, there is merit in examining that
              system and in studying the research on the subject, particularly
              in America, where the car is king.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In most areas, young people are unable to cycle
              to school. There are cycle lanes in some towns, and there is a
              move towards providing more. However, until full provision is made
              to enable children to walk or cycle to school, such use of the
              roads will involve a great risk. On most roads, there is just one
              lane, which gives priority to cars only, without room for anyone
              else. Until that is changed, the number of people cycling or
              walking to school will not increase, despite the health benefits
              of such activity.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the benefits of the yellow bus system is
              that it slows down traffic. I am not sure whether we should stop
              traffic completely; however, flashing lights and signs could be
              fixed to the buses that we have already. That would make other
              road users more aware of school buses. As car use is so prominent
              here, I am not sure that people actually have the same awareness
              of, or consideration for, children going to school as they have
              for everyone else using the road, particularly during rush hour.
              That is a problem, and we need to make people aware of it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At this point I appeal to all road users to be
              more aware of children and school buses, because most of the fatal
              accidents I know of — certainly the ones in Fermanagh — have
              been in instances where it is quite difficult for people to
              distinguish a school bus from other buses. Something that would
              bring that difference into focus, whether it be flashing lights or
              something else, would probably save lives, especially in rural
              areas.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the rush hour there is speed,
              intolerance, and lack of consideration on the part of many road
              users. American research has shown that a considerable number of
              people — 1·1 million in Georgia — broke the rules and passed
              school buses regardless of the laws. I feel that it is necessary
              for us to try and implement that legislation, but I am not sure if
              it would be entirely correct for us. However, it is certainly a
              possibility that we should be considering — slowing down traffic
              and making the situation much safer for young people.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The school crossing code educates young people
              on the speed of traffic, but you cannot expect young children to
              know what speed traffic is doing, because they are not drivers.
              Each morning we can see the rush that occurs. At the time when
              children are going to school, everyone else is rushing to work. It
              is a hostile environment for children trying to get to school,
              whether boarding or alighting from buses.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has been proved that the key stages for
              fatal or other injuries are when boarding and alighting. Several
              issues arise at these points, and there are several things that
              the Department for Regional Development, which is outside the
              education budget, could do. Signage could help people focus on the
              dangers of getting off a bus. It could stop children from
              single-mindedly heading for the other side of the road, where they
              happen to live or where there are cars to pick them up.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Much of this subject has actually been covered,
              but we need to further consider the yellow bus system. We need to
              see other research from Europe, where more children cycle to
              school, because it may have much to offer us. Has the research
              mentioned in some of the recommendations been carried out, and if
              not, why not? It looks as if some research has not yet been acted
              on. That is not particularly costly, but it needs to be done. We
              need to know exactly what the recommendations are going to cost.
              The costs are considerable, and are, therefore, part of the
              debate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given our present budgets, it does not seem
              likely that we will be able to implement all of this strategy. We
              are talking about massive funding. Will money come from the
              Department of Education’s budget or that of the Department for
              Regional Development? If we implement this, what will the savings
              be for health? This is the sort of work I want to see done
              immediately.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It does not seem that long ago, but it is quite
              some time since I was getting school buses. I clearly remember
              standing on the steps of a bus, or leaning against the front
              window of a bus, as it travelled down a rural road at up to 60
              mph. Time has moved on. I now leave my son to the bus, and by the
              time it gets to school it is overloaded with children. The bus has
              children standing in it and children sitting &quot;3 for 2&quot;,
              and one wonders what has happened in the intervening period. Why
              have we not addressed this issue, and why have we not dealt with
              it?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Northern Ireland we are fairly stingy when
              it comes to taking our children to and from school. We spend £381
              per child on school transport. Scotland spends £515 and England
              £542 — £721 in London. We are taking our children to school on
              the cheap. We must look at that seriously.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Through the Department for Regional
              Development, Translink bid for £50 million for additional buses
              over a three-year period; £25 million for the first year and £25
              million for the other two years. The bid was rejected by the
              Executive. Therefore, when one hears the discussions about
              encouraging people to use public transport or safer transport,
              while a bid such as that has been totally rejected, one wonders
              where the Executive are coming from.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to deal with several issues in the
              report, and I want to put some things on the record. First, the
              Department of the Environment informed the Committee that, in an
              inspection of 178 buses run by education and library boards in
              February 2000, 37 were found to be in breach of the law and nine
              were prohibited from further use. For the record, 18 vehicles had
              no road service licence, six had no public service vehicle (PSV)
              test certificate, six were without a PSV driving licence, two were
              without excise duty, and there were four other offences, including
              failure to display school signs. That is not acceptable or
              satisfactory. We simply cannot afford to have vehicles on our
              roads that are not meeting the standard.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have heard people pooh-pooh the report,
              saying that it is unrealistic and that the finances involved do
              not stand up. People can reject the Committee’s views; they can
              say that we are just busybody politicians, but perhaps they will
              pay attention to RUC traffic branch, because it had a major role
              in ensuring the safe passage of people on our roads. Ch Insp
              Hiller told the Committee without ambiguity that</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;we must get the buses right and put seat
              belts in place. We must put large amber lights on buses to make
              them clearly visible; hazard warning lights are inadequate because
              they are 18 inches from the ground and quite small … the
              American system is very clear. The concept is excellent. Americans
              seem to take these matters much more seriously than we have in the
              past.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That makes things very clear. There is nothing
              that allows any room for manoeuvre. It must be done. Seat belts
              must be fitted on our buses.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Private coach operators who want to transport
              children must fit seat belts. The children on all those large
              coaches are all seated and wearing seat belts — or at least they
              all have the opportunity to wear them, if the law is properly
              enforced. Translink pointed out what it seemed to think was the
              major difference between its buses and coaches — Translink buses
              are restricted to 58 mph, while coaches are restricted to 62 mph.
              That makes the difference between Translink not having to put seat
              belts in its buses and private coach operators having to put them
              in. Frankly, the argument does not stand up.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ch Insp Hiller went on to say in terms of
              accidents and the potential risk:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;the seat backs and so forth are
              non-absorbent, so they do not absorb the impact. Anyone standing
              will automatically become a projectile, particularly in a frontal
              impact. There will obviously be a pile-up towards the front of the
              bus.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have watched the advertisement on television
              that Minister Nesbitt’s Department funds. You see the young man
              in the back of the car with no seat belt on. You can see his head
              crashing into the face of the young woman. It is very vivid and
              realistic. However, here we have the same Department ignoring the
              situation in relation to young people on buses.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is saying that young men and women in the

              travelling to school in a bus can stand or be seated without
              wearing one. I will quote a final comment from Ch Insp Hiller:</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;In our view it is simply not right, it is

              you that unless you take steps to restrict the potential for a
              serious accident, it is only a matter of time until it

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last December, a young man alighted from a
              school bus. He walked round to the back of the bus, and there was
              no traffic coming up behind it. He walked to the middle of the
              road and found that some traffic was coming the other way. He
              stood waiting for that to clear. In the interim period, several
              other vehicles came up the side of the road that was originally
              clear, one of which was a van. Its wing mirror caught the young
              chap on the side of his head. His mother came and found him lying
              on the road. There were no broken bones; apparently, he had no
              serious injuries. However, whatever part of the vehicle hit that
              young lad on the side of the head, it killed him.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If buses that were leaving children off had
              signage and a system that ensured that vehicles were not allowed
              to pass on either side until the bus moved off, that young man
              would be alive. That is the simple fact of the matter, and if that
              had held up the cars for around 30 seconds or one minute, so be
              it. What was the cost to that life? For that we are not looking
              for millions of pounds to be spent; we are looking for simple
              legislation to be passed. It would perhaps slow down traffic for a
              brief period, but young people are being killed getting on and off
              buses.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the Minister believes that he cannot afford
              to put &quot;3 for 2&quot; seating in or make school buses
              non-standing, surely we can afford to get proper signage and
              lighting on buses. Surely we can address seriously children’s
              safe passage when they are boarding and alighting from buses. If
              we cannot and will not do that, we are ignoring the needs of our
              community and the needs of the children in it. I appeal to the
              Minister to implement this report. I want him to implement it in
              full, but he should certainly begin with the recommendations that
              are easiest to implement. He must start taking the issue
              seriously.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Foster:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the report before the Assembly today.
              Road safety is vital. It was vital when I was Minister in the
              Department. This is undoubtedly a serious issue. I refute the
              accusations thrust towards the Department that when I was
              Minister, we did not take any action. I can assure Members that we
              care deeply about road safety. I feel duty bound to speak on this
              motion — not necessarily to support every one of the many
              recommendations, but to caution that perhaps not enough thought
              has been put into whether some of them are realistic. Let us
              proceed with caution.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can but assume that we all support the depth
              of feeling and care put into the report. None of us here would
              ever want to hear that a child, somebody’s loved one, had been
              killed or severely injured in an accident going to or coming from
              school. One death is one death far too many. Sadly, there was a
              death in my home county of Fermanagh towards the end of last year.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I speak as a parent and a grandparent. I am
              aware of the fears of many people in these days of heavy traffic
              and collisions, which result in many fatalities and cause so much
              heartbreak and heartache to families and friends. However, let me
              make it abundantly clear that no matter what is said by people
              here today — and I have no doubt that they are sincere, —
              nobody has a monopoly on the care or provision necessary to
              protect an innocent child from collisions. Such remarks are not
              made to try to challenge or to doubt the sincerity of those who
              support the report in full. I commend the Committee for its
              deliberations.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee has made 28 recommendations that
              translate into some 40 actions that cross-cut several Departments.
              The four key recommendations are: abolishing the &quot;3 for
              2&quot; provision for public service vehicles; no standing on
              publicly and privately operated road passenger vehicles; the need
              to have seat belts on those vehicles; and proposals for new
              signage and lighting requirements for school buses. Those
              recommendations will require a comprehensive impact assessment,
              which will include an analysis of the cost of implementing the
              changes and the potential road safety benefits that would accrue.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department — and I am not speaking on its
              behalf today — must secure expert advice to assess the detailed
              implementation of the Committee’s recommendations. The
              Chairperson of the Committee, Dr McCrea, must recall the points
              that I made in my letter to him of 12 December 2001 when I was
              Minister of the Environment.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of the Environment, the
              Department of Education, the Department for Regional Development
              and Translink are all involved in making provision to try, at the
              very least, to save a child from injury or death. They will assume
              most of the responsibility for trying to effect such action as
              would help to prevent collisions. However, there are some minor,
              but nevertheless important, actions that stem from the Committee’s
              report that could be introduced to improve safety and which would
              not require major expenditure — and several Members have already
              referred to expenditure. Urgent re-evaluation is required. That
              will not be easy because children can be taken to school in a
              family car, in a relative’s or friend’s vehicle, by Ulsterbus,
              by school bus or by rail to the nearest station. The different
              conveyances used make it more difficult to co-ordinate action to
              ensure safety.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The education and library boards have the power
              to ensure that their vehicles do what is expected within the law.
              A suggestion has been made that all vehicles must stop when
              children are alighting from a bus. However, there is great danger
              in that. If all traffic has to stop when children alight from a
              school bus and are about to cross the road, children could be
              under the false premise that traffic stops every time people
              alight from a bus, and there could be horrible consequences. There
              is a danger that children would be given a false sense of security
              when alighting from an ordinary service bus. That is a vital
              point.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Parents or guardians should have a duty to
              ensure that their children get to school safely. Entitlement to
              school transport is conditional on primary schoolchildren living
              more than two miles from school or public transport. Secondary
              schoolchildren are entitled to school transport if they live at
              least three miles from school or public transport. Many children
              travel on school buses as a concession. Not all schoolchildren can
              obtain transport to school, so many are in an &quot;at risk&quot;
              situation. However, life is not without risks. Any collision by a
              school bus with children on board would be a tragedy. There are
              always risks in life, and families should take greater
              responsibility to ensure that their offspring are protected
              against injury or death.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend the report and its good intent, but I
              think that it should have acknowledged the reality of the
              situation and not have built up expectations.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The education and library boards could improve
              the situation if a personal supervisor were to assist on the buses
              and keep a watching brief on pupils who do not always act their
              age. The bus drivers have enough to do without also having to
              conduct and control pupils. It is the drivers’ responsibility to
              concentrate on the road, and nothing should distract them from
              that. Overcrowding and standing are not acceptable, and the
              roadworthiness of buses is also important.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is easier to be an advocate than the person
              who takes necessary action. I refute the accusations that have
              been thrust at my former Department and myself. Dr McCrea does not
              have a monopoly on care and compassion — we all care.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I acknowledge the report. However, I cannot
              accept it hook, line and sinker, because it encourages aspirations
              that are unlikely to be easily fulfilled. It is somewhat dishonest
              to raise such expectations.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we consider the large number of deaths on
              the roads these days, there is a thought for all of us:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;But O for the touch of a vanished hand,<br>
              And the sound of a voice that is still!&quot;</p>
              </font><b><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Savage:</p>
              </font></b><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Like many Members who have spoken today, I
              serve on the boards of governors of several schools. It is
              impressed upon school governors that they have a duty of care
              towards the children in the schools. The Assembly has a duty of
              care towards all the children of Northern Ireland. With that in
              mind, I wish to see the introduction of measures that will improve
              the safety of children alighting from school buses, particularly
              in country areas.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Traffic on country roads, especially where
              there are no speed limits, can be fast. That is not good for
              children alighting from school buses. A simple measure that could
              greatly enhance children’s safety is the clear marking of school
              buses. That was mentioned earlier in the debate. We are all aware,
              from American films on television, of the purpose-built yellow
              school buses in the United States. It may seem to be a small
              thing, but brightly coloured school buses could make an important
              contribution to saving lives, particularly when the buses have to
              travel in country areas in the early morning or late in the
              evening when visibility is reduced.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should always be aware that children might
              be on a road. Whenever one sees a bus, one can be sure that
              someone is going to get on or off it. I congratulate the Committee
              for the Environment on bringing forward its proposals today.
              However, we must ensure that drivers are made to exercise greater
              care — especially on small country roads, where people may not
              be as careful as the rest of us. There will always be someone who
              will flout the law. As time goes on, more and more children will
              use school transport. We can go a long way today towards solving
              the problems that the report highlights.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A clear message that has come out of the debate
              today is that cost is a major factor. However, what cost do you
              put on the life of a young child? Regardless of family, colour or
              religion, a child’s life cannot be replaced. I am glad that the
              Minister of Education and the Minister of the Environment are both
              present today. I say to them that we frequently hear about
              discrimination, but in my constituency there are many places where
              groups of children get on and off school buses. It is wrong that
              some have to pay while others do not. All children should have
              free transport to school. That would save time when boarding or
              alighting from the buses, and it would save the energy of the bus
              drivers. I hope that I live to see the day when all children will
              have free transport. I support the motion.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.45 pm</p>
              </i><b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of the Environment (Mr Nesbitt):</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have listened with great interest — and I
              say that in all sincerity — to the debate. I support
              wholeheartedly the sentiments that Members have expressed in word
              and spirit. Road safety is a top priority for the Department of
              the Environment. Quite often, road deaths and injuries are
              avoidable and, as often as not, they are the result of human error
              such as carelessness, inattention, excessive speed, alcohol
              consumption or failure to wear seat belts.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The death or injury of a child is especially
              tragic. Parents and grandparents know that a child represents a
              bundle of opportunity. Therefore, the Department of the
              Environment has an onerous responsibility to ensure that it does
              everything possible to promote road safety. I speak for all
              Ministers, especially those who are directly responsible for road
              safety — Mr McGuinness and Peter Robinson and I — when I say
              that we will continue to do all that we can to improve this aspect
              of road safety.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will make some general comments on the
              Committee for the Environment’s report. I listened carefully to
              Dr McCrea’s comments. He said that he gave an honest, open
              account of the situation. I share many of the sentiments expressed
              in his report. He concluded by saying that</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;we will seldom ever have a more serious
              issue before us&quot;.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I concur with that. There is seldom a more
              serious issue than that of the life of a child, the future of
              Northern Ireland, so I thank the Chairperson and the Committee for
              their extensive work. I assure the Assembly that my ministerial
              Colleagues and I are considering seriously the Committee report,
              as did my predecessor, Mr&nbsp;Foster. I also support what he
              said.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A comprehensive evaluation is needed and will
              be carried out on the key recommendations. I emphasise the words
              &quot;comprehensive evaluation&quot; and &quot;key
              recommendations&quot; because the evaluation will be complex and
              lengthy. Some 28 recommendations and 44 actions were proposed.
              They fall within the competence of the Department of the
              Environment, the Department of Education and the Department for
              Regional Development. Each of those Departments will develop the
              specific recommendations for which they are responsible.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The length of time that the Department of the
              Environment took to respond was commented upon. The Department of
              Education and the Department for Regional Development each made an
              initial response in November. The Department of the Environment,
              as the overall umbrella Department, produced — and it took until
              February — a comprehensive response compiling the three
              Departments’ recommendations and detailing how each is to be
              progressed. Therefore, the wait from November to February was
              justified.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have discussed key recommendations and what
              needs to be done. One aspect that filtered through the debate was
              the financial implication. That is relevant. Nothing crystallises
              the mind more than having to live within one’s budget. That
              applies also to school safety provision.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall look at the main recommendations
              briefly. I said that there were four key recommendations. The
              words of the report are:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;on the clear need to increase safety and
              quality standards of the transport used for home to school
              transport.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The four recommendations were simple to state:
              the abolition of the &quot;3 for 2&quot; provision; the phased
              introduction of no standing for schoolchildren on buses; the
              phased introduction of lap and diagonal seat belts for all
              schoolchildren; and improved signage and flashing lights. Dr
              McCrea rightly said that those recommendations have far-reaching
              implications, and I accept that. He also made a point about the
              financial implications. A third point that he made was that,
              although the recommendations are far-reaching, that does not mean
              that nothing can be done in the interim. Something is being done.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The financial implications are important. I was
              struck by Mr Kennedy’s comment that, whenever action is decided,
              funds should not be taken from the classroom. We are mindful that
              he is asking that the Committee for the Environment and I support
              the Minister of Education if or when he bids for funds. I note
              that in passing.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall touch on the aspect of expenditure and
              give an indication of the cost to implement the four
              recommendations. The abolition of the &quot;3 for 2&quot; seating
              provision will have an estimated capital cost of £3 million and
              an annual running cost of £2 million. The abolition of standing
              on school buses will incur a capital cost of £38 million and
              annual running costs of £21 million. Seat belts will have a
              capital cost of £140 million and an estimated annual running cost
              of £40 million. The cost of new hazard lights is currently not
              known in detail. However, the costs will amount to £181 million
              for capital expenditure and £63 million for the annual running
              costs for the simple implementation of the four key principles,
              which is not inconsequential.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have looked generally at the detailed
              recommendations and at the costs involved. I said earlier that a
              comprehensive impact assessment and a cost-benefit analysis of the
              more detailed recommendations is required. That analysis will
              include a more accurate estimate of the cost of implementing the
              changes. In looking at the costs, we must also assess the benefits
              — namely the potential road safety benefits of putting that
              multimillion spend into place. That will require appropriate,
              expert and professional advice. A new post has already been
              created in the Department to undertake that work and to be
              responsible for co-ordinating external advice.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To implement the four main recommendations will
              require a robust case to be made to the Executive. Significant
              resources are required for their implementation. Rapid decisions
              on the four main recommendations will not happen; we must
              undertake the assessment. As I have said, the analysis will be
              complex and comprehensive. I wish to make it clear that I
              empathise with what the Committee says about what needs to be
              done. However, the report did not offer the prima facie case, that
              road safety benefits were likely to be commensurate with full
              implementation. Figures were mentioned, which I shall come to, but
              the prima facie case was not there. Perhaps a prima facie case
              could not be offered, given what the Committee was doing — and I
              do not say that as a criticism of the Committee. Therefore, the
              Executive’s approach to the analysis of these four key elements
              must be detailed, sensible and pragmatic.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The child road casualties are the important
              element. It has been shown that children are significantly more at
              risk as pedestrians or as car passengers than they are as bus
              passengers. In the last four years 131 children were killed or
              seriously injured while travelling to or from school, but none of
              those killed and only six of those injured were occupants of
              buses, coaches or minibuses. That is a small proportion. Mr
              Gallagher said that most fatal accidents occur when alighting from
              or boarding buses, and Mr McHugh perceived the problem as being
              outside school buses, not actually on the buses. The statistics
              indicate that the problem arises in the vicinity of buses, but I
              do not want to reduce a sensitive issue to mere statistics.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee’s report on page 1, under the
              heading &quot;Collision Statistics 1995-1999: Children Under 16
              Years Travelling To and From School&quot; shows that the
              statistics do not distinguish between slight and serious injuries
              and that children travelling to and from school are grouped under
              different modes of transport — bus and car/van. Those statistics
              do not, however, disaggregate. When the figures are disaggregated
              it is found that travel on buses is safer than it is in a car or
              as a pedestrian.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore, children’s behaviour coming from
              or going to school, in and around school bus stops and alighting
              from or boarding a bus is widely accepted as requiring attention.
              Road safety education is a key area. As Mr McCrea said, the fact
              that the issues are complex does not mean that nothing can be
              done. The Department of the Environment has taken that aspect
              seriously. Under Mr Foster’s guidance, the number of road safety
              officers was increased from 11 to 21 — in other words, it almost
              doubled. That enables us to intensify those officers’ work in
              schools and to allow the introduction of new education
              initiatives. For example, we will ensure that every school is
              visited at least twice a year, amounting to 4,000 visits by
              departmental education officers to schools. That is a significant
              contribution to education and road safety. We are mindful that the
              danger lies in alighting from and boarding buses. Through the
              remit of the education officers, the Department of the Environment
              also gives valuable support by providing teaching material worth
              £650,000 on road safety in schools.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.00 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those are among the Department’s attempts to
              educate young people about road safety. However, there will be
              other initiatives. Mr Gallagher said that schools should be made
              particularly aware of safety. My Colleague, Ken Robinson, said
              that people were often glib about road safety. We must ensure that
              people are conscious of road safety. My Department will introduce
              practical child pedestrian training in October 2002, in support of
              classroom training. Later this year we will introduce a new
              initiative called the &quot;children’s traffic club&quot;, as
              part of which the parents of every three-year-old will receive six
              free books on road safety at three-monthly intervals. The thrust
              towards education is part of the Department’s structured
              approach to encourage parents to teach pre-schoolchildren about
              road safety.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department will be examining other
              initiatives on education and publicity. I am conscious of the
              problems, and I intend to ensure that children and other
              vulnerable road users become more alert to the dangers of the
              roads — that permeates everything that must be done. It applies
              not only to children but to drivers and motorcyclists. People must
              recognise buses as critical danger zones for children.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ken Robinson, Mr Kennedy and Ms Morrice
              referred to the school bus system in the United States. Although
              the Executive have overall responsibility for the matter,
              recommendations relating to the American model are matters for the
              Department of Education and the Department for Regional
              Development. My Department’s responsibility is limited to
              ensuring that any vehicles used as part of pilot or permanent
              schemes meet the relevant technical standards.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The two principal features of the American
              system are purpose-built buses — we have seen them in the movies
              or during visits to America — and road traffic rules that
              require motorists travelling in each direction to stop when the
              buses are stationary. Both were mentioned today. The matter
              requires careful examination, as I will demonstrate. Such road
              traffic rules would be the responsibility of the Department for
              Regional Development, and if it wished to introduce such rules, my
              Department would be fully behind it in assisting with the
              provision of any necessary public information. My Department has
              spent much time and effort on road safety education.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It might be beneficial to prohibit the
              overtaking of buses that have stopped to allow children to alight.
              However, we do not have dedicated school buses, such as those in
              America. If we adopted such a system, children might presume that
              it is safe to cross the road when any bus stops and that traffic
              will have stopped. They might develop the habit of running across
              the road, without worrying about traffic, after alighting from a
              bus. That is a serious point. I am not saying that the
              recommendation is wrong; but something of that nature requires
              serious consideration before it is introduced.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A pilot scheme is currently underway in
              Calderdale, Yorkshire, managed by the Department for Transport,
              Local Government and the Regions. It began in February 2002 using
              adapted American buses. It does not include traffic control
              measures for such things as overtaking, or speed restrictions.
              However, the Department of the Environment is mindful of what is
              happening there and will monitor the scheme closely.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Paisley raised the issue that 101 children
              being crammed on board a 53-seater bus was a calamity waiting to
              happen. I agree that that is indefensible. However, the Assembly
              must ensure that when statistics are used, they are not
              misleading. The figure of 101 is simply calculated from the
              theoretical &quot;3 for 2&quot; maximum number on a bus, allowing
              for standing passengers. However, the figure of 101 does not
              operate in practice. The Committee for the Environment reported
              that Translink carries a maximum of 75 passengers on each bus and
              makes limited use of the &quot;3 for 2&quot; provision.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report also stated that the education and
              library boards have an operating maximum of 79 passengers per bus,
              and they do not permit standing. Translink and the education and
              library boards are at liberty to reduce standing and the &quot;3
              for 2&quot; provision. That does not require legal change.
              However, it would have significant financial implications. I
              empathise with Dr Paisley’s sentiments about cramming on school
              buses. The Assembly must, however, be mindful of the statistics.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr B Hutchinson:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of the Environment has released
              a hard-hitting advert about the dangers of not wearing a seat
              belt. The emphasis is put on a young lad who does not strap
              himself in and causes his girlfriend permanent brain damage.
              Considering what Dr Paisley and his Colleagues have said, I
              assumed that the issue being discussed is that when people are
              standing on buses they become potential projectiles.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Nesbitt:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not deny that people standing on buses can
              become projectiles. The House does not want to reduce such a
              sensitive issue to statistics. However, in that context, there are
              more road killings and injuries involving cars than involving
              buses or pedestrians. That advertisement is directed particularly
              at people who do not wear seat belts in the back seats. At speed,
              the back seat passenger can project forward. I accept the Member’s
              point. However, I must also put it into context.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice suggested the &quot;walking
              bus&quot;. She praised its introduction. I thank her for reminding
              me about it. A walking bus pilot scheme has taken place at
              Moneyreagh Primary School. For people who are not fully conversant
              with the idea, a walking bus is not a vehicle, but an organised
              party of children walking to and from school under parental
              supervision. Those taking part are appropriately dressed in
              fluorescent or reflective garments. The Department is assisting
              two schools in Limavady and Ballymoney to organise similar walking
              buses in September 2002, and aims to further promote the practice
              in Northern Ireland. I thank Ms Morrice for raising the issue and
              enabling me to draw it to the Assembly’s attention.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I assure the Assembly that we are, have been,
              and will continue giving the Committee’s report serious
              consideration. I say that not on behalf of my Department but as a
              representative of the Executive. It is for other Ministers to
              bring forward their own thoughts on the report, but the Executive
              are seriously considering it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Detailed evaluations of the key recommendations
              will be conducted as quickly and as practically as possible. A new
              official is in post to conduct the research and analysis. We are
              not standing still. To paraphrase Mr McCrea’s initial comments,
              the fact that some of the big things cannot be done does not mean
              that nothing can be done. I have mentioned areas where we have
              been doing things and will continue to do things.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I repeat the commitment that I made at the
              outset: none of us wants to see any road deaths. Most of them are
              avoidable, but the road death or injury of a child is particularly
              sensitive. Therefore, I have no doubt that all Members who took
              part in the debate are not, and should not be, trying to score
              political points. Rather, we should try to do what is right for
              the future of Northern Ireland, because the future lies with the
              children.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr William McCrea:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Members who participated in the
              debate for their largely positive and constructive contributions.
              The seriousness of the issue is clear to everyone in the Chamber.
              For a long time, safety on school buses has been a major concern
              to parents and school principals, which is why the Committee
              sought to address the matter in greater detail. Immediate action
              is required on the detailed recommendations brought forward by the
              Committee.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to deal with some of the contributions,
              but, because I have been allotted only 10 minutes, I cannot reply
              to many comments. Mr Nesbitt said that we should not seek to score
              political points. I do not know where the Minister got that from
              or why he felt it relevant. Let me make it abundantly clear that
              it was the unanimous opinion of the entire Committee.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was saddened that the former Minister of the
              Environment, Mr Foster, chose to attack me personally by saying
              that I do not have a monopoly on compassion or caring. I have
              never sought to bring forward my personal opinion in Committee,
              although I fully endorse and wholeheartedly agree with the report.
              I have sought to represent honestly and fairly the unanimous
              opinion of the Committee. The Committee members who spoke today
              made it abundantly clear that the report represents the unanimous
              opinion of the Committee.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not know why there was a personal attack
              or why seeking to score political points was mentioned. This issue
              has nothing to do with scoring political points. We are talking
              about one of the most serious matters affecting the lives of
              families and communities — the lives and safety of our children.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.15 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Irrespective of the school he or she is going
              to or coming from, every child is of equal importance, and we
              value the lives of all our children. I trust that that has nothing
              to do with scoring political points, but that it has everything to
              do with the safety of our children’s transport. For that I will
              never apologise. It constitutes the main thrust of the report, and
              I stand wholeheartedly by that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report does not state that we have a
              monopoly on care or that we should beat our chests and say that we
              have a monopoly on wisdom. No one has a monopoly on wisdom or
              anything else. Let us be honest; surely we all learn something
              through the Assembly, and surely this debate has made us all think
              carefully. The contribution of the Member for East Antrim, Mr Ken
              Robinson, was a thoughtful and helpful contribution. He put his
              finger on many points that concerned Committee members and which
              should concern the Assembly. He referred to fundamental principles
              and impressed the importance of several recommendations on the
              Assembly. We should recognise those points and act on them.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let me therefore repeat: any notion that this
              matter concerns party political issues must be completely removed.
              It is a political issue, and this is a political forum. It affects
              all our children, irrespective of the party people support, and I
              will defend the right of every parent to demand that the Chamber
              represent their will and their wish for their children to travel
              to school in safety. That is the burden and the emphasis of the
              report.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I take seriously the comments of the
              Chairperson of the Committee for Education, and I support Mr
              Kennedy’s call for the education and library boards to progress
              pilot schemes to improve safety in boarding and alighting from
              school buses. Mr Kennedy also mentioned action being taken by
              education and library boards, but unfortunately my Committee has
              no information on that matter. That highlights the need for
              co-ordinated action by officials from the Departments involved,
              with the Department of the Environment taking the lead.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member for North Down, Jane Morrice,
              mentioned that the Committee was too lenient about phased
              proposals to prevent standing on buses and to provide seat belts.
              I understand her point, but it contradicts the opinion of some
              people who thought that the Committee was pie in the sky and
              unrealistic. The Committee was criticised for being too soft. It
              shows, however, that the Committee was careful to frame its
              recommendations in order to ensure implementation and to address
              priorities. It endeavoured to do that with consideration, not
              thoughtlessly or recklessly. I know that many people would have
              liked matters to be rushed ahead.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I take seriously the point made by my hon
              Friend Dr Paisley in respect of 101 children in a 53-seater bus.
              In their evidence to the Committee the police said that it is
              legal to carry 101 children or less in such a bus. In 2002 it
              should not acceptable that such a situation is considered legal.
              The Minister said that that does not happen, and he pointed out
              that the report stated that the number of children on a Translink
              bus was 75, and the number on an Ulsterbus was 79. The Minister
              should know that that is the evidence that was given to the
              Committee; it is not an assumption that the Committee made.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the Member for East Londonderry, Mr A
              Doherty, reminded the Assembly that two principals told the
              Committee in oral evidence that up to 90 children per bus were
              travelling to their schools. Where did the figures of 75 and 79 go
              to? The Committee dealt with the hard evidence that it was given.
              Those principals were seriously concerned. What message is the
              Minister giving? Ninety children are being crammed into one bus,
              and yet we put advertisements on television that lecture the
              importance of having seat belts in the back of cars.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The figures mentioned are 75, 79 and 90 — up
              to 101. The Assembly is giving those young people a dual message;
              it would be fair of them to assume that it is not really serious.
              The Police Service provided the Committee with the following
              statement about the wearing of seat belts:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Our paramount priority is road safety,
              although we understand that there are other issues such as the
              environment and congestion. We want to see children on school
              buses afforded the same opportunity for protection as afforded to
              those travelling in cars&quot;.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore, the Committee could not close its
              mind to that issue. It is a calamity waiting to happen.</p>

              That has been done through all the relevant channels, and Question

              might be in the context of the victims strategy that was launched
              last week. We all need to do more and work harder. It is not just
              the devolved Departments whose locus is being looked at in the

              other occasions, that party is at pains to deny. Nevertheless, it
              was a party political event. My views as the leader of the SDLP
              and the SDLP’s views have been registered elsewhere on that. As
              with the earlier question, I do not believe that Question Time for

              under the auspices of the North/South Ministerial Council, with
              the final report expected at the next plenary meeting.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We recognise the advantages that would accrue

              been covered in the report that the First Minister and I tabled on
              the meeting in institutional format.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In making that report, we also tabled the

              parliamentary forum is a matter for the Assembly and the
              Oireachtas to consider. I would like to see that consideration

              which it has been asked. It is true that the influence of the euro
              and the inroads made in its circulation are significant,
              particularly in border areas such as that represented by the
              Member. Many businesses operate a dual currency system. However,
              that is not a matter of Executive policy. This question is not
              alone in taking us slightly beyond the brief of the Office of the
              First Minister and the Deputy First Minister when representing
              Assembly views.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the Minister for Europe, Mr Hain, was
              here recently; the Minister of Finance and Personnel, Dr Farren,
              and I had separate meetings with him. He made a point of going to
              Newry to experience the impact of the euro in a border area.
              Undoubtedly, he came away with a better idea of its actual impact
              in areas of the North than he would have had if he had not so
              visited.</p>

              whether it is the tensions that have always existed coming more
              clearly into focus now that there is no longer a terrorist
              campaign. The terrorist campaign had the effect of suppressing or

              with regard to Drumcree. If we are successful in defusing the
              problems in north Belfast, we will have to look seriously at what
              lessons may be learned from the action we are taking there, and to
              what extent those lessons may be applicable elsewhere. As I said a
              moment ago, if we are looking at how to improve community
              relations, we must focus on areas like north Belfast. We have to
              consider carefully whether there is something we can do and, if
              so, how to do it. Nothing would give me or, I am sure, the Deputy

              the commissioner. We were also concerned about ensuring that the
              grounds on which the powers are exercisable are clearly stated.
              Juvenile justice is a reserved matter, and we can give the
              commissioner authoritative power to deal with that area only with
              the approval of the Secretary of State. His approval is required
              for those provisions to enable us to legislate in the reserved

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last summer, the Executive endorsed targets for
              the electronic delivery of 25% of key Government services by 2002,
              with a target of 100% by 2005. That demonstrates the importance

              commitment made to modernise Government in the Programme for
              Government. The Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First
              Minister has the lead role in developing e-government. In November
              2001, we published a corporate strategic framework that set out
              how Departments should develop their e-government plans. In line
              with that framework, all Departments, including OFMDFM, have
              produced an e-business strategy that sets out how we shall achieve
              the targets for electronic service delivery. The central IT unit
              in OFMDFM will commission an overarching e-business strategy that
              will draw together the common threads in the departmental
              strategies. It will set out the Executive’s priorities in
              electronic service delivery and the potential for joined-up
              service delivery.</p>

              the needs of customers down the line? I am worried that, although
              we have the strategy — and I have no doubt that those who are at
              the head of political matters are doing the right thing — there
              is resistance down the line to adopt e-government practice through

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposed regional transportation strategy,
              which is out for public consultation, envisages the construction
              of a number of town and village bypasses in the next 10 years. The
              strategy has to be considered later this year and the additional
              funding has to be secured, but if this type of programme can be
              realised it will make a significant contribution to enhancing the
              environment by reducing congestion.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Meanwhile, the Roads Service has already
              commenced work on the Limavady, Strabane and Newtownstewart
              bypasses, while the proposed bypasses of Comber and Toomebridge
              are due to start later this year. The Omagh throughpass is
              currently being processed through the statutory procedures. All
              these schemes will directly assist in addressing the problem of
              tailbacks in those areas.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Furthermore, the Roads Service will continue to
              invest in traffic management measures to improve the efficiency
              and safety of existing road space in towns and villages. However,
              we all have to acknowledge that building and improving roads is
              not the complete answer to traffic congestion. We have to address
              the spiralling demand to provide for the private car. In this
              context, the aim of the regional transportation strategy is to
              enable a move away from a transport system dominated by car use to
              a more balanced and integrated system in which walking, cycling
              and public transport will be attractive options on many trips. The
              focus will be on moving people and goods rather than moving
              vehicles; it will be on making people more aware of the full cost
              and impact of their transport choices and on reducing the need to
              travel.</p>

              public-private partnership. Can the Minister inform the House of
              the progress of this venture, and will he consider a similar
              scheme for Cookstown? Does he realise that up to £10 million may
              be lost annually to business in my constituency, Mid Ulster, due
              to traffic hold-ups, not to mention business being subdued due to

              the establishment of the Glengalliagh Road on the Skeoge lands.
              Lord Dubs gave an assurance some time ago that the money was in

              understanding in its recent response that, if money was used to
              strengthen the Foyle Bridge, the funding might not be there for

              To say that they were significantly over our estimates would be to
              understate our surprise when we opened those tenders. Rather than
              impact on schemes such as Skeoge, we have concluded that we would
              put off strengthening the Foyle Bridge. Users of the bridge will
              be content to know that no immediate difficulties will be
              encountered by the delay in implementing that scheme. The

              proposals. We hope to proceed with the schemes outlined for that
              area. We must go through the statutory processes, which do delay
              those schemes, but the Department is as keen as Members will be to

              houses, accessing from the Listooder Road, Saintfield, which is
              near to the Academy Primary School. That application also includes
              a proposal for another smaller development of 17 houses to be
              accessed from The Grange, off the Ballynahinch Road. As a
              statutory consultee in the planning process, my Department’s
              Roads Service has been consulted by the Department of the
              Environment’s Planning Service regarding that application. Roads

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the opportunity to answer questions
              on a new area of activity for the Department for Regional
              Development. It is good to see that some people are interested in
              matters other than the old faithful issues of roads, water, ports
              and so forth. As someone with considerable interest in computer
              matters — in some circles I might be considered to be something
              of an anorak — I can see immense possibilities for e-government.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Apart from the study carried out by
              PricewaterhouseCoopers, which had a wide range of consultation,
              the Department for Regional Development has a full e-consultation
              process on its web site. The Department can be considered to be
              enabled 100% in that area. The only problem is that many of my
              Department’s functions are not suitable for electronic delivery.
              However, there is clearly e-information and e-consultation. In
              those areas in which transactions can take place, they can be done
              in a wider sphere.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The important issue for the Department for
              Regional Development is in relation to the qualitative response
              that it gives to the strategy. It would be easy for the Department
              to have 100% of its services that are capable of electronic
              delivery to be so available by 2005. I can argue that 90% of those
              services are electronically delivered at present, which goes
              beyond the 25% to be delivered by the end of the year. However,
              those services can be delivered in several different ways.
              According to the strategy it would be sufficient for them to be
              delivered by telephone. In my view, unless the response is via
              telephone, e-mail and the Internet, it is not a proper response. I
              want to see quality in the way that the Department delivers on the
              requirements and targets that have been set, not simply the
              meeting of targets.</p>

              There is a document that I will make available in the Library if
              Members have not already seen it. They can see either the
              executive summary or the larger version if they wish. In fact, if
              they go to the Department for Regional Development’s web site
              they will probably be able to download the document. I will
              examine the specific issue of comparative costs. However, the
              Department is not offering an &quot;instead of&quot; option. It is
              putting forward an additional option. If the Member is seeking
              figures in relation to what that additional mechanism is costing,
              I can tell him that in 1999-2000 the capital costs were £3·2
              million, but the departmental running costs were around £4·3
              million. In 2000-01 the capital costs were £3·1 million, and the
              departmental running costs were £4·6 million. In 2001-02 the
              capital costs were £3·8 million, and the departmental running
              costs were £5 million.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I point out, however, that those are costs by
              which the Department is gaining the advantage of being able to
              function at a higher level. Therefore, the advantage is not simply
              to the consumer but also to the Department.</p>

              He specifically mentioned the Antrim to Knockmore line. The figure
              that I gave him earlier represents the costs for the mere
              publication of the documentation. For the Antrim to Knockmore
              line, the figure contained within the numbers that I provided
              earlier is £3,600. However, the real cost, when all the other
              paraphernalia, including labour costs, are added in is £50,000.
              If that figure is multiplied for the regional transportation
              strategy, the regional development strategy et cetera, the immense
              cost can be seen. I would far rather that the money be spent on
              hip replacements or more books in schools — <i>[Interruption].</p>

              regional development strategy and the regional transportation
              strategy, are of great assistance, where people who had an

              some are carried out because they are the best way to inform
              people of the subject matter. A schedule of consultation cannot be
              worked out. As soon as a new issue is addressed, it goes out for
              consultation. As I have said, consultation has an important role
              to play. I value my consultation with the Committee for Regional
              Development. I value consultations on specific schemes, where we
              ask for and receive views from the public. I am concerned about
              having to consult people who I know are not remotely interested in
              the subject matter. However, the equality impact assessment
              requirements under section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998

              Harland &amp; Wolff’s lease of lands in the harbour estate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was first notified of the company’s desire
              to secure the removal of the restricted user clause from its lease
              of some of the lands it currently occupies in the harbour estate
              when Sir David Fell, chairman of Harland &amp; Wolff Group, met
              Sir Reg Empey and myself on 18 February 2002 to brief us on the
              company’s new business plan. The company has identified an area
              of some 80 acres as being no longer required for its shipbuilding
              activities. Its new business plan envisages a more compact yard
              and diversification of engineering activity, as well as the
              regeneration of those lands no longer required for shipbuilding.
              Consequently, the proposal has major implications for the company’s
              future and for land use generally in the harbour estate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey’s interest mainly centres on
              the feasibility of the company’s new business plan. It was
              recognised at the outset that a view on the business plan would
              inform our decision-making process on the land. While our
              respective Departments have been working within the very tight
              timescale notified by the company, the seriousness of the company’s
              situation and the complexities of the issues demanded that the

              ship repair in Belfast. However, I approach the matter
              strategically, mindful of the considerable economic development
              and the potential for job creation of the land in the harbour
              estate which Harland &amp; Wolff has indicated is surplus to its
              shipbuilding requirements.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addressing the issue of the land I have made
              it clear that any arrangement reached between the Belfast Harbour
              Commissioners, as landlord, and Harland &amp; Wolff, as tenant,
              must be justifiable and acceptable in its own right, regardless of

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also concerned to ensure that the public

              Ireland. The conditions attached to any agreement between Belfast
              Harbour Commissioners and Titanic Properties Ltd will be construed
              so as to meet those primary objectives and will be a matter for
              negotiation.</p>

              That decision will, however, arise from negotiations with Harland

              Department’s agencies also provide the public with information
              in several electronically available forms. During 2001,

              to deliver its key services electronically. For example,<b> the

              telephone booking service for its customers from August 2002.
              Payment will be made with either a </b>debit or a credit card,

              and driver test results will be sent directly to Driver and
              Vehicle Licensing Northern Ireland (DVLNI). Together with plans
              for expanded links with the insurance industry, that will enable
              telephone re-licensing of vehicles to be made available to

              It was the least that I expected from him, because I know that he
              had in interest in, and an awareness of, e-government during his
              time as a junior Minister. The corporate strategic framework for
              the electronic delivery of services specifies that Departments
              will consult with their customers to ensure that their needs are
              addressed. What processes has the Department of the Environment,

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are key services that we need to identify
              for e-government. Twenty-five per cent of those key services must
              be in place by 2002. However, the guidance states that the key
              services should be introduced: where there are many transactions,
              such as the renewal of road fund licences; where the transactions
              are highly valued by citizens, such as bookings for an MOT; and
              where citizens are obliged to transact with the public sector,
              such as the notification of a change of address. Each Department
              must identify key services and determine how e-government will be
              implemented. In identifying the key elements, I have tried to
              clarify where they apply to the Department of the Environment.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under article 27 of the Planning (Northern
              Ireland) Order 1991, the Department has the power to attach
              conditions, including landscaping conditions, to planning
              permission. Those conditions are imposed when they are considered
              necessary, relevant, precise, enforceable and reasonable. In the
              past year, the Department approved 20,092 planning applications,
              all of which contained relevant planning conditions. Given the
              volume of applications, it is impractical to monitor all planning
              approval conditions comprehensively to ensure their compliance.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, planning policy statement 9, ‘The
              Enforcement of Planning Control’, sets out the Department’s
              general policy approach to its discretionary enforcement powers.
              If the Department considers it expedient to take enforcement
              action, that action will be commensurate with the breach of
              planning control to which it relates. When members of the public
              notify the Department of an unauthorised development, it will be
              investigated. In the first instance, the Department will seek to
              achieve a satisfactory resolution through negotiation. If that is
              not possible, the Department has the statutory power to institute
              formal enforcement action to resolve the situation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I propose to bring before the Assembly soon a
              Bill that will considerably strengthen the Department’s
              enforcement powers. The Department is also recruiting additional
              staff to bolster the Planning Service’s development control and
              enforcement functions.</p>

              answer. However, the system seems to be a long-drawn-out and
              expensive way of ensuring that stipulations are adhered to. Will
              the Minister consider the idea that, when planning approval that
              includes landscaping is granted, the developer should have to
              lodge a sum of money to cover the cost of that landscaping? I do
              not wish to be personal, but in Portstewart, where I live, umpteen
              developments have been approved with landscaping. Last week I
              checked about 10 of those developments, and not even a blade of
              grass had been planted. I am sure that the Minister agrees that
              insufficient staff are available to check that stipulations are
              adhered to. Will he consider introducing the advance lodgement of
              money by developers to cover landscaping costs?</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Enforcement is a fundamental function of the
              Department, on which I place a great deal of importance. Its aim
              is to bring unauthorised activity under the Department’s
              control, to remedy the undesirable effects that Ms Armitage
              mentioned and to take legal action. However, as the Member rightly
              said, we do not have sufficient resources. The Department has
              addressed the backlog in planning applications, and when it
              recruits additional staff it will ensure that enforcement takes
              place, where appropriate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By and large, the Department trusts the
              integrity of planning applicants, and often, when it alerts
              someone that he is in breach of a condition, the matter is
              rectified. However, I remind Members that the Department can, and
              will, take legal action if that does not happen. The Department
              must always be careful that legal action is timely; it is costly,
              so it must be effective.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall take note of Ms Armitage’s
              interesting suggestion that money be lodged in advance to ensure
              that conditions are adhered to, and I shall see what happens.</p>

              enforcement officers, which has led to problems. My Colleague from
              East Antrim Roger Hutchinson gave the example of travelling people
              who built walls or erected gates but moved on before the Planning
              Service could enforce the planning regulations, with the result
              that nothing could be done. On other occasions, enforcement
              officers were unable to take action against illegal applicants
              because of manpower shortages. What does the Department intend to

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have had no discussions with the developer or
              his agents about that development. The proposals, which were
              submitted on the basis of two outline planning applications,
              include a food superstore, retail warehousing, business parks and
              a new link road between the Comber Road and the Portaferry Road.
              However, since receipt of the planning applications, officials
              from my Department have been in regular contact with the developer
              and his agents about the various elements relating to them. That
              included discussions about retail impact, traffic implications and
              the protection of the historic landscape of the area, including
              scheduled monuments. The Department has also been involved in
              detailed discussions with the developer and with the Department
              for Regional Development’s Roads Service with regard to
              necessary road improvements to deal with traffic generated by the
              development. Ards Borough Council supported the proposals,
              indicating that they would be of benefit to Newtownards. The
              Member is aware that on 15 March 2002 I announced a notice of
              opinion to grant planning permission for the proposed development.</p>

              plans are in place for landowners who have land designated as
              nitrate vulnerable zones.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Arrangements for dealing with nitrate pollution
              are based on the requirements of EC Directive 91/676/EEC, which
              aims to reduce nitrate levels in areas where the water is polluted
              and to prevent new pollution. The Directive was transposed into
              Northern Ireland legislation by Regulations made in 1996 and 1999.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1999, three ground waters were identified
              where nitrate levels exceeded the maximum permitted level under
              the Directive. These three areas were identified and designated as
              nitrate vulnerable zones (NVZs) in March 1999. One is at
              Cloughmills, County Antrim; the other two are near Comber, County
              Down. There are approximately 100 farms within the three zones.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Action programmes were established in June
              1999, setting out measures which must be taken by people farming
              in these zones. Those measures include closed periods for the use
              of nitrogen fertiliser and organic manures and permitted
              application rates for nitrogen based on crop requirements. There
              are also controls on spreading fertiliser and manure, taking
              account of ground conditions and proximity to waterways.
              Requirements are also in place for the provision of slurry storage
              and the keeping of farm records, covering cropping, livestock
              numbers and the use of nitrogen fertilisers and organic manures.
              These measures are applied in ways appropriate to the particular
              agricultural activities carried out on each of the relevant farms.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The European Commission has recently indicated
              that the Directive applies to surface waters that are eutrophic,
              or likely to become eutrophic, through nutrient enrichment. The
              European Commission is currently taking infraction proceedings
              against France for failure to implement the Directive on those
              grounds. Accordingly, the Environment and Heritage Service of my
              Department is reviewing its water quality monitoring data. If,
              following this review, any other areas are identified as candidate
              NVZs, my officials will consult farmers and other interested
              parties before proposing any further designations.</p>

              nitrate vulnerable zones are subject to a range of measures,
              depending on the particular circumstances of individual farms.
              While I am aware of farmers’ concerns about these implications,
              I want to make it clear that I have met representatives of the
              farming industry. I have asked my officials to clarify the
              scientific explanation and measurement for both unions in the
              farming industry. If we are all aware of the problems, that will
              help us all to address the solutions. Direct assistance in the
              form of grants which might comply with the controls, for example,
              falls to the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development.</p>

              quality is a particularly important issue. I wonder about the
              relevance of the measures that have been drawn from Europe. They
              are generally suitable there. However, measures relating to
              nitrates in particular are not appropriate for this part of Europe
              where farmers can put slurry on their land. I hope that the
              Minister will get as much information on those points as possible,
              especially from the farming organisations.</p>

              Slurry and artificial fertiliser are the most significant sources
              of excess nutrients. I accept that that is relevant to the farming
              industry. In the same breath, I must say that treated sewage
              effluents, storm sewage discharges, septic tanks and surface
              drains in urban areas are also major sources of nutrients. This
              problem has developed hand in hand with the developing economy.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Waste Framework Directive establishes a
              framework for the safe management of waste. In Northern Ireland
              the primary legislation necessary to transpose the requirements of
              the Directive is contained in the Waste and Contaminated Land
              (Northern Ireland) Order 1997. However, full compliance will also
              require a phased programme of subordinate legislation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first stage in the implementation of that
              programme was the introduction of the Controlled Waste
              (Registration of Carriers and Seizure of Vehicles) Regulations
              (Northern Ireland) 1999. They require persons or companies
              carrying or transferring controlled waste to register with the
              Department.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second stage will be the implementation of
              a duty of care on any person who imports, produces, carries,
              keeps, treats or disposes of controlled waste. A consultation
              paper on the duty of care was issued on 14 November 2001, and it
              is hoped that the legislation will be operational in May or June
              this year.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The third stage in the programme will be the
              introduction of a new waste management licensing system. Under
              that system, my Department will issue licences authorising the
              treatment, keeping or disposal of controlled waste. Those licences
              will replace the waste disposal licences currently issued by
              district councils under the Pollution Control and Local Government
              (Northern Ireland) Order 1978. Consultation on the licensing
              proposals is scheduled to take place in the next few months, with
              a view to the system’s being operational by the end of 2003.</p>

              plastic bags are a significant part of that problem. I am watching
              with interest what happens in the South, where Minister Dempsey
              introduced legislation to deal with plastic bags. His levy will
              raise funds to help tackle litter.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, more important than where the funds go
              is the public’s attitude to waste generally, whether that is
              litter, plastic bags or major forms of litter. Unfortunately,
              taxes are a UK-wide matter. Northern Ireland is part of the United
              Kingdom, and it has no powers to adopt a similar levy
              independently. Therefore, there are no plans at present to deal
              with plastic bags. However, I will be monitoring the situation in
              the South, and if we think that it would be helpful, it could be
              raised at a United Kingdom level.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Kane:</p>
              </font></b><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are now supposed to have joined-up
              government. On the one hand, we have a Department pushing like mad
              for rural development, and on the other, an education and library
              board that is responsible to another Department, which is
              determined to close a rural village school. I ask the Minister of
              Education and his Department — is that not a contradiction of
              policy? On what grounds can the education and library board
              justify closure?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We talk about social and economic deprivation.
              What greater social need can there be than the need for education
              for the growing and close-knit community of Mosside? All 108 MLAs
              should be fighting tooth and nail to keep all schools in rural
              communities open in order to preserve them for future generations.
              The North Eastern Education and Library Board (NEELB) is taking
              away the very fabric of society that exists in a rural community
              and does not exist elsewhere.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The NEELB appears to have had a complete
              disregard for the facts in reaching its decision to close Mosside
              Primary School. The extensive new build programme in the village
              and the creation of new commercial ventures in the Mosside area
              are significant reasons to keep Mosside Primary School open. Those
              factors have been overlooked in the decision-making process. Has
              the NEELB taken those factors into consideration, or is it too
              short-sighted?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept that a reduction in the number of
              children of primary school age can lead to falling class sizes,
              which in turn leads to inefficiency in the provision of primary
              school education. Bearing in mind the pointers that suggest that
              the trend is for more youngsters in the village, I am perplexed by
              the proposed closure of Mosside Primary School. The potential is
              there in Mosside. Support for rural sustainability means having
              local primary education. The population and potential for an
              increase in numbers of children of primary school age is there.
              The decision to close the village primary school is therefore
              premature and poorly thought through.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some parents in the village take their children
              to other schools, thus not supporting the outstanding teaching
              qualities available at Mosside Primary School. However, I
              congratulate the principal and her staff on those outstanding
              qualities. The NEELB should put the recommended closure of the
              school on hold and begin a public relations exercise in the
              community to encourage parents and children to return to Mosside
              Primary School. That would be a great asset to the community and a
              positive step forward.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Teaching staff, the board of governors and
              parents inform me that the performance rate of children at Mosside
              Primary School far outstrips the performance rate of children at
              larger schools. That is a great achievement, and it is a major
              challenge for the board to have the school kept open. It
              constitutes a significant factor in the decision that, ultimately,
              should be to keep Mosside Primary School open for business.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have been strongly petitioned by parents and
              members of local churches to resist the closure of the school as
              it is a focal point for young and old. The parents, children and
              the entire community are very much aware of the value of the
              school. There seems to be a disregard in the proposed decision to
              close the school as it provides convenience for working parents
              living in the village and surrounding area, and continuity in
              first-class primary school education for children.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Schools that have closed in the area in recent
              years include Cloghcorr, Cloghanmurry, Tullybane, Drumtullagh,
              Giant’s Causeway, Croaghbeg, Kirkhills, Ballintoy and Moyarget.
              Although the circumstances of the declining attendances were
              compelling at the time, the detachment of children and young
              people from their community is evident. I must caution Members
              that this has not been an encouraging development in many cases.
              We must provide our children and young people with a sense of
              belonging and a sense of identity for them to prosper and become
              contributors to their society. We can do this in Mosside, and we
              must not ignore the opportunity. The future of Mosside Primary
              School depends on the support of the House to prevent the closure.
              Neither I nor other Assembly Members can begin to quantify the
              social damage that primary school closures inflict on rural
              communities.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Paisley Jnr:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate my Colleague on securing the
              debate today. It is an important debate because it goes to the
              heart of Government policy; it also goes to the heart of what we
              want for our community and for this society. Schools are a
              cornerstone of society, and in rural areas where there is
              remoteness and lack of choice, it is essential that the heart is
              not ripped out of the local community. That issue must not be lost
              in the House.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many people will argue that this is about
              resources, but the reality is that the school has been well
              resourced. In fact, one could argue that it is one of the best
              equipped schools in the area. Therefore it would be a double
              scandal to remove the teachers and the resources and equipment
              from the school. Today I saw a report listing the equipment in the
              school. For such a small school it is not short of modern
              technology. There are six personal computers, two laptops, two
              televisions, two videos, five printers, three data projectors and
              a hi-fi system. The Internet is available to every classroom as
              well as the assembly hall. The classes are obviously small due to
              the dwindling number of pupils who have enrolled. However, that
              means that there is more time allocated to each pupil and that
              there is a better teacher/pupil ratio than in many other schools.
              Therefore it can be argued — and shown — that the children are
              well catered for in this area.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fabric of the building is also very good.
              The recent installation of double-glazed windows and a new central
              heating system; the construction of a principal’s office and the
              replacement of sanitary ware have left the school in tip-top
              condition. There have been improvements and special conditions put
              in place for children with special needs. There is now a special
              needs classroom that has been completely refurbished with a new
              roof, carpeting, curtains and a heating system. In relation to the
              entire fabric, therefore, the school is probably one of the best
              catered for and maintained primary schools in the vicinity. It
              would be a double scandal to rip up that good work by no longer
              using a well catered for school and by asking the children to go
              elsewhere.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I said at the beginning, this is not just a
              question of resources; it is a question of Government policy. It
              is essential that Government policy allows for choice in rural
              areas. People in areas that could be left remote or without choice
              should be given the choice to attend a local primary school. We
              have seen that choice given to other schools, such as Irish-medium
              schools. Government policy for Irish-medium schools shows that
              where a school has 12 pupils or more, it can be considered for
              funding. This school is not an Irish-medium school, but surely it
              is entitled to the same rights. If Irish-medium schools with 12
              pupils are entitled to funding, then Mosside, which has seen a
              dwindling in its numbers, should also be entitled to proper
              funding.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to identify some of the reasons for the
              dwindling numbers in the area. In 1988 there were 72 enrolments,
              and last year there were 13. The tapering downwards of the number
              of enrolments seemed to start between 1996 and 1998. It fell from
              34 to 22 in the year beginning 1999. I suggest that the reason for
              that is the uncertainty placed at the heart of the future of the
              school. That uncertainty started with a rumour that the school
              would not last due to dwindling numbers. As a result, parents have
              panicked and decided to register their children for pre-school
              education in other local schools, so that they can get the next
              best school. That rumour has damaged the availability of pupils to
              enrol in the area.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The one thing that the Department could do is
              give certainty back to the school and say that it will stay open.
              We would then see enrolment increasing because parents would be
              confidentthat their children would be at the school for several
              years to get their education before going on to secondary level
              education. The rumours should be quashed, and the Assembly and
              Department can help to do that by saying that they will give
              certainty back to the school. It is not an unprecedented request;
              the Minister of Education, who is here for the debate, made such
              announcements before. He has done it for two other schools. He
              indicated that Toberlane and Churchtown Primary Schools would stay
              open even though they do not reach the same criterion. Most
              Members will know that the criterion is that if a school does not
              have 25 pupils for enrolment, it can be earmarked for closure.
              Those schools had 25 and 24 pupils respectively, yet they were not
              earmarked for closure. In his public statement of 6 December 2000,
              the Minister recognised that to close them would be unfair and
              would disadvantage people in a rural community.</p>
              <i>

              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the argument stands for areas such as
              Cookstown, it stands for areas in north Antrim. The same criteria
              used for that decision should be applied in this case. To close
              Mosside Primary School because it has not reached the enrolment
              criteria last year and this year is not good enough. The school
              needs to be given a chance.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Colleague Mr Kane talked about local
              development, and there are major planning developments in the
              locality that will see a development of the village and an
              increase in people who will want to live in areas that have been
              depleted because of changes in farming and in the locality. Those
              people will want a local school for their children. If there is no
              local school, they will not want to live there and will go
              elsewhere. They will want to live in a town or village that does
              have a local school. We need to encourage people to stay in the
              area.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another Government agency, namely the Planning
              Service, has taken decisions to allow building in the village to
              keep the village whole, instead of seeing a dwindling population.
              People will then go to that village and see the cornerstones of
              the local village, such as the local church, the local school and
              the local shops. I hope that the principles that were applied to
              Toberlane and Churchtown Primary Schools will also apply to
              Mosside Primary School.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are peaks and troughs in enrolment, and
              there is a trough at the moment because of the birth rates in the
              area. There will be peaks in the future, and it is essential that
              we cater for them and be ready, instead of ensuring that they can
              never be catered for by closing the local rural school. It is
              essential that parents have choice. To close a rural school and
              reduce parents’ choice is not a good policy or principle upon
              which to devise education provision.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue has not only been raised at local
              community level, at the local council, and in the form of a
              petition which I presented to the House, but also by many people
              who have indicated their strong desire not to see another rural
              community decimated by a decision that will damage the fabric of
              that rural society. It is important that the plea go up from the
              House to maintain that school and to apply the same principles in
              operation elsewhere to allow the school to continue, and also to
              make sure that discrimination does not creep in. It could be
              argued that discrimination has been allowed to creep in through
              other policies. The Department of Education has the responsibility
              to demonstrate to this rural community in a part of Protestant
              Ulster that they deserve their rights and are entitled to the same
              rights as others in that locality.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All public representatives have seen rural
              schools closed before. All sorts of arguments were put forward.
              First, we were told that the buildings were not manageable; that
              they had been built years ago and had deteriorated and that a new
              school would be required. I am glad to report that Mosside has a
              good building. The issue does not relate to the building — an
              excuse which has been made on many occasions by those who were
              intent on ruthlessly carrying out a policy of closing down rural
              schools. Small rural communities are vital contributors to life
              both locally and Province-wide.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was amazed by the figures produced by a
              recent inquiry into relative deprivation by the centre for urban
              policy studies at Manchester University. That inquiry reported the
              shocking statistic that 76% of residents in Mosside over the age
              of 16 have no formal educational qualifications. If they are to
              gain formal educational qualifications, they must have a good
              primary education.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, Mosside Primary School has a good
              building, so the Department would not have to spend a vast sum on
              a new building or renovations. Secondly, it is a good school. All
              the parents and community members wish me, as an MLA and MP for
              the area, to express thanks to the teachers and the principal of
              the school. They have done, and continue to do, a good job.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue is represented across the board. An
              Ulster Unionist councillor, Helen Harding, who is a former pupil
              of the school, has pledged to fully support the campaign to keep
              it open. An SDLP councillor, Madeline Black, said that it is vital
              that such communities have a primary school, which is necessary
              for children’s stability. Therefore, it is not just one section
              of the community that is crying loudly for the maintenance of the
              school; every section with pupils at the school is represented.
              The community has a united voice.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Schools and churches cement a community
              together. If the cement is taken away, the community will
              disintegrate. Communities in Ulster are in danger of
              disintegrating. Schools have been removed from other rural
              districts that used to have real communities, to which people were
              pleased to belong, and that enjoyed a neighbourliness that was
              begotten of people’s sense of community. Those communities have
              completely disintegrated because the cement has been taken away.
              Children who are brought up and educated together share a closer
              bond than those who are educated separately. Therefore, there is a
              danger of destroying a community that is vital to the betterment
              of that area of north Antrim.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not understand why we plan to build so
              many new houses in the area and then tell people that there will
              be no school. Anyone with experience of such schools knows that
              enrolment statistics vary. The unfavourable statistics of some
              schools have been reversed because of an increase in the intake of
              pupils. That must be considered when deciding whether to close a
              school. New houses are being built, and people are moving to the
              area, including some who were forced to leave before because of
              housing difficulties. They wish to live in the area in which they
              were brought up.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People who speak for rural districts understand
              that well. I do not know why some statistics should be played to
              the full, when other statistics point to a rise in the number of
              children. At first there was panic when it was whispered that this
              school would close. Then parents worried about where their
              children were going to go. They naturally wanted to get their
              children into the nearest school and into the school that they
              calculated to be the best.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once there is a rumour in an area that a school
              is going to close, there is panic among parents. They have been
              telling me that they are worried that all the children will have
              to be bused away. I do not think that any mother or father is keen
              to see children leave home earlier in the morning than they should
              have to do because of the distance that they must travel to the
              new school. One mother told me that it will be a long and tiring
              day for her youngest child, who will have to catch a bus at around
              8.30 in the morning and will not return home till long after 3.00
              pm. That is not right.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly must remember that those children
              are growing up and should not have to depend on such a busing
              system to get a primary education. That could be avoided if the
              school were maintained. If it is announced tomorrow that the
              school is to stay open many parents who have already made
              alternative arrangements will go back on them to keep their
              children at the local school.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly must address those difficulties.
              The best thing to do is to give the school a chance to continue to
              do its work. Members are pleading for that chance because the
              results of closing it will be dire. It will tear the heart out of
              the community and lead in some measure to its disintegration. All
              those matters and the points that my Colleagues put before the
              House mount up to a strong plea to give Mosside&nbsp;Primary&nbsp;School
              the chance to survive — indeed, the chance not only to survive,
              but also to succeed.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Education (Mr M McGuinness):</b>
              A LeasCheann Comhairle. Members will be aware that the North
              Eastern Education and Library Board published a development
              proposal on 31&nbsp;January to close Mosside
              Controlled&nbsp;Primary&nbsp;School with effect from
              August&nbsp;2002.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under the legislative provisions there is a
              two-month period following this publication during which
              objections can be sent to the Department of Education before a
              decision is taken on the proposal. As that period has now expired,
              I will be examining the details of the case soon, with a view to
              taking a decision quickly. That is necessary to remove any
              uncertainty on the part of the school, parents and pupils
              regarding educational plans that will have to be finalised soon
              for the next school year.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While I have not yet determined the outcome of
              that matter, it may be helpful if I outline to Members the various
              factors that I will consider as part of my examination of the
              closure proposal. They include the pattern of enrolments at
              Mosside&nbsp;Primary. I understand that there are presently
              13&nbsp;pupils in attendance.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must also consider educational factors, such
              as the balance and delivery of the curriculum and the proximity of
              neighbouring schools. There are four other controlled schools
              within a five-mile radius of Mosside Primary School. We must also
              look at surplus places in other schools and the social, economic
              and community issues, which several Members raised.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.30 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am on record as emphasising the importance of
              a strong network of rural schools as part of the infrastructure to
              reinforce rural communities. However, although it is important to
              retain relationships between schools and their communities, there
              are circumstances in which the burden on teachers to deliver the
              curriculum in very small schools across a whole range of age
              groups and abilities is excessive. Ian Paisley Jnr mentioned the
              situation at Churchtown and Toberlane controlled schools. In those
              cases, I made it clear then that there are circumstances when
              change is needed when the burden on teachers to deliver the
              curriculum is such circumstances is excessive.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must also look at the condition of school
              premises. Objections to and representations on the proposal are
              other factors that we must consider. There were three objections
              to the proposed closure of Mosside, two of which came from the
              school’s board of governors and Moyle District Council.
              Furthermore, Ian Paisley Jnr laid a petition in the Assembly
              during the two-month objection period. That petition has been
              treated as a formal objection. Members can see that I must
              carefully examine a range of issues before I can make an informed
              judgment on the matter.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ian Paisley Jnr also mentioned the funding
              criteria for Irish-medium schools. That also affects integrated
              schools. The reference to the figures acknowledges the lowering of
              the viability criteria, a decision that I took last year to make
              it easier for integrated and Irish-medium schools to become
              established. Support is given to those schools only when my
              Department and I are convinced that the proposals are robust and
              that the schools will go from strength to strength. In almost 100%
              of cases, those schools have gone from strength to strength. They
              have not failed. Indeed, enrolment numbers have increased rather
              than decreased.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was interesting that Ian Paisley Jnr used
              the argument about Protestant Ulster. I do not think that Ulster
              is Protestant. Ulster is full of Catholics, Protestants and
              Dissenters, and we are all the better for it. We should not
              attempt to sectarianise the argument. Any decisions that are taken
              on schools, especially small rural schools, must be based on what
              is best for the education of pupils in those areas.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All aspects of the arguments for and against
              the proposed closure of the school will be considered. The
              overriding objective is to determine a way forward that is in the
              best educational interests of all the pupils. I am on record as
              saying that I value highly the contribution that small rural
              schools make to society, especially as much of our geographic area
              is rural.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The arguments against closure are not lost on
              me — I sympathise considerably with all the points that have
              been made by the three Members who spoke. However, we must also
              recognise that all cases must be judged on their merits. There are
              13 pupils at Mosside Primary School. In all likelihood, there may
              be only 10 pupils next year. The numbers are declining. People can
              say that there is a historical explanation for that. Before this
              institution was established, there were rumours in Mosside that
              the school was in difficulty and numbers were dwindling. Those
              circumstances were well beyond my control. If there was any
              validity in those rumours, we were effectively left with that
              legacy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A decision will be taken shortly, and I shall
              consider carefully the points that have been made before I make an
              announcement.</p>
