		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The Assembly met at 10.30 am (Mr Speaker in the  Chair).</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
		    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="1"></a>ministerial statement</p>
		    <p class="H4StageHeading">British-Irish Council &nbsp;Demography Sectoral Meeting</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have received notice from the Minister for Employment and Learning that he  wishes to make a statement on the outcome of the British-Irish Council  demography sectoral meeting.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning (Sir Reg Empey)</strong>: The first ministerial demographic sectoral  meeting of the British-Irish Council (BIC)  was held in Edin&shy;burgh on 31 March 2008. My statement will provide an  outline of the meeting that has been agreed with junior Minister Kelly, who  also attended. As Minister for Employment and Learning, with lead  responsibility for migrant workers, I was  delighted to attend the successful sectoral meeting, which provided an  opportunity for useful discussion on a wide range of issues across  Administrations. I am grateful to junior Minister Kelly for agreeing to be the  accompanying Minister.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As the Scottish  Government are the lead Admin&shy;istration on demography in the Council,  the Deputy First Minister and Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing for Scotland, Nicola  Sturgeon MSP, hosted and chaired the meeting. The British Government were  represented by the Secretary of State for Wales, the Rt Hon Paul Murphy MP.  The Irish Government were represented by the Minister of State, Tom Kitt TD.  The Welsh Assembly Government were represented by the First Minister, the Rt  Hon Rhodri Morgan AM. The Northern Ireland Executive were represented by junior  Minister Kelly and me. The Government of Guernsey  were represented by the Deputy Minister for  Commerce and Employment, Carla McNulty Bauer. The Isle   of Man Government were represented by the Minister for Trade and  Industry, D C Cretney MHK, and the Jersey Government by the Minister for  Economic Development, Senator Philip Francis Cyril Ozouf.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A series of four papers was considered: an update paper  that outlined the demography work stream&rsquo;s current progress; a paper that  compared demographic trends and measures across the Administrations that  participate in the British-Irish Council; a paper that compared migration  trends and policies across those Administrations; and a paper that outlined  possible projects to be included in the work stream in future. The Scottish  Government presented the four papers.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The first paper summarised the five meetings held so far.  Topics covered at those meetings were urgent policies and research in the  different Administrations and migration  reform in the United Kingdom.  Ministers approved the demography  work stream&rsquo;s progress, which includes the sharing of the different  Administrations&rsquo; current policy and research information, as well as information on migration reform in the United Kingdom.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The second paper specifically covered recent  population-growth trends; population projections over the next 25 years; the  current and projected age structures of the populations; life expectancy;  fertility rates; and migration trends. All  those were acknowledged by Ministers, who also discussed policy  implications of those different demographic trends and measures. They agreed  that the British-Irish Council demography sectoral group should develop further  work plans on migration issues.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The third paper set out the different migration trends  experienced by the Administrations, their existing migration policies, and any  planned changes to those policies. Ministers discussed the successes and  lessons that have been learnt from the different policies in encouraging or  constraining migration. A key point that was highlighted was the need for  integration of migrant communities.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The fourth paper outlined the group&rsquo;s future plans, which  include investigating healthy independent ageing, and its implications for the  provision of care for the elderly; examining the effectiveness of policy  interventions on demographic trends; investigating fertility trends and their  implications; understanding the impacts of migration; and the implications of  wider student flows among BIC member Administrations. Ministers also recognised  the need for more reliable information on current and future trends to be made  available, and they expressed a common aim of producing flexible migration  policy to match job shortages. They proposed to progress work on the impact of  opening the EU labour markets on flows of migrants to BIC member  Administrations.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Ministers supported in principle the plans set out in the  paper and proposed the following work plans: understanding migration and its  impact; healthy independent ageing; implications of wider student flows among BIC member administrations;  investigating fertility trends; and examining the effectiveness of policy  interventions on demographic trends. Ministers also suggested that comparisons  with other countries be made.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Employment and Learning (Ms S Ramsey)</strong>: Go raibh maith  agat. I thank the Minister for his statement. It is important that Members hear  about the work of the British-Irish Council, especially its work on population  trends. Migration, and its impact on the labour market, is a critical issue,  and, as the Minister highlighted, that research must continue to inform policy.  It is also extremely important that information be shared among participating  Administrations. We can learn lessons from one other.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister mentioned a number of research work streams to  which the participating Administrations have an input. Has anything unique to  our experiences in the North emerged from the population research? Go raibh  maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Sir Reg Empey</strong>:  I thank the Committee Chairperson for her questions. She asked whether there is  anything unique in our experiences. Each Administration has different  statistics, and one issue that was discussed at length &mdash; and Paul Murphy, who  represented the United Kingdom Government, was a key player in this matter &mdash; is  the need for accurate information. That is part of the difficulty.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Given that people are entitled to benefits after living  here for a year, at present, someone who comes to Northern Ireland from, for example,  one of the A8 accession countries will probably register voluntarily in order  to prove the length of time that they have been here. However, if that person  were to leave before that year were out, there would be no record of their  stay. The problem is that we do not know how many people we have. Therefore, we  must first compile accurate statistics. Work has been done to try to establish  how many people we have, because that has huge implications for future policy  making.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">According to the statistics that we have for each  Administration, our unique profile shows a population that is slightly younger  than those of GB and some of the islands. As far as we can assess, we have  greater inflows of migrants than some Administrations, but smaller inflows than  others. Basically, the papers that were provided at the meeting contain tables  that rank the different Administrations according to the inflows and outflows  of population that they are believed to have. Moreover, an age profile of each  population was tabulated, and that was used to anticipate, as I mentioned, a  healthy ageing population and any care facilities that we will need in the future.  Northern Ireland  has a unique population footprint. However, that is accompanied by a health  warning, because the statistics are anything but reliable. That is why we must  make an effort to get better information.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>:  First, immigration will have a huge impact on the student population in Northern Ireland.  Will the Minister enlighten the Assembly on the ways in which further-education  colleges and universities in other jurisdictions have coped with immigration?  What guidance has he given to our further  education colleges and universities to ensure that immigrant students  have all the facilities that they require?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, given reports &mdash; not least those from my  constituency of East Antrim &mdash; that some migrant workers have been exploited,  will the Minister outline what steps have been taken in other jurisdictions to  ensure that such exploitation does not happen? What guidance has his Department  given to employers in Northern Ireland to ensure that it does not happen here?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Sir Reg Empey</strong>:  The Member will have heard me refer to student flows within the  Administrations. That is a matter of particular interest and concern in Northern Ireland.  Members will be aware that the Department for Employment and Learning is  proactive in trying to bring back some of the students that we lose. Between  25% and 30% of our students in full-time higher education attend institutions  outside Northern Ireland,  so it is a big issue for us. It is also a big issue for some of the other  smaller Administrations whose choice of further and higher education is limited  by their size.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I assure the Member that I am particularly keen on further  and higher education, because there is absolutely no doubt that we are  haemorrhaging those who have the skills that we need. If, as a result of  efforts that are made at the economic conference next month, the chief  executive officers of companies seek to invest here, one concern will be  whether we have people with the skills to do the work, or whether we can train  them. Such a skills base will be one of the key elements in sustaining our  economy in the future.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Members have expressed their concerns in the Chamber on  several occasions about employers exploiting migrant workers. They will know  that we are introducing and strengthening measures to protect people&rsquo;s rights.  However, we must go back to basics first and establish who is here, the long  term trends, and the implications for housing, health and shared resources.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We must adopt a back-to-basics approach to ensure that the  statistics are correct in the first place.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">10.45 am</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McClarty</strong>: I thank the Minister for his statement. Will he outline the  areas considered by the working group on demography?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Sir Reg Empey</strong>:  Junior Minister Kelly and I returned from the meeting with a proposed work  stream. Some issues are cross-cutting and, therefore, I have sent papers to  Executive colleagues seeking their agreement.  During the meeting, we made a commitment in principle only and made it  clear that we wanted the approval of the Executive. If they agree, there will  be four main areas under consideration.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We must determine accurate numbers of those involved in each jurisdiction. It is important to  anticipate the inflow and the outflow; it is a circulating process that  will have huge implications for the labour market. We are relying on anecdotal  evidence. Trends can change rapidly, and the biggest example of change in  recent months has been the exchange rate. The euro has strengthened against the  pound and, therefore, the financial advantage of working in Northern Ireland  has decreased. I am sure that the Minister of Finance and Personnel will know  that figure to three decimal points, but I think that it is approximately 17%  or 18%. That has had a huge impact on earnings. Also, other economies are  improving, and the Polish Government, among  others, are trying to recover people. Incidentally, I notice that the  Minister for Finance and Personnel did not outline the exact figure.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We must examine healthy-ageing issues. In many of the jurisdictions, the number of older people is  increasing, and, in some areas, the population is not replenishing  itself. That has implications for future resources. What will happen to health  and care services if people live longer? Scotland has suffered significant  emigration in recent years, and the Scottish Administration have a policy to  increase the population.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Student flow is another  area under consideration that has significant implications here. We must  examine fertility trends because, if the population is not being replenished,  that might have a major social and economic impact. How would business and  industry survive without immigrant labour? All of those factors have a social  implication downstream, and, to some extent, it is the elephant in the room,  which Members are reluctant to discuss. However, there is no profit in not  addressing these issues. If tensions were to develop because people were  following the same scarce resources &mdash; be it housing or health services &mdash; then  we could run into difficulties. An advantage of this work is that we can  anticipate problems and plan to avoid them.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I welcome the report of the first demography sectoral meeting of the BIC. As  the Minister has outlined, the progress of this work will be important for the  health of the population in all member states.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My question, however, relates to the communiqu&eacute; issued  after the meeting. Under the heading &ldquo;Demography Workstream Future Work Plan&rdquo;,  it states that Ministers:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;proposed that work be  progressed on the impact of opening of EU labour markets on flows of migrants  to the BIC Member Administrations.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is a healthy proposal. However, does the  Minister acknowledge the tension between all member Administrations progressing  that work and an individual Administration independently advancing proposals to  deal with the flow of migrants into its state? For example, the Irish  Government have introduced proposals &mdash; considered by some to be draconian in certain  areas &mdash;on migrants entering the Republic   of Ireland. Their  proposals could adversely affect the operation of the border on this island.  Does the Minister acknowledge that tension and the fact that the Republic of Ireland&rsquo;s introduction of such proposals  could have an impact on the work stream? Has the Minister had any conversations  with the Irish Government about their proposals?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Sir Reg Empey</strong>:  I thank the Member for his question. He used the term &ldquo;draconian&rdquo; to describe  the Irish Government&rsquo;s proposals. The genesis of those proposals was the  meeting of the BIC in this Building in July 2007. During a general discussion,  the Scottish Administration and the Irish Government raised the issue of  demography and migration trends. At that stage, it was clear, particularly from  what the Irish Government representative Minister Miche&aacute;l Martin said, that the  Irish Government were greatly concerned about the implications of a future  economic downturn.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We must bear in mind  that approximately 10% or 11% of the workforce in the Irish Republic  is of non-Irish origin, and, therefore, migration is a huge issue. Members will  know that when I met my counterparts at the beginning of the school term in  September 2007, a significant case was highlighted: in a school that opened  outside Dublin,  every pupil was black. That had never happened before, and it was causing great  concern. Since the summer of 2007, it has been clear that the Irish Government  have major concerns.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I take the Member&rsquo;s point that the unilateral action of an  Administration makes the work of the group more difficult. The Administrations  agree to undertake the work together but, at the end of the day, each  Administration is master of its own house. Thus, there is no binding  requirement on Administrations to conform or to constrain their policies.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, the Member will be aware that in the first three  months of 2008, some 28,000 jobs were lost in the Republic &mdash; the most rapid  loss of jobs there in the past 30 years. That is having an impact and, reading  between the lines, the Irish Government anticipated such a loss in the summer  of 2007. They are greatly concerned about  migrant labour because of the potential social tensions that it may  create.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am acutely aware of the issues that the Member raised, and I briefly discussed the situation  with Tom Kitt on the margins of the meeting. He gave a presentation,  and, during the free-flowing discussion that followed, some of those issues  emerged as matters of major concern.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In Northern    Ireland, approximately 5% of the workforce  could be deemed to come from non-local backgrounds. Migrant workers make up  more than twice that percentage of the workforce in the Republic. Members will  appreciate, therefore, why it is such an important issue for the Irish  Government.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement. I particularly welcome the work plan on  understanding migration and its impact. It is important to get the facts and  figures right, because there have been a number of conflicting research reports  on the merits of migration. It is important that public-sector bodies are  informed of those facts and figures so that migrant workers and their families are not made scapegoats for coming  here.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I remind the Minister that a very good report was produced  in Northern Ireland  through the Racial Equality Forum and its migrant workers thematic subgroup. I  understand from the Minister&rsquo;s previous statement that that report, which would  contribute to the overall work plan, is with the Executive.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Sir Reg Empey</strong>:  I thank the Member for her contribution. I am aware of the forum&rsquo;s work. One of  the reasons why the demography group exists and why the Scottish Government &mdash;  whose First Minister proposed it at the  British-Irish Council last July &mdash; were so keen to lead it, is that all  of the Administrations involved are concerned that migrant workers should not  be made scapegoats. That is exactly what we do not want to happen. I take  comfort from the fact that all the Administrations are discussing the issues,  because there is no point in waiting until problems occur. The Member is  correct in saying that that is why the information is needed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to outline some of the research and data-gathering  issues that we are looking at, because it is important that that is done.  Questions about public attitudes to, and perceptions of, migrant workers were  included in the Northern Ireland  omnibus survey and the Northern    Ireland life and times survey, which have been published on my Department&rsquo;s website. A  contract has been awarded for a survey of migrant workers in Northern Ireland, to discover their experiences  of employment, of settling in Northern    Ireland and any indication of their  intentions.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, the Department for Employment and Learning  (DEL) plans to commission research on the impact of migrant workers on the  economy and labour market in Northern    Ireland. That is obviously a highly  contentious issue, and recent reports will have drawn Members&rsquo; attention to  that. The Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency, which is involved  with the Office for National Statistics and is represented on various national  committees, is represented on the migrant workers thematic subgroup, and so  provides that subgroup with up-to-date information on national policy and processes regarding statistics and data  sources.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member can be assured that we are taking steps &mdash;  independently and with others &mdash; to try and obtain that information. We are also  trying to assess the experience of migrant workers and their families and  analyse that experience from their point of view, to understand how they view  their circumstances, and from that of others. We can make a sound judgement  only when we have that information.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Newton</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement. On learning that he was due to make the  statement, I was sad enough to spend my time looking up the report from the ministerial meeting of the British-Irish  Council on demography. I imagine that, given the content of the various  reports, there will be a great clamour from members of the Committee for  Employment and Learning to be represented at the next meeting of that group,  when it is announced.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister share my concern and that of others that  the figures in the statistical study of the population are out-of-date and  inaccurate? The known extent of illegal entry into the UK is clouded  by a great number of issues.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister comment on the implications that that  will have for his Department&rsquo;s ability to plan for further education and for  solutions to skills shortages?</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">11.00 am</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Sir Reg Empey</strong>:  I do not think that it is sad of a Member to look up details of the meeting of  the ministerial demography group. Indeed, it is perfectly natural &mdash; what else  would one do on a Sunday?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I share the Member&rsquo;s concerns. He has correctly identified  the issue: we do not know for certain how many non-nationals there are in Northern Ireland.  The rules of the European Union mean that non-nationals register only on a  voluntary basis, to prove that they have been here for a year and are therefore  entitled to claim benefits and so on if required.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Secretary of State for Wales,  who was representing the British Government, was questioned for some time on  the issue of illegal entry into the UK. It was clear that there is huge  anxiety in Whitehall  about that issue. Indeed, I detected a hardening of attitudes towards  immigration, particularly from non-EU sources, and I believe that policies on  that matter will become progressively more aggressive.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">To some extent, I perhaps missed a point that Mr Ross made  earlier about the implications of immigration for further education and so on.  My Department is being forced to spend substantially larger sums of money on,  for example, teaching English as a second language. That is something that we  cannot accurately budget for, because statistics do not exist. We simply rely  on people turning up for such courses. That creates difficulties.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In the past three years the amount of money that has been  spent on such courses has increased from &pound;300,000 to &pound;1&middot;5 million. We have had  to spend that without the ability to accurately budget for it. The Minister of  Finance tells us that we have to make plans and so on, but my Department is  unable to do that because we simply do not know how many people are going to show  up for those courses, which means that we have to basically pay in arrears.  That is one of the weaknesses in the figures. I accept that the figures are out  of date.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The issue of illegal entry into Northern Ireland is of great  concern &mdash; we simply do not know how many people have entered the country  illegally. All of the evidence that has  been produced nationally has consis&shy;tently underestimated the number of  illegal entrants. Governments are simply fooling themselves if they continue  with such practices. We are going to make a genuine effort to improve the  statistical information, for the obvious reasons that the Member identified.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I welcome the work of the BIC, and I  am glad to hear that junior Minister Gerry Kelly attended the meeting and that  he is establishing good relations with our Celtic cousins. Does the Minister  agree that sharing our experiences and research with our Celtic neighbours on  issues such as migrant workers benefits us all, particularly in ensuring that  migrant workers are not exploited and paid less than the going rate?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, does he agree that the work of the Scottish  Parliament, which is reflected in how it is performing, and about which we have  all received positive information and reports, shows us what an Assembly can do  when it has more control over its destiny and more powers?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Sir Reg Empey</strong>:  I thought that the Member was going to say that she was supporting Celtic  Football Club, but she did not go that far.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to remember that the experience of the  Scottish population in recent years has been different from ours. Scotland&rsquo;s  population has been falling for a number of years, and there has been a large  outflow of people.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Scottish Government are attempting to reverse that  trend. Unless the situation changes, the long-term economic implications are  that Scotland&rsquo;s  economic productivity will decrease.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Scottish people sought devolution for a long time, and  it is only natural that they want their Parliament to produce results. The  Assembly should be mindful of that. All of us will need to raise our game and  try to produce more results for our community.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The issue of the exploitation of workers has been debated  in the Chamber several times recently. Ms Anderson and other Members expressed  concerns about that matter. The legal powers of the Department are being  strengthened in order to deal with any employment agency or business that might  try to exploit people.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department for Employment and Learning now has the  power to inspect the books of any employment agency or business. An inspector  has been employed and is currently out in the field, visiting agencies or  businesses at random, or following up complaints. The legal position is also  changing &mdash; people can be taken to court and fined very heavily, or could have  their licences suspended.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I assure the Member that my Department will continue to  take the issue of exploitation extremely seriously. He is not currently in the  Chamber, but the Member for East Antrim Mr Sammy Wilson raised the issue of a  migrant worker who was being exploited in rented accommodation. The Department  now has the power to deal with cases in which employers require people who are  seeking work to occupy certain accommodation. Workers can now withdraw from  such contracts, and they must be informed in writing by employers that they  have the right to do so.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">If Mr Wilson or any other Member has examples of &mdash; or  concerns about &mdash; the maltreatment of workers, I would appreciate those being  brought to my attention.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his state&shy;ment,  which was comprehensive and detailed. On behalf of the Northern Ireland  Executive, does the Minister intend to  follow the lead that has been set by the Scottish Executive with respect  to encouraging immigration by highly skilled people &mdash; particularly graduates  and people with specialist skills &mdash; who might boost the regional  entrepreneurship of Northern    Ireland?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Sir Reg Empey</strong>:  I thank the Member for his question. I have received a number of requests from  employers for assistance in approaching the Home Office with regard to  obtaining appropriate licences for certain workers to come to Northern Ireland.  Requests were recently made to the Home Office on behalf of a meat plant to  allow a number of Brazilian workers to work here. Some businesses tell us that  they do not have enough graduates in certain disciplines or do not have enough  people with certain skills at graduate or postgraduate level.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As part of a departmental initiative, DEL  represent&shy;atives will attend a number of job fairs this year, initially in Great Britain.  We will probably eventually attend job fairs in Dublin. That initiative is designed to  encourage the private sector to co-operate with us. The Department will attend  two job fairs in Scotland  next month, together with representative of companies that are experiencing  staff shortages. Those companies will be offering real jobs, and we will be  attending student fairs in an effort to attract to Northern Ireland people whom employers  are seeking. The Department will be supported in those efforts by a number of  employment and recruitment agencies.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The programme will be ongoing over the next year or two to  see whether the problem can be fixed. However, I stress that it is coming at  different ends of the labour market; there is no single pattern. It can arise  owing to shortages in a meat plant or shortages of highly qualified  researchers. It covers a broad range.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to entrepreneurship, several companies tell me  that they would not be able to sustain and develop their businesses without the  assistances of persons outwith our current labour force.</p>
		    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="2"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
		    <p class="H4StageHeading">Performance and Efficiency Delivery Unit (PEDU)</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have received notice from the Minister of Finance and Personnel that he  wishes to make a statement on details of the performance and efficiency  delivery unit.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel (Mr P Robinson)</strong>: With permission, I wish to make a statement  on the performance and efficiency delivery unit (PEDU). In particular, I want  to take this opportunity to provide a little more detail on what PEDU will and  will not do, but, first, let me reflect a little on the recent Programme for  Government and Budget.</p>
		    <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Molloy] in the Chair)</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">When I presented the new Executive&rsquo;s first Budget to the  Assembly in January 2008, I stressed two key themes. The first of those is  efficiency. Instead of simply increasing the tax burden on households and  businesses, we decided to help fund new priorities by becoming much more  efficient. That gave householders welcome relief from snowballing rates bills,  and it also offered the prospect of additional investment for new and improved  public services.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The second theme is delivery. The people of Northern Ireland  pay their taxes in the expectation that their  locally elected representatives will deliver a return on their  investment in the form of visibly improved services. On many occasions in the  past, people here had their taxes raised with promises of new or improved  services. However, too frequently when the time came to see delivery, the  public often failed to see an outcome that lived up to those earlier pledges.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Ministers in this Executive must, and can, do better than  that. The Programme for Government set out what the Executive have committed to  achieve, and the Budget has put in place record levels of investment to support  those targets. The challenge now for every Minister is to ensure delivery  against our collective commitments.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Our two themes of efficiency  and delivery are central to the Budget and the Programme for Government  and, as a result, they are also central to the work of PEDU. In effect, the  Budget and the Programme for Government set out the mission statement for PEDU,  asking it to have a twin focus of examining the scope for greater efficiencies,  while also working with Departments to ensure that the funds allocated by the  Executive deliver the improvements promised. That is no different to the  current remit of my Department. However, by creating a single unit with a clear  and undiluted focus, and by developing a new way of working with Departments,  we can bring about transformational change in the delivery of public services  and a totally new culture built upon a shared and relentless focus on  delivering better-quality services for the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The core approach of PEDU will be collaborative in nature,  working with Departments and, through them, with the wider public sector to get  the best public-service outcomes for our community. The approach will not be  one of hindsight and negative criticism, but of working alongside Departments  and agencies, in real time, to enhance public-service provision.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">That is not to say, however, that the journey will always  be easy. Such an approach requires honest and open acknowledgement of problems,  and no doubt robust discussions about the best way forward, but that will be in the clear context of a shared desire to  improve performance, and not one of protecting established working  practices and fiefdoms.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to detail at an operational level, the work of  PEDU will, by and large, fall into two broad categories: work focusing on  identifying and tackling poor performance and delivery; and reviews focused on  tackling inefficiency and releasing resources. I will give a flavour of what  that will involve.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">11.15 am</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Concerning the unit&rsquo;s work on delivery, there will be a  link into the Programme for Government&rsquo;s monitoring arrangements. Therefore,  for example, if that monitoring system were  to indicate that a particular public service was not on track to meet  the Executive&rsquo;s targets in the Programme for Government, PEDU could investigate  the matter by working with the relevant Department, or Departments. In such a  case, PEDU&rsquo;s approach would involve consideration of quantitative and  qualitative information to detect the source of performance shortcomings. In  collaboration with the relevant Departments, the unit would then seek to  identify actions to address the problem and bring delivery back on track.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Incidentally, it is worth recognising that, in many cases,  as a by-product of improved delivery, efficiency and productivity will also improve. Ultimately, therefore, as funding  is better and more quickly translated into additional and better outputs,  resources will be used more efficiently.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On the other hand, a review that focuses exclusively on  efficiency is likely to have a somewhat different objective. In that case, the  review&rsquo;s intention should be to identify operational efficiencies in processes  and organisations by using data analysis or  by benchmarking with comparable  service providers. Such a review might be employed, for example, in  circumstances in which a merger of organisations failed to yield the  anticipated benefits, or, perhaps, if a spend-to-save initiative had spent the  money but not delivered the savings.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Some people might consider a PEDU review as a threat. Let me be clear; the only  threat will be to inefficiency and poor performance. Those who care about  public services &mdash; and I am sure that all my Executive colleagues are in that  group &mdash; will welcome PEDU&rsquo;s involvement.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">No matter what circumstances lead to PEDU&rsquo;s involvement,  the unit will work in co-operation with those  responsible for service delivery in the Department or agency in  question. That spirit of partnership will be vital in the quest to identify and  overcome barriers to delivering improved public services. In essence the  Executive, the Assembly and the public simply want good-quality, well-run  public services. Ultimately, PEDU will be there to help Departments get  services working in the desired manner, deliver what was promised and, in doing  so, provide taxpayers with value for money.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It would be unwise to expect instant success on delivery  forged as a result of an overnight switch throughout public services to a  performance culture. In reality, such a change will not be plain sailing, and  will demand much effort and persistence. However, in addition to hard work and  dedication, such change will undoubtedly  require Members, as public representatives, to contemplate radical  options to make tough decisions and to take  positive action to deliver public services in the manner promised in the  Programme for Government.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have established a ministerial advisory panel to assist  in our mission of reaching a point at which all Government&rsquo;s tools are focused  on maximising performance and delivering better services. The small group of  individuals on that panel will offer the benefit of their insight and  experience in delivering significant improvements in large organisations,  overseeing organisational change and driving improvements in performance and  efficiency. Authoritative, independent perspectives are always beneficial &mdash;  particularly if problems are persistent, radical change is required and vested  interests are rife.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In respect of the panel&rsquo;s composition, I shall avoid being  dogmatic about the number of members, the panel&rsquo;s duration etc. Undoubtedly, as  we seek to create a new performance culture, the panel will be most beneficial  in the short-to-medium term. Furthermore, I wish to avoid a situation arising  in which I might have to forgo an outstanding individual&rsquo;s services just  because the set number of positions are already filled.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Bearing those points in mind, I have already secured the involvement of Sir Michael Barber, Frank  Cushnahan and Dennis Licence as members of the ministerial advisory  panel. They are outstanding individuals, with significant experience and  credibility in driving step changes in performance in a variety of  organisations at local, national and international levels.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Sir Michael Barber, now  with McKinsey and Company, is a leading expert on public-service  delivery, and is probably best known for establishing and leading Tony Blair&rsquo;s  Prime Minister&rsquo;s delivery unit between 2001 and 2005.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">That unit had much success in getting the Govern&shy;ment  machine in Whitehall  to focus on delivery. Sir Michael will provide his support as part of a small  McKinsey and Co team.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Frank Cushnahan, a corporate banker by profession, is known  to many Members. He is a former chairman of the Belfast Harbour Commissioners,  and he spent eight years overseeing a period of change and strong growth in our  largest seaport. In addition, Frank brings significant  financial and commercial experience, gained in the banking sector.  Moreover, he has led a number of public assignments to restructure a range of  organisations and industries. I have asked Frank to chair the advisory panel.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Dennis Licence is the  chairman of a local accountancy practice. He retired as managing  director of the First Trust Bank in 2005 after a long career in banking, during  which he held several senior positions. Dennis understands consultancy work and  specialises in business restructuring and  development, human resource management and strategic development. He has  served in a range of other positions, including being a fellow of the Chartered  Institute of Marketing, chairman of Business in the Community and president of  the Employers&rsquo; Forum on Disability.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">PEDU is located in the Department of Finance and Personnel  (DFP), and it will be led by Richard Pengelly, one of my senior departmental officials. Thus, it will combine public  finance skills and expertise with significant knowledge of the outputs promised  by Departments when they bid for resources during the recent Budget process. He  will lead a small team of PEDU staff, some of whom are already in place. That  core team will be supplemented by additional staff on short-term assignments,  who bring with them expertise on the particular area under review at the time,  or who have specific skills in areas such as organisational audit and review.  In some cases, that will include front-line professional staff, whose  experiences and insights are particularly valuable, as well as individuals from  beyond the public sector.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The head of the unit will report directly to me and through  me, as Minister of Finance and Personnel, to the Executive. It is right that  PEDU should report to the Executive, because delivery of the Executive&rsquo;s  Programme for Government is at stake. If a key target is in danger of being  missed, the Executive not only need to know about it but they require the tools  to take direct action to deal with the problems and get delivery back on track.  As a result, PEDU will focus particularly on the Executive&rsquo;s priorities and,  where funding is not translating into the desired outcomes, the Executive can  use PEDU as a means to take direct action to identify problems and implement  solutions.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Where will the early focus of PEDU be directed? The unit  will be keen to determine whether the key initiatives set out in the Programme  for Government have robust delivery plans that are designed to convert funding  into results. That should help to establish whether any of our key initiatives  are in need of assistance at this early stage.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We already know that the  economy is the Executive&rsquo;s top priority &mdash; and rightly so &mdash; which often  leads me to ask what actions we could take quickly to facilitate economic  growth. Planning is a key enabler of such growth, and although that often leads  to debates over planning policy, we should not forget that a good-quality  planning process is also beneficial. Long-drawn-out processes can increase  holding costs and uncertainty and, ultimately, only delay compliant projects. The Minister of the Environment and I  believe that we can, and should, improve on performance in that area.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">That is only one area of concern: undoubtedly, there will  be others. In my Department, I am aware of the concerns expressed by the  Committee for Finance and Personnel and other public representatives about the  increase in the level of rates arrears and the uptake of housing benefit,  particularly among owner-occupiers. In response, I could highlight the  challenges faced by the new Land and Property Services agency over the past 18  months in the introduction of the new domestic rating system. However, rather  than review the past, I have required the  agency to put in place a clear recovery plan, designed to ensure  measurable improvements over the next 18 months, and I seek reassurance that  the LPS is getting the support it needs to deliver from other parts of my  Department. Therefore, I have asked PEDU to work with the Land and Property  Services in DFP to ensure that there is an action plan and timetable in place  to deal with those problems.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In other Departments and public bodies we should not expect everything in the Programme for  Government to be delivered with ease. If that were the case, I could  only conclude that we had failed to set the bar high enough at the beginning.  In progressing, some areas will struggle. With PEDU in place, the Executive  should be better placed to identify who is struggling and be better positioned  to do something about it.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">When the Executive&rsquo;s  agreed Budget was announced in January, I paid tribute to the  constructive approach taken by my ministerial colleagues, which had allowed  agreement to be reached on financial allocations to Departments for the next  three years. Agreeing and announcing plans, programmes and budgets was  relatively easy. The Executive now face the challenge of delivering on their  commitments and on their shared ambition to make Northern Ireland a  better place for all citizens. We must not fool ourselves, or attempt to fool  others, that delivering the changes needed to make public services more  efficient and more focused on the needs of our community will be easy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There will be resistance to change and to making change  quickly. I believe firmly that the Executive can deliver on their commitments  in the Programme for Government if they can create and maintain a clear and  urgent focus on delivering on our shared commitments to the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The creation of the performance and efficiency delivery  unit provides a clear signal that this is our priority and our ambition for the  future.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Finance and Personnel (Mr McLaughlin)</strong>: Go raibh maith  agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his statement. The Finance Committee has had periodic updates on  the progress of the proposition, which has been well signalled. The Committee  appreciates the additional information presented by the Minister.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Members will be interested in how PEDU&rsquo;s success will be  measured and the targets that will be set for it. PEDU&rsquo;s accountability and  reporting arrangements will also be of interest &mdash; how will the Assembly&rsquo;s  scrutiny role be factored into those arrangements?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister indicate what protocols have been  established to ensure positive relationships between PEDU and Departments, and  whether those include potential incentives for Departments to co-operate? How  will he ensure that PEDU will not contradict or encroach upon the work of the  Audit Office or DFP supply? Go raibh maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I thank the Chairperson for his questions. The answer to the first question is  difficult in that the only measure of PEDU&rsquo;s success will be the delivery of  the Programme for Government. I envisage that from this moment on, PEDU will  fade into the background in a public sense. Its role is to collaborate with  Departments. It is not there to say &ldquo;PEDU has arrived&rdquo;. PEDU is not the story.  The story will be the delivery of the Programme for Government and the  achievements of various targets set by Ministers.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Success will probably best be determined by Ministers at an  Executive level, because they will have seen  the assistance that has been given behind the scenes.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Regarding the reporting role, I have indicated that PEDU  will report directly to me. It will be based at my departmental headquarters; it will report to the Executive  through me, and because this concerns the delivery of the Executive&rsquo;s Programme  for Government, I expect to be updating the Executive on the work of PEDU on a  fairly regular basis.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee&rsquo;s role will be important. It will have the  opportunity at any stage to raise issues about the work of PEDU, and perhaps  the Committee for the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister  may also be taking an interest as this is about the delivery of the Programme for Government. Committees as a whole  may want to have a role in drawing the attention of PEDU to issues within their  Departments where they think that it can be of assistance.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">11.30 am</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is an incentive for everyone to have better performance,  efficiency and delivery; that is the ultimate goal. We are here to serve the  community, to deliver its aspirations and to deliver on the programme to which  we have committed ourselves. The incentive, therefore, is the delivery of that  programme, and it is hoped that an aspiration to raise their game will be at  the forefront of every Department&rsquo;s mind. It is for that reason that I have  volunteered an area of activity from my Department that I want PEDU to examine.  I believe that PEDU can do a useful task, and, to that end, I will give  colleagues a lead.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I remember that the Member for East Londonderry Mr Dallat  put down a question for oral answer about how the Audit Office might become  more involved in the running of schemes and programmes, and he followed up that  question on several occasions. In response, I said that it was not appropriate,  because the Audit Office&rsquo;s role comprised being able to stand back and look at  outcomes impartially and independently. If the Audit Office were to be involved  at the early stage of a scheme, it would be part of the end problem. PEDU,  however, will be involved throughout the process in real time, as I said in my  statement. That is the distinction between the two roles. The Audit Office role will not be affected, but since PEDU will  intervene in the early stage of a scheme or programme, it is hoped that  there will be less for the Audit Office to be critical about.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement. What budget has been allocated to PEDU?  Has that money been allocated from the DFP budget, or have other Departments  contributed? The Department must ensure that PEDU does not add to the  structures of bureaucracy that exist in a system that is, already,  bureaucratic. Has the Minister set a time limit, after which the effectiveness  of PEDU will be reviewed?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Given that there has been a delay, when does the Minister envisage that PEDU will commence  meaningful work from which the Assembly will see results?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>: PEDU has a budget of approximately &pound;0&middot;5 million, which comes  from DFP&rsquo;s resources. We are not, therefore, seeking additional funding for its  operation; its budget came about as a reallocation within the Department. I  will be pleased if other Departments want to make contributions, but I am sure  that it will be difficult to prise resources from them.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I assure the Member that increasing bureaucracy is the last  thing that PEDU will do. The function of PEDU already exists in my Department;  DFP is not merely taking on some new role  and authority. We have the power to do all those things, but it is  important that we have a more focused and dedicated unit to deal with the  issues. Therefore, I do not believe that we have increased bureaucracy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We are going through the three-year cycle for the Programme for Government, and at the end of that period,  I am sure that the Assembly will want to examine how effective PEDU has been and take decisions at  that stage. That would seem to be an appropriate time in which to see  the unit&rsquo;s worth within the overall structure.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Storey mentioned delays; I do not recognise delays. As I  said previously, the unit has been set up, and it has started work. It is  working with OFMDFM on the monitoring arrangements so that we can fit in  properly to whatever role is there.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have mentioned some of the early areas that we are going  to look at &mdash; planning and the Land and Property Services &mdash; so we are in  business.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  concur with the Minister who, in his statement today, indicated that a spirit  of partnership will be vital for PEDU to  achieve a successful outcome. PEDU has been developed from the Prime  Minister&rsquo;s delivery unit (PMDU), and successful aspects of that unit included  working with delivery bodies to seek to improve efficiency and delivery, rather  than holding Departments and other bodies to account. Given the non-voluntary  aspects of the model that have been outlined by the Minister, how can he be  certain that PEDU and the Departments will work in partnership successfully?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  To some extent the Member is right; PEDU is a development of Tony Blair&rsquo;s PMDU  and, indeed, we have been fortunate to have had the head of Tony Blair&rsquo;s delivery unit, Sir Michael Barbour, involved  in our unit. One of the values of Sir Michael&rsquo;s involvement will be that he  will bring the protocols that operated in the delivery unit in the UK as a whole to our system here in Northern Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">If anyone wants to read more about that issue, Sir Michael  has written a book on his experiences as head of  PMDU, which is worth reading, and I am sure that the Library either has  a copy or will get one very quickly.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Sir Michael Barbour adopted a collaborative partnership  approach; going into the Departments not to expose them or show them up but on  the basis that whatever credit came from better performance by a Department  would remain in that Department.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Again, the story was not about the delivery unit itself,  and there is a need to understand that. In the early stages, I know there will  be &mdash; in fact there already has been &mdash; concern among officials about PEDU coming  into their Departments like storm troopers, causing havoc all around as they  lift every stone to see what is underneath it. That is not the role that PEDU  will have, and the more that PEDU works in the system, the more collaborative  partnerships and working relationships will be created.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that Departments will not see PEDU as something that they should fear, but rather as  something that they will want to work with in their desire to have  better performance, efficiency and delivery.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his substantial statement and I assure him of my full  support for the initiative. I note and support the initial steps and areas of  inquiry, including the planning system and rate arrears that he referred to in  his statement. I encourage Ministers to join in this collaborative effort.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister referred to the role of political representatives, and I take this opportunity to  congratulate him on his election as  leader designate of the Democratic Unionist Party, an important role  within our political system that, among other things, will give him an  opportunity to further the ends referred to in his statement.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As regards the Minister&rsquo;s comments on radical options,  tough decisions, and the role of political representatives therein, does he  agree that there is not enough awareness of opportunity costs in our political  system? There is an assumption that if resources are put to a good end, that is  necessarily a good thing. However, every pound spent in one way forgoes the  opportunity to spend it in another. The task is to spend that pound in the most  efficient and effective manner. Will the Minister comment on whether he thinks  that that would call for a significant change in our political culture?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  First, I thank the Member for his good wishes &mdash; I think. I also thank him for  his support for the work of PEDU. I emphasise that when I chose planning and  the Land and Property Services as areas that PEDU might want to look at, there  was no implication or criticism contained in that choice.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, it is  recognised that they have an important role to play in meeting the  targets that the Executive have set. If we were to ask PEDU to work on various areas, we would not want the people who work in  those areas to think that that is being done because they are doing a  bad job. PEDU will do that work because those people have a major role to play  in ensuring that the targets that the Executive have set are reached.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr O&rsquo;Loan a Member for North Antrim  mentioned tough decisions. Such decisions may have to be made if the targets  that the Executive have set in the Pro&shy;gramme for Government are not being met.  One of those decisions might be that more funds are required, which may mean  that a reallocation of resources around the Executive is necessary to achieve  those targets. We will have to make those types of tough decisions, including  those on the opportunity costs to which the Member referred.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The reality of public-funding allocation is that when money  is allocated to one source of activity, it is denied to another. That is why I  get a little impatient when Departments do not spend the funds that they have  been allocated. That leads to underspend and to people in other areas of  activity being frustrated. Those people ask what they could have done with the  millions of pounds that a Department has not spent. Opportunity  costs are important, and one critical area to consider is whether best value is  being achieved for all the money that is spent in the public sector. That is  the imperative that the business cases that are required for significant  projects must take into consideration.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  also congratulate the Minister on receiving the endorsement of his party  colleagues yesterday. I wish him well in whatever challenges the future may  hold. On behalf of the opposition, I welcome the creation of PEDU. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.] </span>Hopefully, that means that the unit has  unanimous support in the House as being a good and welcome initiative.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Before Easter, my party colleagues and I had a constructive meeting with the Minister on the  Deloitte report on the cost of division and the wider challenges that  are involved with that issue. Recently, the issue was highlighted further by  the BBC &lsquo;Panorama&rsquo; programme, which brought it to the attention of a UK national  audience. How does the Minister envisage that the cost of division will be  addressed through the good offices of PEDU?  Does he envisage any particular challenges  or targets being thrown down to Departments during the 2008-11 Budget  period?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I thank the Member for his kind remarks and for his support for the delivery  unit.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I said that one of the two key roles of PEDU is ensuring  efficiency. If funds are being wasted and squandered because of the cost of  division, PEDU will want to deal with that. It is too early for PEDU to  identify the areas that it will deal with, but it is within the unit&rsquo;s remit to  consider what savings can be made. Efficiency is one of the key areas of  activity for the performance and efficiency delivery unit.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement. I welcome the appointment of what he  referred to as outstanding individuals with a high level of experience and  talent. However, I wonder whether he would been better off hiring Mr Farry, who  clearly feels that he could do the entire job on his own. That would have been  much more cost-effective.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Several Members mentioned the attitudes of other  Departments. Does the Minister have any concerns about the level of  co-operation or resistance that PEDU will receive from other Departments? What  role, if any, does he see for the statutory Departments in contributing to the  process of PEDU?</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">11.45 am</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  Does the Member mean statutory Committees?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  Yes.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  First, I am not going to get in to the North Down thing. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span> We already have Mr Farry&rsquo;s services; he will have a role as a member of the  Finance Committee, and, therefore, we will benefit from his wisdom at no  additional cost.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">If I were a departmental official, I would be reluctant to  resist PEDU&rsquo;s involvement because, to some extent, it would expose me as  someone who was opposed to improved performance, efficiency and delivery. If I  were Minister of a Department where officials were unhappy about PEDU&rsquo;s being  involved, I would be asking what they were trying to hide, and I would be all  the more enthusiastic to get PEDU involved. I do not think that departmental  officials will show that kind of resistance. If officials have to meet targets  for their Ministers, and they feel that there is a major task involved, they  will want the assistance of PEDU &mdash; particularly if they think that they will  need some additional resources. That will be a test, and that will be the  message that we will get back.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Obviously, the Finance Committee will play a key role in  continuing to monitor PEDU&rsquo;s work. However, Committees  will be intimately involved in the operation of their own Departments,  closely examining where their strengths and weaknesses lie. Committees will see  those before many others will. Therefore, if a Committee feels that its Department is underperforming in a particular area, it can call on PEDU for  intervention and support. I, along with my Department and PEDU, will  take that very seriously.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Does the Minister share the concern  that because PEDU&rsquo;s main focus will be on efficiency-savings targets,  Departments will be forced to cut front-line services for the community?  Whenever Departments are told to introduce efficiency savings, services are cut, and that can impact on the  local com&shy;munity. How will the Minister seek to alleviate that?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  As the name implies, the purpose of PEDU is to improve performance and  efficiency and to deliver better services on the ground. Therefore, my focus is  on ensuring that the end consumer gets a better deal and a better service. The  purpose of PEDU is not to reduce services but to get better services for the  community.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">No part of today&rsquo;s presentation has been about reducing  front-line services. In fact, it has been quite the opposite &mdash; we want to  ensure that money is not wasted on bureaucracy but rather that it goes to  improving front-line services for the people who need them most.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  Like others, I welcome the creation of PEDU. I particularly welcome the  securing of Sir Michael Barber&rsquo;s services. I am sure that PEDU will benefit  from his expertise, as he pioneered the Prime Minister&rsquo;s delivery unit. It is  likely that some Ministers may be concerned that PEDU will take over various  functions and, almost, start running Departments. The Minister has admitted  that there is likely to be some resistance in the system. How will PEDU affect,  or not affect, departmental responsibility?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I join my colleague in welcoming the fact that PEDU has secured Sir Michael  Barber&rsquo;s services. He has a high profile and possesses a proven track record,  which gives people confidence and adds credibility  to the unit. However, the other two individuals whom I have asked to be  part of the advisory panel, Frank Cushnahan and Dennis Licence, also come with  considerable reputations. They will bring a great deal of experience to the advisory panel, and that experience will  ultimately benefit the unit.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Assuming the  responsibility for running a Department is the last thing that PEDU will  want to do. Let me be clear: there is to be  no change in departmental authority. Ministers have the same  responsibility for their Departments today that they had yesterday &mdash; PEDU does not interfere with ministerial authority at  all. Rather, it will be an instrument that Ministers can use in order to  improve departmental performance. Ministers, more than anyone else, will look  to PEDU to assist them in the long term,  particularly if improvements are required in their Departments.  Ministerial control is to be as it always has been; neither PEDU nor the  Department of Finance and Personnel has  assumed additional functions. DFP already has the authority to do  everything that it asks PEDU to do.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: I  thank the Minister for dealing with this important  issue. Will he tell the House how the Strategic Investment Board&rsquo;s work,  as well as the unique role that it plays in Departments, will be monitored?  What use will be made of modern management techniques, such as total quality  management or continuous improvement?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  Were OFMFDM to ask PEDU to do so, Strategic Investment Board&rsquo;s (SIB) activities  would be something that it could also consider. No strand of Government has a  fence built around it to indicate that PEDU should stay away. PEDU&rsquo;s role is to  examine the performance and efficiency of any area of Government &mdash; SIB is not  exempt.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Moreover, PEDU will use all available management  techniques. As I said earlier, Richard Pengelly will lead the unit. Anyone who  knows Richard will be aware that he is a most competent official, who has the  added advantage of having been intimately involved at every stage of the Budget  process. He knows what Ministers and officials promised they would deliver when  they sought moneys. Therefore, he is ideally placed to ensure that they deliver  on those promises.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McQuillan</strong>:  I join others in welcoming the Minister&rsquo;s  statement, and I thank him for making it. How will PEDU determine areas of activity for examination?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  Several different mechanisms will probably be employed to determine the  subjects that PEDU will explore, some of which we have discussed already. One  that will be used is OFMDFM&rsquo;s target-tracking mechanism. If one of the  Executive&rsquo;s Programme for Government priorities is not being met, PEDU will be  involved in getting it back on track.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">If a Minister, believing that it will be beneficial,  requests PEDU&rsquo;s assistance, the Department of Finance and Personnel may be able  to identify, using DFP Supply processes, where PEDU involvement might help.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have already spoken about the role that the Committees  could play. However, if problems are identified and if help is sought, PEDU  will be available to give support.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  I also welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. One issue to consider is that old  habits die hard in the Civil Service and in Departments. That is particularly  the case in the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety where,  as I am sure the Minister knows, several efficiency savings regarding Health  Service staff must be made.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a mentality of empire building in the way in which  Departments are managed. What can PEDU do to help break that mindset &mdash; if that  terminology is appropriate &mdash; to allow for appropriate staffing in the Health  Service and to ensure that it is staffed by front-line professionals rather  than by management?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I am truly glad that I have the support of the Member on this issue. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.] </span>Through the creation of PEDU, we are attempting  to create a new culture of performance and delivery in public services.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Speaking from my own experience in local government, so  that I do not appear to be pointing the finger  at any Department, I know that local government was seen simply as a  service whereby money was given to every job in order to ensure that it got  done. There were no real criteria to measure whether the public was getting  best value for money. Only more recently has the concept of value for money  come to the fore in the delivery of local government services.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We are the custodians of the public purse. It is not our  money that is being spent; we are spending hard-earned taxes and rates. We,  therefore, have a massive responsibility to ensure that when we are spending  that money, we are spending it wisely. We must also ensure that we are getting  the best value for that money and that when people give us their money, we  deliver the services that they expect. Given that people have invested in our  public services, we must ensure that we deliver the best services for that.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">PEDU will attempt to change the culture in Depart&shy;ments so  that they perform better and so that we have an efficient, timely delivery of  public services.</p>

		    <p class="H5StageHeading" style="margin-top:11.35pt;">Cancelled Clinics</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName" style="margin-top:2.85pt;"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to  one hour and 30 minutes for this debate. The proposer of the motion will have  10 minutes to propose and 10 minutes to make a winding-up speech. All other  Members who are called to speak will have five minutes. One amendment has been  selected and published on the Marshalled List. The proposer of the amendment  will have 10 minutes to propose and five  minutes to make a winding-up speech.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName" style="margin-top:4.55pt;"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>: I beg to move</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion" style="margin-top:4.55pt;">That this Assembly calls on the  Minister of Health, Social Service and Public Safety to introduce measures to  reduce the cancellation level of outpatient clinics.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText" style="margin-top:4.25pt;">It  should be clear by now to all of us who are charged with political  responsibility in Northern    Ireland that we face difficult times. The  looming financial crisis will require us to be effective and industrious in the  way in which we do our business in future. The failure of the Prime Minister,  Mr Brown, to address the wrongs of the past through his delivery of an  inadequate package to finance infrastructural support will create problems for  the delivery of central services to the public.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText" style="margin-top:4.25pt;">The havoc that was wreaked on our  community by terrorists and terrorism  during the past 40 years resulted &mdash; to the detriment of our physical  infra&shy;structure &mdash; in a large  proportion of available finances being spent on security. Money that should  have been spent on hospitals,  schools and the physical infrastructure was siphoned away to pay for the  security bill. We are now left to pick up  the pieces, and we are required to respond to many public demands while  being burdened with a significant infrastructural deficit and finite resources.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText" style="margin-top:4.25pt;">It is, therefore, incumbent on  all Members to ensure that every penny is  spent wisely. We must look at every budget and item of expenditure to  ensure that we are getting value for money without a penny having been wasted. The budget for the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety is a significant pro&shy;portion of the total  Northern Ireland Budget, and we need to be sure that there will be no  waste or inefficiencies. In an attempt to make the best use of our available  resources, we also need to ensure that no area of expenditure is being left  unvisited.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText" style="margin-top:4.25pt;">In that context, Members will know  that the level of cancelled clinics requires urgent and radical appraisal.  Across the trusts in 2003-04, there were 13,065 cancelled clinics; in 2004-05,  there were 13,995; in 2005-06, 14,771; and almost 14,000 in 2006-07. The  did-not-attend rate for patients in Northern Ireland in 2006-07 was  11&middot;4%. In England  the rate for the same period was 10&middot;8%.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">12.00 noon</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I draw the attention of Members to the amount of money that  is spent on using independent-sector providers to reduce outpatient waiting  times. In 2005-06, the figure was over &pound;400,000, which jumped to over &pound;6  million in 2006-07. In 2006-07, 43,319 people were seen by the independent  sector, and a further 22,417 people were seen in the 2007-08 period. Those  people should, and would, have been seen in the Health Service if it were not  for the level of cancelled outpatient clinics.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Independent-sector providers were used to achieve a welcome  and substantial reduction in waiting times, and the Minister and his Department  should be congratulated for that &mdash; there is nothing worse than waiting for  treatment in the knowledge that a date for an appointment cannot be found in  the near future. However, such use of the private sector is similar to robbing  Peter to pay Paul or applying a sticking plaster when surgery is required. Subsidising the private sector in that  way is an admission that an important aspect of our clinical arrangements  requires an immediate and comprehensive overhaul. The crisis in the outpatient  waiting times would not have arisen if the problem of cancelled clinics had  been properly addressed. The money that is spent on reducing waiting lists  through the outsourcing of work to the private sector could be more effectively  employed in other areas.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In each of the past four years, approximately 48,000 new referrals did not attend their outpatient  appointments as scheduled. A new referral is the first &mdash; in some cases  the only &mdash; attendance at a consultant&rsquo;s outpatient clinic in a hospital. In the  same four years, approximately three times that number of consultant-initiated  appointments were missed by patients who did not give any notice to the  hospital. On average, there were 200,000 appointments each year in which the  patient did not turn up, and the real figure could be as high as 390,000. A 4%  reduction over a four-year period cannot be considered encouraging.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">All of that represents an enormous failure in the system  and is totally unacceptable. The potential efficiency savings are considerable,  and expensive temporary solutions will disguise the problem without dealing  with the root cause. There is also the cost in human terms for nursing and  medical-records staff when people fail to turn up without warning, the  consequent increase in waiting lists when operations or procedures are  postponed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There are some obvious changes that consultants and other  medical staff could make. They should be required to find cover if they go on  leave, and no leave should be granted if cover is not found. Clinics should be  able to proceed in the absence of a consultant if a senior registrar or another  consultant is present to cover. More efficient management of time is required,  with flexibility built into the system, perhaps through more evening and  weekend clinics that afford more choice for patients. That happens already, but  more flexibility is required. Medical professionals should be discouraged from  taking study leave during clinical time, and it should happen only when  consultants have no outpatient clinics. Consultants have an important role to  play, and they must be forced to deliver.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Ultimately, however, responsibility must be placed on those who abuse the system, and we should  consider the penalties that can be applied to discourage irresponsible  behaviour by those seeking treatment. Sanctions on those who fail to attend a  second appointment could be applied &mdash; two strikes and they are out. In any  event, a root-and-branch review of every aspect of the appointment system is  required until the problem is brought under control. I call on the Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety to introduce measures that reduce the  level of cancellations in outpatient-clinic appointments, which would create  efficiency savings with no reliance on the private sector.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  I beg to move the following amendment: At end insert</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;; and further calls for a holistic, patient-centred approach  from the Minister and his department to tackle waiting lists.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I  thank the Members who brought the motion to the House for debate. The Assembly,  the Health Committee, the Minister and his Department must get involved in this  important issue in order to tackle waiting lists and the level of cancelled  clinics.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Waiting lists are a concern for everyone in one way or  another. As community activists, elected repre&shy;sentatives and family members,  we can all highlight cases of cancelled clinics or long waiting times for  appointments.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Whether clinics are cancelled or patients fail to show up,  waiting lists are, and will continue to be, a problem for the Health Service.  More importantly, unless we get serious and try to sort out the situation, they  will continue to cost millions of pounds a year. Some figures have been  mentioned, and I do not propose to go over them again. I want to thank the Minister  for attending the debate. I hope that he tells Members, in simple terms, how he  and the Department propose to tackle the issue of cancelled clinics.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In fairness &mdash; and I know that Alex Easton has mentioned it  &mdash; we know that the Minister is doing some positive work. However, I suspect  that he has many more pressing Health Service issues to deal with than  identifying and using money and resources wasted because of cancelled clinics  or non-attending patients. I accept that there are a number of reasons for this,  which I will come back to later.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have looked at some of the information relating to cancelled clinics and read the excellent report  published by the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), which highlighted a  number of reasons for cancellation. However, while we support the motion&rsquo;s call  for the Minister to introduce measures to reduce the number of cancelled  clinics, we felt that a patient-centred approach was needed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The PAC report states that in 2005-06, &pound;259 million was  spent on outpatient services in the North. The PAC blames inefficiencies on  non-attendance and the trusts&rsquo; cancellation of clinics, both of which waste  resources and lead to increased waiting times for other patients. That is why I  propose the amendment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A holistic, patient-centred approach to the issue is key. Scotland&rsquo;s new  approach to its waiting lists and non-attendance is a patient-focused system of  booking appointments that puts users at the heart of a dialogue process. At the  outset, patients are sent a letter acknowledging their referral. As the patient  nears the top of the waiting list they receive a further letter, inviting them  to telephone to arrange an appointment. The process is complemented by a policy  preventing the clinic from being cancelled with less than six weeks&rsquo; notice.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The patient is then offered a choice of dates and times  from which they choose the most convenient. Failure to telephone leads to a  further letter being sent to the patient and their GP, explaining that they  have been removed from the list.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Patient-focused booking  enables the patient to choose an appointment that is more suited to  their lifestyle. Information shows that patients are, therefore, much more  likely to attend and that less administrative staff time is spent on cancelling or rearranging appointments. A survey  of 700 people on this approach found that 98% of patients were happy to  telephone and arrange their appointments, while 97% were happy with the  appointment that they received. Those figures show that there is an onus on  patients to be centrally involved in the process.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The PAC reported that there was a problem with the  perception that private-practice commitments of consultants may have some  impact on whether clinics actually take place. The PAC stated that, while there  is no doubt that the majority of consultants operate to the highest professional standards, it must also be  recognised that there can be a potential conflict between the private  and NHS elements of consultants&rsquo; work.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister should comment on that, and on the PAC report  in general. I support the motion but also propose the amendment.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mrs I Robinson)</strong>:  I wish to emphasise how important it is that of all the people of Northern  Ireland work in close co-operation with their elected representatives to build  a better future for us all. The process of creating a peaceful, democratic  society is still in its infancy. There is much work to be done in the years ahead to build relationships that  were severely damaged by the past four decades of community strife and  terrorism. We must also rebuild our economy and infrastructure to meet the  challenges of living in the global economy of the twenty-first century.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Our future will depend entirely on our ability and  determination to make our devolved Government work and to drive our economy  forward. Success in making the necessary improvements in education, the environ&shy;ment,  regional development and health will depend on how successfully we can develop  every aspect of the economy. Those improvements will include reviewing every  aspect of the Health Service to ensure that there is no waste, that  inefficiencies are reduced, and that every penny spent is spent wisely and  accountably.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We owe an enormous debt to those who work at all levels in  our hospitals and clinics. Every day, we see the dedication of medical staff,  who can be assured of our gratitude. However, it is devastating for health  professionals and those in the community who are urgently seeking an  appointment to learn that, in 11&middot;4% of cases, people fail to turn up for a  scheduled exam&shy;ination, procedure or operation, without indicating their  intention in advance. That is a clear and unacceptable abuse of the appointment  system. That is demoralising for medical staff and represents a hugely  expensive waste of resources, time and money. Such abuse also has the potential  to lead to unnecessary suffering for other patients who are awaiting treatment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In the past four years, approximately 50,000 new referrals  failed to turn up as scheduled. Approximately 1,500 consultant-initiated  appointments were cancelled because patients failed to attend and gave no  warning or notification to the hospital. Some people are quick to criticise  health workers and politicians, but this is a clear example of an issue on  which we can all pull together to put things right.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The culture of tolerance of those who behave  inappropriately must change. We must review the process of cancelled  appointments and consider what steps can be  taken to reduce the number of cancellations. However, ultimately, people  must be held responsible for their failure to provide adequate notice that they  are unable to attend a scheduled appointment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Cancelled appointments lead directly to lengthening waiting  lists. Perhaps it is time for the Health Service to consider imposing a charge  on people who fail to turn up for an appointment without giving notice. Some  mechanism must be put in place to ensure that expanding waiting lists do not  contribute to longer-term health problems for patients who are careful in  keeping their appointments, particularly in the mental-health sector, where  cancelled appointments seem to be most prevalent.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I call on the Minister and his officials to urgently  address that issue, because many millions of pounds are being wasted. We need  an immediate response from the Minister. I support the motion and the  amendment.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I welcome the debate, which I hope will go some way towards tackling the  problem. The Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety states  that around 345,000 clinics are held each year, with almost 2&middot;7 million  attendances. Those are sizeable numbers.  Departmental figures show that, over the course of a typical year,  around 300,000 outpatients are not seen. Those figures represent a combination  of patients who had their appointments  cancelled by trusts, who cancelled their own appointments &mdash; which were  not subsequently filled &mdash; or who failed to attend their appointments. It is a  matter of great concern that people with mental-health issues are the most  likely to fail to attend appointments, and specific improvements must be made  in that area.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Those overall figures make up 10&middot;2% of the total number of  outpatients. Although I appreciate that, due to recording anomalies, there are  often discrepancies between recorded statistics and actual attendances, the  figures are still significant. Cancellations have con&shy;sequences. First, those  that have not been seen either will not receive their treatment, or will have  to wait to do so, and that can have clinical  and health implications. Secondly, the potential cost to the Department  of Health &mdash; and, ultimately, the taxpayer &mdash; of non-attendances and  cancellations is estimated at &pound;11&middot;6 million annually. In a period of fiscal  tightness, that is a substantial amount of money that could be used for  front-line services.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I understand that the Minister has inherited a difficult  situation. For a long time, Northern Ireland  has lagged behind its regional counterparts in the rest of the United Kingdom.  However, I appreciate that the Department has introduced measures to tackle the  problem, and a major programme of service reform to improve outpatient waiting  times has seen substantial success. A significant component of that is the  intro&shy;duction of partial booking of outpatient appointments, whereby, shortly  after their referral, patients are advised of the probable wait for an  appointment. Six weeks before the end of that wait, they are asked to contact  the hospital to agree a convenient date. Such an approach has been successful  in Wales, and I hope it will  bring further reductions in cancellations and non-attendance in Northern Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Given that a reduction of 1% in non-attendance or  cancellations could save up to &pound;1million, the need for further success becomes  apparent. The Minister has had success in reducing outpatient waiting times:  today no one will wait more than six months for a first outpatient appointment.  I appreciate, however, that more can be done.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Although the Ulster Unionist Party will support the Sinn  F&eacute;in amendment, I was initially worried that it would take some of the focus  from the issue of cancelled clinics. However, party members are happy to accept  both the motion and the amendment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I understand that achieving goals in non-attendance and  cancellations will take time; however, policies that tackle both the  cancellations by trusts and the non-attendance of patients are required.  Patients must be made aware that they have responsibilities to hospitals,  health professionals, other patients, and &mdash; above all &mdash; to themselves. An  environment of respect must be fostered  between patients and the Health Service, so that the best care can be  provided for those most in need.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We are taking meaningful steps. Cancellations and non-attendance figures are heading in the right  direction, but more can be done, and I am confident that more will be  done.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I shall listen with interest to what the Minister has to  say, and I welcome any update that he can give regarding the current situation  and any actions that he is taking. I support the motion and the amendment.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>: I  support the motion and the amend&shy;ment and thank those Members who tabled them.  Unfortunately, the consequences of missed appoint&shy;ments, which are a common  occurrence in outpatient clinics, are not particularly well known. They include  the cost to the Health Service, and to other patients, who are bumped back each  time. When I examined the Comptroller and Auditor General for Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  report on missed appointments, several points became apparent. Patients  sometimes cancel appointments at the last minute, and some just do not show up.  Others persistently do not show up, and sometimes the trusts cancel  appointments. Patients who miss appointments tend to cite such factors as  forgetfulness as the main reason.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">They must bear their share of the responsibility; it really  must be brought home to patients that missed appointments have monetary  consequences for the Health Service. It must be explained to patients that they  must cancel their appointments if they decide not to attend because they are  feeling better. They must appreciate the importance of doing so.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The auditors also pointed out that it is time to improve on  current arrangements and to create a more comprehensive service that meets  users&rsquo; expectations of the appointments process as regards booking, changing  and cancelling appointments, and more flexible opening hours. When walking down  the Lisburn Road  and the Malone Road,  I have observed that the private clinics are open at all hours, including  weekends and evenings. We could consider changing the opening times of clinics  to suit people&rsquo;s lifestyles.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Some patients are concerned that private-practice  obligations may impact on the times at which clinics are held. The merging of  private healthcare with the National Health Service always raises anxieties,  and those anxieties cannot be dismissed. Some consultants spend a large  proportion of their time in private practice, and it is valid to argue that  that may have a detrimental effect on the National Health Service. We know that  consultants also cancel clinics, sometimes at very short notice. Patients must  be told in advance whether they will be able to see their consultant. Some  patients may be particularly worried about a health concern and turn up  religiously for appointments, yet never get to see their own consultant.  Patients often do not get to see the named consultant.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">If we are to restore confidence in the National Health  Service, we must reduce waiting times to an acceptable level. People should not  have to scrimp and save for private treatment because they are worried about a  condition or are in pain. Although the targets have led to improved waiting  times, I still believe that the waiting times are not acceptable &mdash; if somebody  is worried or in pain, they might still have to wait up to six months for an  appointment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Although it is possible that improved technology could  result in better booking systems, it is unlikely that one solution will work  right across the National Health Service. Although the non-attendance rates are  higher in some areas than in others, we need a more patient-centred approach,  as Sue Ramsey said. Many patients fail to attend their appointments without  phoning ahead to cancel them. As I said, it is vital that patients take  responsibility for their appointments. As someone who has attended outpatient  clinics, I know that it is not always clear whether one will be given a new  appointment. Sometimes the process is hit or miss. A patient could have a  serious illness, but unless they remember to stop at the reception desk to ask  for a follow-up appointment, they will not get one.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We know that people sometimes have good reasons for not  taking up their appointments, and that the Department has set targets and met  them. Although that is welcome news, we must further reduce the number of  missed appointments. The majority of people are responsible and notify clinics,  but there are particular issues in relation to attendance at mental-health  clinics, and there is a special onus on personnel to ensure that the patients  are well aware that they are expected to attend appointments.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I look forward to hearing the Minister&rsquo;s proposals for  reducing the cancellation level of all outpatient appointments.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I support this important motion and thank the Members who tabled it for  bringing it to the House.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Health Service should be our number one priority at all  times. As the Alliance Party&rsquo;s health spokesman, I acknowledge the high  standard of work that is carried out by so many people right across the Health  Service: consultants, surgeons, doctors, nurses, cleaners, the Ambulance  Service and every single person who is involved in the delivery of a  first-class Health Service to all our population.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, there are times when, for whatever reason,  the Health Service does not deliver in the way in which we want it to. In those  cases, lessons are learned and improvements made, and so we all strive for  better results. The motion raises real concerns for both health administrators  and patients. Regardless of who cancels the appointments, the end result is a  drain on scarce resources. That is the problem that we are trying to overcome.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Information to which I am privy states that some 13,500  clinics were cancelled in 2006 at a cost to the Health Service of &pound;11&middot;5 million  &mdash; a staggering figure, and one that must be reduced. Many reasons exist for  clinics being cancelled, but it is in everyone&rsquo;s interest to ensure that some  form of procedure be put in place sharply in order to reduce that anomaly. It  is not only in patients&rsquo; best interests but health officials&rsquo; that that happen.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the fact that the Minister of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety is present. I have no doubt that he will take on  board the genuine concerns that have been expressed and make every effort to  get on top of this serious problem.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Genuine reasons exist for many cancellations. However,  pressure must be applied, encouragement must be given or whatever is required  must be done to ensure that patients understand the importance of attending  appointments. Surely common courtesy tells patients that, if they cannot attend  appointments, they should at least telephone the hospital or clinic as early as  possible to advise of their non-attendance and to give their reasons. If that  were to be done, and done early, new appointments could be issued and another  patient seen without wasting the precious time of consultants and others.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As Sue Ramsey mentioned, patient-focused booking has been  introduced in Scotland  to some good effect. If patient-focused booking is considered a success in Scotland, Northern Ireland may be able to  repeat that success. Anything that greatly reduces the number of cancelled clinics  and saves Health Service costs is to be  welcomed. I support the motion and the amendment.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I support the motion. I also support amendment, which enhances the motion. Most  people dislike nothing more than the thought of having to go into hospital,  having to share a ward, and being able to see  their family and eat only at certain times. That being the case, many  patients, in an attempt to get home, will play  down how ill they feel. For those patients, outpatient care is  essential. It is of the utmost importance that aftercare be properly  administered and that checks on progress be made in order to ensure a patient&rsquo;s  health and safety. For those reasons, the outpatient clinic is a vital part of  the healthcare system. Any problems that arise there directly affect  constituents&rsquo; health.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The NHS has some of the most intelligent and progressive  doctors in the world, and our patient care should be second to none. As it  stands, however, patients are waiting too long for care, because of  inefficiencies in the system. No one factor is entirely to blame. The  cancellation of clinics can be caused by numerous factors, such as staff  illness, and unavoidable problems may arise that result in an outpatient  clinic&rsquo;s not being held. However, cancel&shy;lations that are down to, for example,  staff holidays cannot be accepted, and changes must be made to ensure that that  does not happen. People are entitled to their holidays, and no one is  suggesting otherwise. However, holiday leave  should be noted down in advance so that administrators then can get  adequate cover in place to ensure that  patients do not lose out on healthcare.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">One reason why one in 10 people is not seen at an  outpatient clinic as soon as they should be seen is because patients themselves  sometimes forget about an appointment or cannot get time off work to attend it.  The Minister&rsquo;s strategy must include a publicity campaign to ensure that people  are made aware that missing an appointment could be detrimental to their  health. Such a campaign would also make people aware that others who could have  made use of that appointment are missing out, too.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I shall give one example from the doctor&rsquo;s clinic in  Kirkcubbin &mdash; not that I attend the doctor, because I am very fortunate in not  having to. However, just after Christmas, I was at the clinic and saw a sign on  the wall that highlighted the number of  missed appointments. That sign focused the minds of those sitting there  that appointments are important and not to be overlooked. Therefore, innovative  ways exist to draw people&rsquo;s attention to the issue of cancelled outpatient  appointments. The public must be made aware that they have to play their role.  However, with respect, the onus is on the Minister to clarify and improve the  current situation.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I fear that, sometimes, we examine figures and statistics  and forget that it is not simply a matter of crunching numbers and ticking  boxes, but of having the right number of clinics and staff. Those clinics are  instrumental in saving lives. Staff can spot the early signs that illness is  returning or worsening, and can ensure that treatment is dispensed. Although a  two-week cancellation may not seem much of a setback in some people&rsquo;s diaries,  for others it can mean the difference between life and death, such as when a  developing heart problem is discovered early and treated.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to make it clear that my remarks are not an attack  on staff in any way, shape or form. They are the people who are most aware of  patients&rsquo; needs. I simply wish to remind the Minister that he cannot allow the  system to fail staff and patients. Therefore, I join my colleagues in urging  the Minister to ensure that problems that are evident in the system are  rectified urgently.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I read the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report  &lsquo;Outpatients: Missed Appointments and Cancelled Clinics&rsquo; and discovered that  there has been some improvement among  trusts, which must be commended for  their work and efforts. The problem is that, although the number of  cancelled clinics throughout the entire Province dropped from around 14,700 to  13,800 &mdash; a drop of approximately 900 &mdash; during 2006-07, it is clear that more  must be done. That could be achieved through a co-ordinated effort by the  Minister and his Department.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I urge the Assembly to join me in calling on the Minister  to deal with this issue through a proactive strategy that begins at the top  level, works its way down, and takes into account not only the successes that  have occurred in Northern    Ireland, but the systems that are in place  on the mainland. Rather than see a total of 924 cancelled clinics by April  2009, the Minister must aim to reduce the  number of cancellations to 5%, which is a more acceptable level. We ask  the Minister to take action immediately in order to make a difference to  patients who are waiting for appointments and who will benefit from a more  efficient system. I support the motion and the amendment.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has arranged to meet immediately upon the  lunchtime suspension of the sitting. I propose, therefore, by leave of the  Assembly, to suspend the sitting until 2.00 pm, when the next Member to speak  will be Dominic Bradley.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The sitting was suspended at 12.32 pm.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">On resuming (Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Molloy] in the  Chair) &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Some worrying changes are  taking place at my local hospital in Newry. Staff at Daisy  Hill Hospital  who arrange appointments for ear, nose and  throat (ENT), antenatal, surgical, and other outpatient clinics have  been told that &mdash; under the review of public administration (RPA) &mdash; their work  will be centralised to a call centre at Craigavon Area   Hospital.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Many people believe  that that move has the potential to impact adversely on the care of  patients as, under those proposals, GP referral letters would initially go to Craigavon Area  Hospital before being returned to Daisy Hill   Hospital. There is no  guarantee that those letters would arrive back in Daisy Hill Hospital in time for consultant clinics  and, indeed, that has been the experience in other areas.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Consultants, therefore, could end up being faced with  patients for whom they have no GP referral notes. Such a situation would play  havoc with outpatient appointments, and could lead to urgent treatment being  delayed. Ironically, therefore, the system itself could produce missed  appointments. The intention behind RPA is to give patients better care and  better services. I doubt whether this change will guarantee that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The relevant professionals are also worried about the  potential impact of the change. Consultants at Daisy Hill Hospital were not made aware of the  changes, and they have written to the Southern Health and Social Care Trust to  communicate their anxiety. The staff at the hospital also had little warning.  The proposal was sprung on them on 20 March, with only two weeks of  consultation time, including the Easter holiday period. Such undue haste does  not allow sufficient time for the effects of the change to be properly  assessed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, medical staff &mdash; consultants and GPs &mdash; are far  from convinced that the proposals are for the benefit  of patients. Trade unions at the hospitals involved have told me that  they were not consulted about the changes  and that equality impact studies of the proposals have not been carried  out.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The further a service is moved away from the local area the  less personal it becomes. The excellent local knowledge built up by staff over  many years will not be used to its best effect in a call centre at some  distance from the residence of the patients. I am very concerned about the  impact that the changes will have on patients&rsquo; health and care and on the  smooth running of outpatient clinics and appointments.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am glad that the  Minister is here today. I ask him to investigate  the situation and to examine the ramifications of the changes, especially considering the deep reser&shy;vations expressed  by the consultants and GPs involved. I welcome a response from the Minister on  that issue in due course. A LeasCheann Comhairle, sin deireadh a bhfuil le r&aacute;  agam. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  I welcome and support the motion proposed by my colleague Mr Easton. In doing  so, I hope to help achieve what every politician wants &mdash; to save the Health Service money that is currently  wasted, so that it can further develop the programmes that benefit all  in society.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It was shocking to read in the Public Accounts Committee  report that &pound;12 million of an already stretched health budget is wasted each  year due to the cancellation of clinics, or non-attendance of patients.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">All Members would agree that that money could be put to  much more beneficial use. To achieve systematic change, we must examine the way  in which hospitals cancel clinics and why  patients fail to attend appointments. Although I accept that the exact  reasons behind patient non-attendance might be difficult to establish, I ask  the Minister to consider using modern communication methods, such as emailing  or text-messaging patients &mdash; only with their written permission &mdash; in an effort  to ensure that the number of missed appointments is reduced.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As for hospital-cancelled clinics, I appreciate that staff  sickness or bereavement cannot be easily taken into account when making plans,  but annual leave can be programmed in effectively. I urge the Minister to  ensure that procedures are in place to deal with that issue effectively.  Although it may inconvenience staff, I am sure that they will appreciate that  it is frustrating for patients to have appointments cancelled by the hospitals,  sometimes at very short notice. It should also  be remembered that many patients work and might have to arrange leave in  order to attend appointments. Despite those and other problems, improvement can  be achieved in that area. The question is how we should go about it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The model adopted by NHS Scotland appears to be a valuable  example of the way in which improvement can be achieved. Patient-focused  booking has reduced the number of hospital-cancelled clinics or missed  appointments by about 2%. If the Health Service in Northern Ireland were to reduce its  figures to that level, it would save approximately &pound;10 million. It is worth  remembering that the patient is at the centre of the process and should be the  priority consideration in developing any new appointments system.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that the Minister could find good use for the money  saved, such as keeping acceptable levels of out-of-hours services in Limavady,  in my constituency. However, achieving change will require commitment from  National Health Service staff and patients and, no doubt, foresight on the part of the Minister. I encourage him to  have the foresight to implement workable, adaptable changes that will benefit  patients, Health Service staff and the Department&rsquo;s budget.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, I take this opportunity to commend all the  healthcare workers, who do a magnificent job. I support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: I welcome the opportunity to discuss the  steps that my Department is taking to reduce the cancellation of outpatient  clinics and the number of missed appointments, ensuring that patients have  timely access to high-quality, safe services. That is a priority that we all  share.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As recently as two years ago, 110,000 people in Northern  Ireland waited more than 13 weeks for a first outpatient appointment &mdash; some people  waited for up to 10 years. Today, apart from a handful of patients, no one  waits for more than 13 weeks. I am committed to reducing that waiting time  further, to nine weeks, by next March. Similar progress has been made in  relation to the time patients wait for a diagnostic test, such as a  computerised tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, and for  inpatient or day-case treatment. Today, no patient waits more than 13 weeks for  a diagnostic test, and only about fifty patients have waited more than 21 weeks  for treatment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, I will seek  further significant reductions in waiting times in those areas, over the  next year, to nine weeks for diagnostic tests and 13 weeks for treatment. To  illustrate that point, the current waiting-time targets are 13 weeks for  initial appointments, 13 weeks for diagnostics and 21 weeks for treatment &mdash; 47  weeks in total.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I plan to set the target for the end of this year to reduce  waiting times from 47 weeks to 31 weeks in total. That will allow up to nine  weeks for initial appointments, nine weeks for diagnostic tests and 13 weeks  for treatment. That bears significant comparison with previous figures. For  example, in March 2005, the target was 18 months for treatment, and that was  routinely missed. In March 2006, the treatment target was one year, and that  was often missed. We can demonstrate significant improvement in performance as far  as treating patients is concerned.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I assure Members that I am by no means complacent about our  current position.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A transformation in waiting-time performance was achieved  through the introduction of a comprehensive reform programme, the key elements  of which ensure that patients of the same clinical priority are attended to in  strict chronological order. Consultants must determine the clinical priority of  patients, and urgent patients will always be seen as a matter of priority.  Patients who have been assessed as a routine clinical priority will be seen in  a fair and clinically appropriate manner, with the earliest appointee being  attended to first. The Department asked specialist consultants to pool their  lists to ascertain how waiting times could be equalised.  In the past, some specialist hospital consultants may have had lengthy  waiting times, while others &mdash; perhaps the more recently appointed &mdash; had shorter  waiting times. By equalising those times and  by pooling lists, we have ensured the even distribution of patients  across all consultants. That has had a major impact in reducing waiting times.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Sue Ramsey, George Robinson and other Members mentioned the  patient-friendly booking system that has been  introduced, and there are new booking arrangements whereby patients can  choose the date and time of their appointment. That provides a better-quality  service to patients and recognises that people lead busy lives and need to be  able to choose a time that suits them. It also reduces the number of patients  who fail to attend outpatient appointments.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department reviewed  outpatient clinic schedules, and trusts are required to ensure that  sufficient time is set aside for new patient referrals. In addition, we have  introduced ICATS, which is a range of new integrated clinical assessment and  treatment services. ICATS is a term that is used for a range of services that  will be provided by integrated multi-disciplinary teams of Health Service  professionals in a variety of primary- and secondary-care settings. It includes  assessment, treatment, diagnostic and advisory services. Under traditional  outpatient arrangements, GPs have no alternative other than to refer to  hospital consultants those patients who they are unable to manage in the  primary-care sector. That led to a significant number of patients who are  waiting to see a hospital consultant.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In such cases where the patient does not see the  consultant, that consultant will often be able to do little for the patient as  surgery is not required. Indeed, not all patients require a consultant&rsquo;s level  of expertise. ICATS ensures that patients are referred to the most appropriate  next step of the care pathway as quickly as possible and that those patients  who need to see a hospital consultant will do so after the completion of all  necessary diagnostic tests. If a primary-case referral is assessed as not being  clinically urgent, it will be directed by ICATS to the next appropriate step.  Again, that reduces the patient&rsquo;s journey time.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are five possible next steps. First, a referral to  diagnostics &mdash; including the various modalities of imaging &mdash; all forms of  scoping, as well as pathology and other physiological measurement services may  be considered. Secondly, a patient may be referred for direct treatment to an  inpatient or day-case schedule. Certain indications imply that direct  treatment, rather than further specialist opinion, is necessary. Thirdly, a  patient may return to primary care for discharge with advice or a request for  further information. Fourthly, a patient may be referred to tier 2 outpatient  services, which is the name that is given to the new clinical services that  should typically form the core of the ICATS. Those services will take referrals  that are not initially indicated for consultant-led clinics and will carry out  face-to-face assessments and examinations and commence treatment where  appropriate. Finally, some patients may be referred to a hospital outpatients  clinic, because even with the introduction of those new services, there will be  a significant remaining stream of  non-urgent patients for whom a traditional outpatient appointment will  be the appropriate next step &mdash; in other words, they will need to see a  consultant.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The ICATS model offers considerable benefits to patients by  ensuring that they are seen by the most appropriate healthcare professionals as  quickly as possible and that limited consultant resources are reserved for  those patients who have been assessed as requiring that level of expertise. New  ICATS services have already been introduced for orthopaedic referrals across Northern Ireland,  and they are now being introduced in urology and ophthalmology.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are also plans to introduce ICATS for ear, nose and  throat; dermatology; and cardiology. In relevant specialties, ICATS are expected to resolve at least 50% of all  referrals from GPs, without the patient having to see a hospital  consultant. In 2008-09, it is expected that ICATS will manage some 30,000  orthopaedic referrals, which will significantly reduce the pressures on  hospital services.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As many Members pointed out, the cost of cancelled clinics is significant. The Northern Ireland  Audit Office estimates the cost to  the taxpayer of cancelled clinics and missed appointments at &pound;11&middot;6  million. That significant sum could be used to benefit patients by allowing  them to be assessed and treated more quickly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, it will never  be possible to eliminate waste totally.  A small number of clinics will always be cancelled because of  unavoidable circumstances, and, similarly, some patients will fail to attend  appointments.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  Mention was made of the possible introduction of financial penalties &mdash; similar  to those imposed by dentists &mdash; on patients who fail to turn up for their  appointments. Although I do not agree with the idea, will the Minister consider  any such penalties to encourage patients to turn up or give clinics early  warning when they cannot attend?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  Financial penalties could be administered only at a disproportionate cost, and,  in any case, I do not want to go down that road.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The cancellation of  clinics at short notice is wasteful, and it is disruptive to patients.  Typically, a clinic lasts for half a day,  and, depending on the specialty, involves up to 20 patients a session.  Therefore, when a hospital cancels a clinic, a considerable number of patients  who may be anxious, or in pain, are affected, and they must wait for another  appointment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Outpatient clinics must, therefore, be cancelled only in  exceptional circumstances. In Northern    Ireland, a relatively  low proportion of outpatient clinics is cancelled, and that must be  viewed in the context of the large number of patients who are seen each year.  In hospitals and other healthcare settings,  over 1&middot;5 million outpatients are seen. The vast majority of them are  seen quickly and experience no difficulty with cancellations.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A detailed census was undertaken after discussions with the  Northern Ireland Audit Office. It found that, in September 2006, only one in 35  consultant-led clinics was cancelled &mdash; less than 3% of the total. In the week  of the census, 3,680 of the planned 3,791 clinics took place, and the remaining  111 cancelled clinics equates to only 2&middot;9% of the total. Most cancel&shy;lations  result from staff being on sick leave. There will always be occasions on which  doctors fall ill and are absent from work at short notice. Therefore, it is  inevitable that some clinics will be cancelled.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The impact of such  cancellations is more problematic for smaller hospitals. When a  consultant in a larger hospital falls ill, a colleague routinely takes over his  or her duties, whereas smaller hospitals, in which a greater proportion of  single-handed clinics take place, may have no one available to take over at  short notice.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My Department has placed a requirement on trusts to ensure  that clinical staff, including doctors and nurses, give at least six weeks&rsquo;  notice of their planned annual or study leave. George Robinson made a point  about the planning of clinics; that requirement is designed to minimise clinic  cancellations, facilitate the proper planning of clinics and guarantee as far  as possible that when a patient is given an appointment, the clinic takes  place. As employees, the trusts must enforce that requirement and intervene  should any pattern of short-notice cancellations emerge. Trusts have confirmed that staff compliance is closely  monitored and that the cancellation of any clinic with less than six  weeks&rsquo; notice is investigated.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although we do not compare unfavourably with England, Scotland  and Wales,  it is normal for those countries to measure cancelled appointments rather than  cancelled clinics. To illustrate the point: in Northern Ireland, if Doctor  Brown is booked to do a clinic in a particular hospital at 9.00 am on Monday  morning, and Doctor Green does the clinic instead, that would be recorded as a  cancelled clinic because Doctor Brown&rsquo;s clinic has been cancelled, even though  the same patients are seen by Doctor Green. Therefore, as our counting has a  degree of correctness that results in slightly skewed figures, cancelled  appointments will be recorded instead. That  is more relevant because each cancelled  appointment involves a patient not being seen.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As I have noted already, cancelled clinics are only part of  the problem. Another part involves patients cancelling, or failing to attend,  their appointments. If patients give adequate notice when cancelling appoint&shy;ments,  their slots can be allocated to others. However, when patients cancel their  appointments at short notice &mdash; or worse &mdash; fail to attend without giving any  notice, their slot is wasted and they deprive someone else of being seen. In  2006-07, 11&middot;4% of patients failed to turn up for their appointment and did not  give any notice. In the first three quarters of 2007-08 the percentage of  patients failing to attend their appointments, although it had fallen, was  still 10&middot;6%. There is a cost of &pound;54 for every patient who does not turn up for  an appointment. Per annum, 1&middot;5 million patients are being seen, so 11% of that  is approximately 160,000 patients. Therefore, of the &pound;11&middot;6 million that is  being lost, approximately &pound;8&middot;5 million of that is the cost of patients not  turning up for appointments. The number of patients not turning up for their  appointments is still too high.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The introduction of more effective and responsive systems  for booking outpatient appointments is a key reform that will help to address  that problem. In the past, patients received a letter months in advance with a  fixed time and date for their appointment. Under that system, hospitals could  not be sure that a clinic would take place,  and there was no consideration of convenience for patients. As a result,  patients often needed to cancel their appointment because it was unsuitable, or  else they simply forgot about it. In addition, hospitals occasionally needed to  cancel the clinic because key members of staff were not available. My  Department now requires all trusts to implement new partial booking processes  to deal with that issue.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  I have gone somewhat over my time, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Much good work has been done &mdash; long waiting times are now a  thing of the past and that is welcome, as we continue to improve our  performance.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Ba mhaith liom taca&iacute;ocht a  thabhairt don r&uacute;n. First, I add my support to the motion. I apologise for my  colleague Sue Ramsey, who has to leave, and for Michelle O&rsquo;Neill, who is  elsewhere.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is very encouraging to hear about the reduction in waiting  times for patients from 26 weeks to 13 weeks, with  a view to that time being reduced further. That is a success story, as  it is an example of locally-elected rep&shy;resentatives being held to account and  taking a patient-centred approach. I also acknowledge the work that has been  done by Assembly Research and Library Service (RLS), which has provided very extensive  information in advance of the debate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Throughout the debate, the vast financial cost of cancelled clinics and missed appointments to the  health and social care services was  mentioned. During a Public Accounts Committee evidence session, it was  stated that approximately &pound;259 million is spent each year in providing outpatient services in hospitals and  community clinics. Alex Easton mentioned the cost of that, and the  Minister outlined how, of the &pound;11&middot;6 million that is being lost, approximately  &pound;8&middot;5 million of that is the cost of patients not attending their appointments.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We all took part in the debates on the draft Budget and the Budget. Although we had different  perspectives, many of us argued, as Alex Easton did today, that decades  of underinvestment in the Health Service have left gaps in provision. We have  all argued for the need for efficiency, and this is one area in which we could  all do better and be more efficient.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The reasons why clinics are cancelled and the reasons why  people do not attend their appointments have been factored into the debate. The  main reason for our amendment, which I thank  the DUP for accepting, was to ensure a more patient-centred approach. I  was encouraged by what the Minister said about reducing waiting times and about  consulting with patients on the issue of suitability, because that will lend  itself to an increased uptake of appointments.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We are all mindful of low morale among staff in the Health  Service. I do not want to call for a review for the sake of it, but somewhere  along the line we need to review how the system works and how we could do  better. We all have a job to do to ensure that patients are put first, which will involve better time management and  better management of people.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The reduction of waiting times from 26 weeks to 13 weeks,  or even further, will be no mean feat. However, the continued practice of the  overbooking of clinics &mdash; and I am sure that all Members have heard about it in  their constituencies &mdash; has to be addressed. We all have a lot of work to do in  getting that message out.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A distinction has to be made between cancelled clinics and people who do not attend their  appointments. There is also an issue about appointments for some people  being unrealistic. For example, I dealt with a case in which an elderly woman  from Fermanagh was given an appointment in Belfast for 8.30 am. That was not  patient-centred, and everyone would agree that we would be doing well to get  such practices eradicated.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is good that in debates about health issues there is a  lot that we can all say. One element that Alex Easton and others referred to  was about the amount of money that could be  saved and used for other services. However, it is also important to  point out that patients are losing out because of consultants&rsquo; conducting  private work. That can be exaggerated, but it does happen. The perception of  the public is that consultants who are paid through the NHS are using that time  to undertake private work. That needs to be investigated. It would be appropriate for an answer to be brought to the  House at some stage on that matter.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is imperative that trusts make their consultants  accountable. It is also imperative that we, as elected representatives, do our best to ensure that people get the message that missed appointments and cancelled  clinics cost a lot of money. It is good that we now have locally elected  representatives who are accountable and who are  ensuring that we are doing well for our own people.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Kieran McCarthy raised the possibility of penalties being imposed. Any penalties should be  equality-impact assessed, because there are reasons why people do not  attend appointments, including mental-health issues, which was discussed during  previous debates.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  I ask Members to support the motion and the amendment.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  It appears that all Members are of the same point of view on this issue;  therefore, I am happy to accept the amendment. Obviously, a huge problem  exists: 14,000 cancelled clinics each year, according to my calculations,  equates to approximately 280,000 missed  appointments. An extra &pound;6 million is being spent to bring in  private-sector providers to try to reduce the waiting lists. If the problem is  addressed, that money could be put to better use as part of an efficiency  drive.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The &pound;11 million cost of cancelled clinics, staff issues and  so on have been talked about. Therefore, there are huge efficiency savings that  the Minister could consider as he drives that programme forward. I hope that he  will take on board what we said.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">All of us try to do the best that we can for patients. It is hoped that this motion will be able to  offer a better, value-for-money service to patients. Consultants have a  vital role to play, and it is important that the Minister ensures that  consultants work to reduce the level of clinic cancellations.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I praise the trust staff right across the board; they do a  fantastic job for outpatients. Furthermore, I praise the Minister for reducing  waiting lists: that is a big plus.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Many Members contributed  to the debate. Sue Ramsey mentioned the costs and the need to get  serious about dealing with cancelled clinics. She talked about the Scottish  model, as did other Members, increased communication with patients, by letter  and by phone. Iris Robinson mentioned  getting rid of waste and looking for efficiencies. Furthermore, she  talked about the 11% did-not-attend rate, and about the penalties that could be  arranged for patients who miss appointments.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">John McCallister referred to mental-health patients as  being the most unlikely to attend appointments. He also mentioned the costs of  non-attendance; and the &pound;11&middot;6 million that  is wasted. Carmel Hanna talked about patients  who persistently do not attend their appointments. It is important that  patients play their part in resolving the issue &mdash; it is not simply a job for  the consultants, the Minister or even for this Assembly. Mrs Hanna mentioned  that she wanted a more comprehensive, patient-led arrangement, and she, too,  talked about the Scottish model.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Kieran McCarthy said that the Health Service numbers were a  priority for him and, possibly, for his party. He also mentioned the drain on  resources and the &pound;11&middot;6 million that is wasted. He said that patients should  advise if they cannot attend appointments &mdash; that is common courtesy. He, too,  referred to the Scottish model. Perhaps the Minister should evaluate that and  come back to the Assembly with his decision.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Jim Shannon mentioned that numerous factors were  responsible for cancelled clinics, one of which was staff taking leave. He  believed that staff should give notice of their intention to take leave, so  that administrators could arrrange cover for clinics. He mentioned that it was  up to the Minister to make sure that that happened.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Dominic Bradley talked about how some of the work of  Newry&rsquo;s Daisy Hill  Hospital was being referred to Craigavon Hospital. He was concerned that that  could lead to havoc, with patients&rsquo; notes perhaps not being available to  consultants. Perhaps the Minister should address that issue as well.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">George Robinson mentioned the waste of money, staff leave,  and the Scottish model &mdash; which seems to be quite a popular theme.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister then talked about the 13 weeks&rsquo; appointment  waiting time, which he hopes to reduce to nine weeks. He also mentioned the  booking system for appointments. Before I left the Health Service, that system  had just been implemented, and it seemed to be doing quite a good job. The  Minister also referred to the ICATS model.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McGimpsey then mentioned the &pound;11&middot;6 million wasted on cancelled clinics, and that he looked  to staff to ensure that they gave  six weeks&rsquo; notice to their managers before going on leave. He also made  reference to the rate of non-attendance, and the &pound;55 cost of someone&rsquo;s not  attending an outpatient appointment. That is quite a large amount of money.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister went on to outline the improvements that he  wanted to make; unfortunately, however, he ran out of time.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n  acknowledged the good work that has been done to reduce waiting lists.  She, too, mentioned waste, and the use by consultants of National Health  Service facilities for private work. The Minister could perhaps investigate whether valuable time is lost by that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is clear that there is a comprehensive attitude across  the Chamber, and I thank Members for their contributions. It is a good way  forward, which satisfies everyone. I am happy to accept the amendment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question, That the  amendment be made, put and agreed to.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Main Question, as amended, put and agreed to.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly calls on the Minister of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety to introduce measures to reduce the cancellation  level of outpatient clinics; and further calls for a holistic, patient-centred  approach from the Minister and his department to tackle waiting lists.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading"><a name="4"></a>Private Finance Initiatives</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30  minutes for the debate. The proposer of the  motion will have 10 minutes to propose and 10 minutes to make the  winding-up speech. All other Members who wish to speak will have five minutes.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly notes the concerns about local Private  Finance Initiatives (PFIs) raised in recent reports; and calls on the Office of  the First Minister and deputy First Minister to provide clarification on the  role and scope of PFIs across all Government Departments.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">After 30 years of conflict and the decades of  underin&shy;vestment that we are all too aware of, we now have an opportunity to  make progress and catch up with neighbouring economies. It is true that in the  past we have had some new hospitals and schools, small investment in roads and  very little investment in other parts of our infrastructure, such as water and  sewerage. Our infrastructure is in poor shape and badly in need of repair or,  in some cases, replacment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Programme for Government and the investment strategy  set out some of the actions that need to be taken to improve the infrastructure  so that we can develop a more competitive economy and, it is hoped, a more prosperous  future for the people here.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Private finance initiatives are one way of drawing in  private investment to progress some of the large capital projects. The  Government then repay their private partners &mdash; the investors &mdash; usually over a  period of 25 to 30 years, which is a long time. If circumstances change &mdash; for  example, falling enrolments in schools or school closures &mdash; the repayments must  continue. The same situation applies to hospitals, where it is often difficult  to predict future patient patterns.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The success or failure of a private finance initiative will  depend on the terms negotiated and the controls put in place when the deal is  signed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A recent newspaper article about Victoria Square, written by a well-known  commentator, stated:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;When the developers of the new Victoria Square shopping centre submitted  their initial planning application they promised Belfast City  Council that the building would contain a public library. Once the plan was  approved this promise was quietly dropped. However, when pressed on the matter,  the developers said the building would still contain a &lsquo;cultural dimension&rsquo; in  the form of a cinema and a bookshop. Visitors to the centre &hellip; will notice that  the cinema is an Odeon multiplex and the bookshop has not materialised at all.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Some other projects have been subjected to detailed  reports by both the Audit Office and the  Public Accounts Committee. As Members will know, in many cases scathing  criticism has been levelled against the public authorities who negotiated the  PFI arrangements.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We all know about the Royal Victoria   Hospital&rsquo;s car park,  which is a PFI disaster that has left the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust  badly out of pocket. How a project with the potential for generating such good  revenue was put out for private tender remains a great surprise. Instead of  that revenue going back into the Health Service, it now goes into the private  partners&rsquo; bank accounts.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There were serious  flaws in the contracts for Balmoral  High School and Wellington College,  which, as we know, resulted in the handover to the development partners of a  prime piece of development land for their own use. Last week, there were  revelations about how Invest Northern    Ireland sold, for little money, a piece of  land that was later valued on the public market at close to &pound;300,000.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Strategic Investment Board is a professional body with  links to the Office of the First Minister and deputy  First Minister (OFMDFM), and its role includes helping people who are  developing large projects to sort out problems and progress the developments as  quickly as possible. Furthermore, its role is to work with private consortia to  seek out people who are interested in advancing developments and to strive to provide efficiency, competitiveness and value for  money.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The final stages of the  biggest contract that Northern Ireland has yet seen &mdash; the &pound;260 million PFI project for the  new Enniskillen hospital &mdash; will soon be completed. Although the project is at  an advanced stage, the views of people who work in our hospitals are still  worth hearing and, given that much has happened and there has been little  information, I am sure that the public also wishes to know more.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The British Medical Association (BMA) opposes the use of  PFIs in the National Health Service, and its members consider PFI to be an  expensive borrowing mechanism that drains funds from the Health Service and  stores debts for the future.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In England,  there have many mistakes in hospital development. The Queen Elizabeth Hospital  NHS Trust in Greenwich  has a debt of almost &pound;20 million and, since getting into that arrangement, it  must pay &pound;15 million per annum to its private partner.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Big money is involved in hospitals, and predictions about  future patient patterns are difficult and risky. Therefore, one must be careful  about getting involved in Health Service private finance initiatives.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In addition to the BMA,  the unions have aired genuine concerns. Staff at the new Enniskillen  hospital are still uncertain about their future. For example, catering  arrangements are a matter for speculation, centring on the possibility that a  successful consortium might fly frozen food in from England. What about carbon  footprints, which are mentioned in the Assembly from time to time? What about yesterday&rsquo;s agriculture debate? There  should be incentives for local food producers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The protection of staff&rsquo;s terms and conditions must be a  high priority in all future PFI contracts. The Department of Finance and  Personnel &mdash; which is handling Workplace 2010 &mdash; indicated that there will be no  compulsory transfers for its support staff, such as porters and front-desk  staff. In the interests of fairness and  equality, that right should be afforded to all support staff in the  sector, whether they work in schools or hospitals, and the Executive should  carefully consider that matter and pledge that, under any future PFI  arrangements, there will be no differential treatment between people who work  in the Civil Service and those who work in the wider public service.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Another inconsistency in the hospital plan for the west has  emerged. The Western Health and Social Care Trust allows private bidders the  option of including cleaning and catering services in the contract, whereas the  Belfast Trust has removed those services from PFI negotiations altogether. Both  staff and unions have welcomed what should be standard practice in all public  bodies and authorities during negotiations on PFI contracts.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members need  clarification, as the motion states, on the &ldquo;role and scope&rdquo; of private finance initiatives. Members must  bear in mind all the concerns that I have raised.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.  This is the second debate today that originates from a Public Accounts  Committee report. That stands to the credit of the Committee, which has  investigated a variety of fields since restoration of the institutions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">One of the Committee&rsquo;s reports that investigated PFI was on  the transfer of surplus land in the PFI education pathfinder projects. Read  together with the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report, &lsquo;Transfer of Surplus Land in the PFI Education Pathfinder  Projects&rsquo;, it is a most important document. The Committee&rsquo;s report made  16 recommendations as to how future PFI and PPP contracts should be approached.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in is not in favour of either the PFI or the PPP  approach to provision of public-sector facilities, but we are faced with  economic realities. Insufficient funds are available in the current block grant  and in British Exchequer allocations to the Executive in order to pay for the  required projects. We are faced with a future that contains PFI and PPP  arrangements, but we must ensure that they are properly managed. From the  start, contracts must be copper-fastened to protect the public purse and public  services.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Public Accounts Committee report is therefore vital. I welcome the fact that the Department of  Finance and Personnel accepted more than 90% of the Comm&shy;ittee&rsquo;s  recommendations as to how PFI contracts should be implemented.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We learned from pathfinder projects that the private sector  had the ability, skills and financial backing to run rings around the public  sector in negotiations. In some cases, contracts allowed millions and millions  of pounds to be made from public resources. With the benefit of hindsight,  those loopholes should have been identified straight away. Lands sold for  building turned out to be prime development  sites but were not identified as such. Public-sector negotiators were  more interested in hastening the signing of the contract, in ensuring that  buildings were constructed and in providing for public services. However, they  should have taken care, in the first instance, to protect the public purse and  to ensure that any excess profits that such schemes generated were shared with  the public sector. All those lessons must be learned.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Public-sector workers  can also find themselves caught up in PFI and PPP contracts. Those  workers, and their position in the public sector, must be protected in future  contracts. They should not be allowed simply to slip into the private sector.  In the report into the PFI project at the Enniskillen hospital, confidence in  hospital cleaning services rose not only among staff but among patients when  responsibility for those services was returned to the public sector. We must  ensure that jobs are protected and kept in the sector.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, we must ensure that our civil servants have  the necessary resources, skills and experience to undertake such negotiations.  They must be sufficiently skilled in order  to protect the public purse in all instances, because it is important that they secure the best possible deal  in future PFI and PPP negotiations.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Private finance  initiatives and public-private partner&shy;ships should not be the first  option. Although it has been acknowledged that the current economic climate is  dire, senior civil servants should not automatically look at the PFI option. Other dynamic ways of providing public  services should be examined, and contracts should not always be given to the  private sector. There are times when the community and voluntary sector can  also be involved in the provision of such services. Those areas should also be  examined.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, this is clearly not Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s first option  for the development of public services, but we are faced with harsh economic  realities. When civil servants and Ministers reach the point of signing-off on  such contracts, lessons from the Public Accounts Committee&rsquo;s &lsquo;Report on the  Transfer of Surplus Land in the PFI Education Pathfinder Projects&rsquo;, must be  learnt, and we have to ensure that the public purse is protected. Go raibh  maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I wish to make it clear that the Ulster Unionist Party has no difficulty in  principle with the idea of public/private finance initiatives. In the present  constrained climate of Government spending, PFIs may be the only way to realise important and necessary capital expenditure projects which are otherwise  unreal&shy;isable, no matter how important they may be to the infrastructural base for economic progress. The  problem with all such projects is that the devil is in the detail.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Difficulty often arises in the awareness level among public  sector workers and civil servants of the com&shy;plexities of commercial and  banking practices. Many issues that have arisen and have incurred criticism  after the event have centred mainly on the terms of PFI agreements &mdash; they have  often had their origin in the lack of commercial expertise among those public  servants who were charged with the intricacies of negotiation in a field which was alien to their experience.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Strategic Investment Board (SIB) is designed to play a  key role in providing advice on a public sector investment strategy for Northern Ireland.  It is meant to work closely with the Northern Ireland Departments in the development of strategically important PFI  projects. The SIB should be assisted in this role by a new public  private investment unit (PPIU). PPIU is charged with advising the central  finance group in the Department of Finance  and Personnel on PPP policy matters through the economic policy unit in  the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister. I welcome the  presence of junior Minister Kelly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">PPIU will consult the  Central Procurement Directorate regarding  general procurement policy issues. Although that looks like a fail-safe  mechanism, it also looks exceedingly complex. The danger in the involvement of  so many Government bodies is that responsibility and accountability will be lost in the morass of competing  authorities. One can almost imagine oneself reading a highly critical Public  Accounts Committee report in the future condemning the complexity and lack of  clarity in the system.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to draw attention to the current commercial  practices of private equity funds which have recently occasioned public comment  and criticism. The Government need to be  alert to the commercial practices and complex financial operations of  these funds. Many PFI contracts fail to provide real risk transfer from the  public sector to the private sector.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I believe that  transferring debt from the Government&rsquo;s balance sheet often comes at a cost of billions of pounds. PFI  revenue commitments are often entered into by the Government, limiting the  spending options of future Administrations. PFI contract failures can also lead  to public bodies paying more for service delivery, even though they may not be  to blame for failure.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I sound a note of caution about the operation of the  proposed emerald fund. I welcome that vehicle for American investment in Northern Ireland  &mdash; as have most people and most Members. However, we must ensure that the fund  remains money from America  and does not become money to America. We  must be careful about the disposal of publicly owned assets as part of  any deal that involves infrastructural improvement and property-based  investment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I remind the House of the Northern Ireland Audit Office&rsquo;s  findings on Balmoral   High School and other  projects. The Audit Office said that four out of five contracts contained  clauses that resulted in the transfer of surplus land from the public sector to  the successful operator. That transfer of land received great criticism and  scrutiny. The report concluded that the transfer of surplus land brought with it risks to the value for money  obtained, especially in light of the volatile nature of land values. The  negotiation of clawback clauses in contracts that protect the public sector&rsquo;s  interest will be a vital component of all future arrangements.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I welcome and support the motion: it is timely. The Alliance  Party takes a pragmatic approach to issues regarding private finance  initiatives and public-private partnerships  &mdash; a view shared by other Members. The party has no ideological  difficulty with such initiatives, but they must be judged case by case, and great  care must be taken to ensure that whatever is implemented is in the public  interest.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is much to be  said for the increasing involvement of the private sector in the  delivery of some public goods. The private sector brings with it a market  discipline and creative market solutions. For too long, the thinking in Northern Ireland  has been that the public sector is good and the private sector is bad. We must  overcome that mentality and recognise that there is nothing wrong with  companies seeking to make a profit, so long as it falls within a particular  framework. We must accept that as we seek  to develop the economy in Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, there are a number of issues about which we must  be cautious when considering matters relating to private finance initiatives.  Contracts &mdash; especially long-term contracts &mdash; must be flexible. As other Members  have said, we must ensure that mistakes are not made in the early stages of the  establishment of a contract because, once a mistake is embedded in a contract, one  can end up paying for something over a long time. Many people are uncomfortable  with that, and it is, perhaps, the greatest fear that people have about PFIs.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Measures to deal with clawback and situations in which  companies are making super-profits that are above the initial negotiations&rsquo;  expected profit line must also be introduced.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must be conscious of changing circumstances. Members  have talked about schools where the demo&shy;graphic downturn means that 50,000  empty school places are forecast for 2012. We must avoid a situation in which  we will be locked into the provision of school facilities when the school  population is declining; that will mean that  we will end up paying for empty class&shy;rooms in the future.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must also be conscious of changing technology and patterns of work. I am mindful of the radical  changes that have taken place in offices over the past 20 years through  the use of computers and other forms of information technology. The scale of  that revolution was not anticipated in 1990, and, today, we cannot anticipate  the changes that will take place over the next 20 years and beyond.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must also protect our ability as an Assembly to set and  change policies. To use another example from the education sector, I am mindful  that we are waiting for a formal policy for sustainable schools from the  Minister of Education. That may have a radical impact on how we manage our schools estate. If a number of our schools  are locked into PFI contracts, policy flexibility may be constrained.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">What appears to be good practice in public policy today may  in a very short period of time, in two or three years perhaps, be regarded as  out of date and in need of change. There  might then be a possible solution in which we can deliver services in a  much more cost effective manner.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The point has been made regularly in the Assembly about the  embedded cost to society in trying to manage divisions  as oppose to building a shared future. Long-term savings can be made, and there are dangers to the public purse if  we end up locking ourselves into the provision of public services on a  segregated basis.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Having fixed payments for service charges creates a tight  budget and a need for savings to be made. If the costs in PFI contracts are  fixed, savings have to be made elsewhere over a much narrower range, and that  could lead to a loss of front-line services.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Community planning  needs to be examined to ensure that non-economic benefits from  investments made in the public estate are  captured. Schools, for example, are not just for education; they can  also be for community provision. It should not end up that communities are  charged at the market rate for something that is of social value.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, there is a lot of fear that Northern Ireland  businesses are being locked out of not just local PFI contracts but of broader  public-sector procurement. I know that there are European rules in place but  the concern remains that it is not quite a  level playing field.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>: Most Members have already acknow&shy;ledged that PFIs are part of  the public sector way of life now whether we like it or not. I am glad that the  motion has been brought forward in its  present tone and that it is not a complete repudiation of PFI.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have noted that Sinn F&eacute;in, in the persona of Mr O&rsquo;Dowd,  despite constant opposition previously, has acknowledged  that in the face of harsh economic realities PFIs are part and parcel of  public-sector procurement and will probably &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>: Does the Member accept the important analogy, once used by Margaret  Thatcher of all people, which references the parable of the Good Samaritan? The  Good Samaritan was only able to provide medical attention for the injured man  because of his wealth &mdash; the generation of wealth is not in itself a sin.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I have long supported increased private-sector involvement in Northern Ireland  and I could not agree more with Dr Farry on that point. I also agree with Mr  Kennedy that the private sector should be encouraged. That is the nub of the  economic problem Northern Ireland  faces: the private sector cannot be encouraged to get involved if it is not  also encouraged to make money. Making money is what drives the private sector,  and that is what we should be encouraging now. I support that sentiment and I  welcome Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s conversion &mdash; its Damascene conversion, to extend the  biblical analogy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am glad that the motion has not been a repudiation of PFI  and is instead focused on improving the public sector&rsquo;s performance when dealing with the private sector.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My party and I have no ideological objections to PFI. I  support PFIs, having seen investment occurring in my own constituency,  following co-operation with the private sector, which would not have happened  without PFI. Comber has a brand spanking new secondary school, Nendrum College, which was built through a PFI  contract. Like many people in my part of the world, I wonder how long we would  have had to wait for that school had it not been for PFI.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The A20 southern distributor road in Newtownards is another example. At the official sod-cutting  ceremony recently, Minister Murphy described the road as an excellent  example of how both public- and private-sector bodies can work in partnership  on a project that will ease congestion and  improve journey times and safety for all. Indeed, a DRD official at a  public consultation meeting about the new road said that if it were not for the  private sector contribution the road would not have been built and we would  have been left waiting a hell of a long time for it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are many lessons to be learned, and in my short time  in the Assembly I have been involved in two Committees that have produced two  reports touching on this area. One is the aforementioned PAC report and the  other was a report by the Committee for Finance and Personnel into Workplace  2010. Certainly, lessons have been learnt from the PFI experience, and that was  initially what some of that process was about. The term &ldquo;pathfinder project&rdquo;  says it all: it was about finding a path for the best way forward.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mistakes were made in the past, some of them monumental.  For example, an acre and a half of land was sold for the value of one acre  because it had not been measured properly. The proposer of the motion and other  Members trotted out some of the classic cases, including Balmoral  High School and the Royal Victoria   Hospital. We could  concentrate on those all day, but we should not bypass some of the mistakes  that have been made with traditional procurement. Recently I heard that,  compared with PFI, conventional procurement is frequently over budget and over  time. When dwelling on the past mistakes of private finance initiatives, the  successes of PFI and private-sector involvement are not mentioned. The  Westlink, for example, is well ahead of schedule; that project has heavy private-sector  involvement.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As was mentioned by other Members, the PAC report  recommended that the public sector be much more commercially minded when  dealing with the private sector. It said that the public sector should be  skilled in areas such as the valuing of land and the drawing up of contracts.  Those are good lessons, and we should strive to see them enacted throughout the  public sector. In every aspect of the public sector&rsquo;s dealings with the private  sector, it should be just as good and just as tuned into the issues as the  private sector. If that were the case, our eye would not be wiped in some of  the ways that have been suggested.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I welcome the debate. The  issue of PFIs and PPPs is a controversial one. I note that successive reports  from the audit authorities in Britain,  and in Ireland,  North and South &mdash; including the Six Counties &mdash; have concluded that PFI does not  represent value for money. That is the position of my party, and that is the  position that I represent.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I acknowledge that  Departments are now considerably more cautious when entering PFI  contracts than they were initially. We must still be exceptionally careful and  prudent. As private projects generally cost the Executive more in the medium to  long term, the ability of future Executives to deploy their Budget resources  will be compromised by that effective mortgaging of Executive money to the here  and now. Some of the major criticisms of PFI reflect that it is an expensive  and wasteful method of financing public investment and that it will damage  public services now and for generations to come.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A growing body of evidence demonstrates that PFI and PPP  contracts escalate in scale and cost, leading to an affordability gap that is  met from other parts of the public sector  and by reductions in services and capacity. Those critics point out that PFI and PPP reduce standards of  pay, conditions and employment prospects and that they represent a huge  increase in the privatisation of economic and social life, including the  determination of public services by, in many instances, unaccountable  commercial criteria, rather than social need. The use of such funding creates  serious democratic dynamics.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those arguments are accurate and relevant, even to those  who support PFI. As MLAs, we must take account of that in our representative  capacity. That advice also applies to those with ministerial authority. The  continued use of PFI projects will result in a substantial drop in the overall  annual spending Budget that is available to the Executive in 10 or 20 years&rsquo;  time, as we are effectively front-loading investment. Therefore, there will be  a longer-term political cost of being associated with PFI decisions, if the  cake, which is already too small, will be smaller as a result of the decisions  that are made today.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the North, PFI deals have tended to involve the  permanent sale of public assets.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I support the establishment of the capital realisation task  force. It is arguable that in certain cases it makes sense to sell off assets,  because the public sector is flabby; it carries and stockpiles assets that it  has no resources or immediate intention to deploy. In those circumstances it is possible to make a rational  argument for creating resources or meeting pressures that other  Departments face in delivering on their duties and requirements under the  Programme for Government.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Where those arguments can be identified, Sinn F&eacute;in will not  oppose the disposal or redeployment of those assets to produce sensible  outcomes. However, in the North, the  inclusion of significant asset disposals as part of PFI deals has led to  poor-value returns. In fact, the Public Accounts Committee has reported on  significant examples where that has already happened.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In many instances, private-sector negotiators and their  legal advisors are sharper and more able operators than the Departments. That is understandable. However, it also  highlights why people need to be exceptionally careful when addressing those issues and engaging with people  who are much more experienced and who have a clear and driving ambition to  maximise their profit.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must address the reality of PFI. The Assembly is not yet  in a position of agreement on either a preferred option or a preferred  alternative option; until such time that there is agreement, we must be  careful.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  welcome the motion. I also welcome the constructive tone of the debate, from  which I hope lessons can be learned and passed on to officials and civil  servants for the benefit of the community.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Whether we like it or not, private finance initiatives are  an established part of Her Majesty&rsquo;s approach to public procurement and have been used in Great Britain for many  years. That means that there is insufficient money released through the  block-grant mechanism to enable us to build schools and hospitals.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In Northern Ireland,  the PFI policy was set out under the policy framework for public-private  partnerships, which was first published by the Office of the First Minister and  deputy First Minister in 2003. It may be time  for a review, and I hope that the OFMDFM Comm&shy;ittee and the Ministers  will examine that. There have been many changes since then, and new practices  have been developed. There may well be a need for a review of official policy  in order to learn from those changes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As my colleague Danny Kennedy said, the Ulster Unionist  Party&rsquo;s approach to PFI is not dogmatic or ideological but based on the  pragmatic assessment of individual cases: do we and the public benefit? Due to Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  massive infrastructure deficit, we must consider the best way to deliver major  capital projects &mdash; across all Departments &mdash; including schools, houses, roads,  hospitals and water.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the method develop the project in an efficient manner  that represents the best value for taxpayers and allows more projects to be developed, and more schools and  hospitals to be built? That should be the real test of any decision &mdash; not some  rigid approach.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There can be a tendency among some politicians to think in  the short term; they would say that private finance initiatives are best.  However, we must look at the long-term implications. I share the view that we  must examine the long-term cost to ensure that any financial arrangements that  we are being tied in to benefit the public in the long term, and are not just a  quick method of getting something built.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Several Members mentioned Balmoral High School,  and there are fundamental questions to be asked about that project. It was not  just a PFI disaster; it was a Department of Education (DE) disaster. Whether  the school was built through PFI or directly with public money from the block  grant does not matter; it was a waste of money.  There was no need for the school; the fundamental fault occurred at an  earlier stage, and the PFI project did not help. Projects can go wrong whether  they are funded by PFI or by direct public funding.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Audit Office has highlighted good practice in the development of the renal unit of Antrim Area   Hospital through a  PFI scheme. The Audit Office recognised that value for money was achieved by  bringing in experts in the field who won the contract, and that:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the project objectives were clear, focusing on what  United Hospitals wanted having regard to what the private sector could supply;  &hellip; an outline business case &hellip; showed that a PFI approach could deliver value for  money; and &hellip; a suitably qualified and experienced Project Board&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">had oversight of the work, which is in line with  best practice and is another essential requirement of any such scheme. We have  learned from some of the pilot projects that the limited experience of the  public sector has allowed the private  sector to wipe the eye of the public sector and make good money out of  public funding.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must learn the lessons of those experiences. The new  gateway process includes independent review at various stages so that the work  can be double-checked to ensure value for money for the public. PFI has advantages and disadvantages; we must take a  balanced approach to ensure the delivery of value for money and good  public services.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>: I thank Mr Gallagher for proposing the motion. It is important  that we debate this issue; it has been a good debate, and Mr Gallagher has done  a great service to the House. I support his motion, which notes the concerns about local private finance  initiatives that have been raised in recent reports. Those reports were mentioned by Mr O&rsquo;Dowd, who is the  Chairperson of the Public Accounts Committee.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that the Office of the First Minister and  deputy First Minister take on board the sometimes scathing criticisms of PFI  projects involving the local Administration.  The SDLP has no ideological objection to  PFIs or PPPs, but the party takes a politically cautious approach to  their application. PFIs were introduced in Britain  in 1992 by the then Conservative Government because they had, apparently,  proved successful in the United    States. The Government regarded this new initiative as a way of easing the burden on  public finances. Of course, it does  ease the burden &mdash; at least temporarily &mdash; on public finances.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">PFI provides a short-term gain and a short-term solution to  the pressures on public finances, but the problem that lies behind the constant  and repetitive use of PPPs or PFIs is that they can add to the long-term  financial burden on public administration. That has not really been addressed  in the debate. I urge the Executive to  examine the situation, because there will come a point when the numbers of PFIs in existence will  overburden the capacity of the local exchequer to deal with the financing and  repayment of the debt incurred.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I concur with the remarks that other Members made about being careful about the contracts for such  initiatives. It is important that we get value for money and that the  contracts are transparent and offer some form of accountability.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Despite the complexity  of the contracts, it is important that the public and the Assembly know  about them. We should also be reassured that they are for the public good. It  is important that the terms and conditions of public-sector employees who work  with PFI projects are effectively protected and guaranteed. It would be wrong for us to permit a situation to develop  that allows employees who worked in the public sector to be  disadvantaged as a result of moving into the private sector. That is an  important point to consider.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">One further aspect is  that the moneys that are expended on  PFIs should effectively be additional to public finances; they should  not be a substitution. Additionality should be built in if any real benefit is  to be gained from such initiatives. With those qualifications, the SDLP broadly  supports PFIs and, of course, Mr Gallagher&rsquo;s motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I also welcome the opportunity to  take part in the debate. The use of PFIs to develop and progress Government  projects has been criticised in several recent reports. Although it is hailed  as a means to save the taxpayer money and as a way of providing good value for  money, PFI can often cost more &mdash; a lot more &mdash; to the public purse than other  more traditional means of procurement.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is little doubt  that there is a need for efficiency and effectiveness in the way that  public services are developed and delivered. However, PFI involves public  bodies entering into long-term contracts with private developers where changes  in what is needed can occur during the lifetime of the contract. That, in  effect, means that if a project or a service that is provided by a PFI changes  or is no longer needed, it must still be paid for from the public purse. That  results in the taxpayer funding guaranteed profits for private-sector  companies.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We are being forced down this route as a result of the  approach of the previous Finance Minister, who was from the SDLP, and that of  the current DUP incumbent. A lack of money and a lack of financial independence  lie at the heart of the issue. Until we move further towards fiscal  independence and take greater financial control, we will not be in a position  to develop our own long-term solution to the deficits that were delivered by  the British Exchequer.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Several reports into  PFIs have already been discussed. The report into the education  pathfinder projects, which saw public lands being given over to private  developers as part of the contract to build new schools, found that the land in  question was sold for far less than its market value.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those reports, including  one from the British Medical Association,  have been critical of the way in which PFI contracts in the Health  Service are not delivering an adequate level  of patient care, but are, in fact, increasing debt levels in the Health  Service. For proof of that, we need only look to the Royal  Victoria Hospital  in West Belfast where the car park has already  paid for itself through charges to visitors and patients, yet the private  developer still benefits from current and future profits. Those profits could have been directed into  patient care at the hospital had it  not been for the existing PFI contract.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Several reports on  Workplace 2010 have been critical of the way in which the Government are  considering and entering into PFI  contracts. A report by the Committee for Finance and Personnel, which  has been debated already today, raises several important questions about the  efficiency of PFI schemes, particularly at one of the pilot projects at Clare  House.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The report also raised important questions about how the  Department of Finance and Personnel has assessed the long-term impact of PFI  projects on the public purse. It has been claimed that, in order to justify PFI  options, Departments have relied too heavily on public-sector comparators, and  that there should be a wider examination of all the alternatives before a  value-for-money assessment is made.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The successful management and delivery of PFI projects in  recent years has also caused concern. The Clare House project is an example of  how problems can arise that cause  disruption to staff and to the service that they provide to the public.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in believes strongly that PFI represents poor value  for the public sector, and that public-service provision under PFI will create  problems.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  No. I have only five minutes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The net result of setting PFI contracts will be that the  Executive will progressively take on more long-term debt and that a larger  proportion of the finances that are available to Ministers in the future will  be taken up by the repayments under those contracts. Ministers should make it  clear to their Departments that PFI contracts are not always the preferred  option, and they should instruct their civil servants, and those responsible for designing projects, to put equal  or greater effort into seeking alternative funding models to PFI.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Project schemes should encourage incentives for managers to  supply better services at a lower cost to the public. Under no circumstances  should they reward managers for making a  bigger profit for a private provider at the expense of the public.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those who manage or benefit from PFI must be made to follow  transparent practices, be open to public inspection of their activities and be  held strictly accountable for any irregularities that are uncovered. Private  partners must have no say in the management of schools or hospitals, nor any  power to affect levels of public-service provision.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Deeny</strong>: I  welcome and support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As Mr Hamilton is, I am delighted that there is a college  in Omagh that is funded through PFI. However, before we get carried away with  the notion that PFI is the funding solution for all future projects, it is  worth recalling what it involves.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Under PFI a facility such as a hospital or a school is  built by a private company or consortium, and we taxpayers pay for it over the next 30 years. That means that our  children will also pay. It is worth remembering that PFI is a 30-year commitment, and that it is similar to a  mortgage because we pay back four, five or even six times the initial sum that  was spent. However, PFI is worse than a mortgage because we have no say over  any amendments that are made. PFI projects are a big commitment and must be  well thought out, well costed and &mdash; as highlighted by the case of Balmoral High School &mdash; sustainable and built in  the correct place.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A report carried out by Manchester Business   School estimates that PFI  hospitals cost the National Health Service &pound;480 million a year. Across the  water, PFI charges remain fixed at 12% of a health and social care trust&rsquo;s  income. Therefore, before other services are paid for, 12% of the money that is  available to a trust is spent on PFI projects. The headline of an article on  the &lsquo;Building Design&rsquo; website from July 2007 states:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Leicester axes PFI  hospitals as costs soar&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The article continues:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;A huge PFI hospital project in Leicester  by BDP Architects has been scrapped after costs rose from &pound;711 million to a  staggering &pound;921 million.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Similarly, a new project at Edinburgh Royal  Infirmary was costed at &pound;180 million for a Government-financed build. However,  the PFI build was calculated to cost &pound;990 million. That hospital has already  lost 200 beds and 890 staff.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A side effect of PFI is job losses, including among  front-line staff, as seen in hospitals across the water. A few years ago, London hospitals were  poised to enter PFI projects when they realised the pitfalls and bought  themselves out of the deals before they started, at a cost of more than &pound;10  million.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">University Hospital Coventry  was told that it would have to lose 25% of its beds and 20% of its staff in  order to make the profits needed for PFI payments. A refurbishment contract  would have required a one-off payment of &pound;30 million, but it was not considered  because it was too cheap to attract PFI companies. The local primary care trust  loaned the hospital &pound;27 million towards the payment, but it cannot repeat that  gesture. In Coventry,  two operating theatres and 60 beds were closed, 45 more earmarked for closure,  and 250 staff are being laid off &mdash; all in an effort to pay the rent.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Hospital spending in Manchester  hit &pound;422 million &mdash; a figure similar to that proposed for the Tyrone and  Fermanagh projects. What is planned for us in Tyrone &mdash; at a cost of &pound;190  million &mdash; is not a hospital but a building with no life-saving services. By the  time the hospital in Manchester  is paid for, it will have cost at least &pound;3 billion over 30 years. Members, that  is the sort of money that we and our children will have to pay back over 30  years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The only thing that health trusts can do to service a debt  created by PFI hospital projects is to lay off staff; hence doctors and nurses  are emigrating in droves. It is estimated that for every &pound;200 million spent on  PFI, 1,000 medical and nursing staff are lost to the service. Can we afford to  sink so much money into hospital buildings when we need services rather than  buildings?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Health economists and market analysts predict that PFI has  had its day, as the Government move towards smaller-scale, localised services.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister) (Mr G Kelly)</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I am here to defend the whole  Executive. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span> This has been a good debate  and Members have raised issues on which I will touch. We will be taking  cognisance of all the points that were made.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion calls on the Office of the First Minister and  deputy First Minister to provide clarification on the role and scope of PFIs  across all Departments. I will summarise how the Administration views PFI as an  approach to new investment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members need not be reminded &mdash; indeed many spoke of it &mdash;  that this part of Ireland  has suffered from years of underinvestment. That is reflected in the state of our aging hospitals and schools, the  inadequacy of our social and affordable housing stock and the deterioration in our roads, sewerage and water  systems, all of which we must now address.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The renewal and development of our infrastructure is a  tangible aspect of the wider political and economic transformation that must  take place if our community is to prosper. The commitment by the Executive and  the Assembly must be underlined by Departments translating investment  strategies into timely, delivered projects &mdash;  opening new roads, schools, health facilities, and delivering social and  affordable housing on time and to meet people&rsquo;s needs and expectations.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the meantime, the Executive need to fulfil the needs of  our people and keep our options open for how we  deliver new investment. PFI is one of several options. We must consider  where and how the private sector can best play its part. Our programmes are  ambitious, but our needs are great. We must  do everything possible to maximise  the results that we achieve for the community within the resources  available to us.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive do not specifically prefer PFI as a funding  mechanism; they expect that most of the investment strategy will be delivered  by conventional funding, as in Britain and in  the South. As some Members said, PFI should be used only when it  demonstrates better value for money than a conventional option over the  lifetime of a contract. Safeguards should be built into any PFI projects to  protect public finances and the rights of workers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Private finance initiatives have been in operation locally  for more than 12 years. Most local projects were initiated before the  restoration of the institutions and the Executive in May 2007. Indeed, PFI was  introduced by the previous Executive.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members referred to reports on PFI projects elsewhere.  Much of what has been said therefore concerns decisions to which this  Administration was not a party. Experiences of PFI projects reflected in  reports by bodies such as the Audit Offices here, in Britain and in the South have been  mixed. We must learn from what works, such as the roads package 1, for example. We must avoid the past mistakes  mentioned by some Members, such as Balmoral  High School and the Royal Victoria   Hospital car park.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Early local PFIs have tended to attract the most criticism  here. They were generally small-scale health and education projects covering  the provision of accommodation, equipment  and information technology. Realistically, the majority of those older  projects would not be undertaken today using PFI, as it now tends to be used in  large-scale infrastructure projects. PFI is a more complex approach than  conventional procurement. There is a high initial overhead for procurement,  affecting the public and private sectors.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Since 2003, PFI has  been considered as an option only for larger projects with a capital  value of more than &pound;20 million. It was  decided not to use PFI for the delivery of information technology. Those changes were designed to help  focus effort on areas where PFI appeared to have the potential to be most  effective in delivering benefits to the public sector. That in itself indicates  that there is a continual review of the use of PFI. That issue was raised by  Roy Beggs. In response to concerns, a more detailed approach to PFIs has been  adopted, reflecting the experience gained and lessons learned.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Strategic Investment Board (SIB), which was conceived  during the previous Executive, has a crucial role in helping the Executive to  mobilise effectively the substantial  resources available for investment, which amount to approximately &pound;20  billion over the next 10 years. The Strategic Investment Board&rsquo;s expertise is  available to Departments to help them to decide on the most appropriate methods  of procuring and delivering major  investments. That includes a range of procurement methods, including  conventional procurement and PFI.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is critical that we  use our unprecedented opportunity for new investment wisely. That means  creating the right infrastructure to meet the present and future needs of our  people and acquiring it at best value for money over its lifetime.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to note  that SIB is not a policy-making body &mdash; it is a delivery body, which  operates within the Office of the First  Minister and deputy First Minister. It was established by the Executive  to help the public sector to deliver major value for money infrastructural  programmes. This Administration are responsible for more than &pound;720 million  worth of PFI contracts. A full list of current PFI contracts is included in the  response to AQW 5104/08, as asked by Mr Gallagher. I take this opportunity to apologise to the Member for the  delay in providing him with that information.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Initial evidence suggests that recent deals have resulted  in savings for the public purse. For example, the Water Service has  acknowledged a 25% saving on the original capital estimates for project Alpha,  which will provide us with clean water. In the case of roads package 1, which has seen &mdash; among other  improvements &mdash; major redevelopment at the Westlink, the saving is  estimated at 15% on the original capital estimates. Those figures represent  substantial savings that are available to fund other priority projects.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Some PFI projects have had a better track record in  delivering projects on time and on budget. Designing the detail of contracts to  a high standard is crucial in ensuring that the initial benefits are not  diluted by excessive costs arising during the  operation of contracts. The motion raises concern about PFI projects,  and we understand those concerns. We can all cite PFI projects that did not  provide value for money and that were not in the public interest.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, one of the key areas highlighted in the Programme  for Government and in the investment strategy is a growing opportunity to build  socially beneficial outcomes into public  procurement and public contracting. Mitchel McLaughlin mentioned that  issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">New Government guidelines for embedding quality and  sustainability into public procurement have been agreed and will be published  in the near future. PFI projects, in line  with other methods of public procurement, will be subject to those  guidelines. PFI is only one of a range of procurement models available to  Ministers and to the Executive, and I assure Members that PFI projects are  subject to rigorous analysis to ensure that they deliver value for money before  they are approved.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Such analysis covers the  full costs over the entire lifetime of the contracts &mdash; which is  typically 25 to 30 years &mdash; not just initial contract costs. Final decisions on  PFI rest with Departments and their  Ministers, but it is right that such decisions are properly taken on the  basis of objective evidence and analysis. The  Executive intend to do their utmost to provide the best possible service  to our community at best value for money. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  thank the proposer of the motion for introducing it; it has been a useful  debate. If nothing else, it may have encouraged people like me to read up  thoroughly on the subject. I would like to praise our Assembly research staff for the excellent documentation that they put together, which I read from cover  to cover. I thank all those who  participated in the debate, partic&shy;ularly the junior Minister for his attendance and response.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We should not take an ideological view on PFIs. I think,  with some variation in words, that that was the stance taken by all Members and all parties, particularly the  lead Members to speak for their parties: Tommy Gallagher, John O&rsquo;Dowd, Danny  Kennedy, Stephen Farry, and the junior  Minister on behalf of the Executive. PFIs are not a zero sum game &mdash; if  the private sector gains, the public sector does not automatically lose.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Major public capital projects can be funded in three main  ways: we can pay the bill outright from taxation already acquired, although we  cannot often do that; we can borrow, usually over the lifetime of the asset; or  we can use PFI and enter into a partnership between the private and public  sectors. PFIs are not all bad, as some  suggest. An analogy can be made with mortgages, which enable huge  investment in property that would not otherwise happen. However, sub prime  mortgages are bad &mdash; they are based on those who simply cannot afford them; they  have done colossal damage to international confidence in banking and  construction. Likewise, badly constructed PFIs do not serve the public, but  well-constructed PFIs may do so. They lead to investment and construction that  may otherwise not happen.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Several Members, including Simon Hamilton, referred to PFI  projects in their constituencies. The question remains whether PFIs provide  value for money in every instance. Roy Beggs referred to the value for money  issue being tested in the long term, whereas Jennifer McCann was more  pessimistic, essentially saying that PFI simply does not give value for money  at all.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A case can be made in favour of PFIs, which fundamentally  involve a sharing of the risk and the reward between the public and the private  sector. The private sector is good at certain things; the Treasury and the National Audit Office say  that PFI deals are much more likely to be delivered on time and on budget.  There is an argument that the detailed working out of a specification can  create greater visibility of the long-term consequences of decisions. In the  conventional processes, those may be obscured or only become apparent  afterwards at greater cost. However, whether  the PFI process provides greater visibility to the democratic process is  open to question, and Alban Maginness referred to the lack of accountability  and democratic control.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The case against PFIs is also clear. There have been many  fiascos, with huge unanticipated cost to the public sector and profits to the  private sector that have been totally out  of proportion to its risk and investment. Some of those problems have  been illustrated locally: several Members cited Balmoral High School  as an example of a PFI project that has to be paid for long after the school  closes. However, as Roy Beggs pointed out, we should not forget that there  would have been a problem even under conventional financing.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The basic mistake was to build a permanent school that  would not be needed six years later. The car park at the Royal Victoria   Hospital was also cited  as an example of such a project.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the case of a multi-school PFI, a problem such as  planning approval at one site can hold up work on all the other sites. Many  problems have been exposed: the inclusion of surplus land under bad terms for  the public sector; the lack of good clawback terms in the event of  higher-than-expected profits; weak legal drafting; the difficulty of getting a  sound project in place when it involves new technology, including IT; weak  project management; and poor budgetary control of the project-delivery stage.  Stephen Farry outlined a number of other potential problems with PFI, and it would be useful to note and address them. Such  problems include the inability to adapt to new technology in future &mdash; we could be locked into a type of  contract that may not turn out to give good service down the years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A major concern is the structuring of PFI contracts, which  restricts local firms&rsquo; ability to bid successfully for them. That may be  because of the size of the contracts or because of rules on employment and  other matters that may rule out local firms, even though they may be well  capable of performing the work. That crucial issue must be addressed. We must  not build in obstacles to the growth of our own businesses. Several Members,  including Tommy Gallagher, John O&rsquo;Dowd and junior Minister Kelly, mentioned the  need to protect our existing workers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The consequences of the long-term financial burden may  appear acceptable at the outset, but, as the years go on, they may become  unacceptable or unaffordable. That point was made by several Members, including  Mitchel McLaughlin and Alban Maginness, and Kieran Deeny specifically mentioned  the consequences for the Health Service.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A big question is whether enough has been learned from past  mistakes in PFI. Most of those errors now date back a number of years, as the  junior Minister mentioned. Much has been learnt, and the level of expertise and knowledge is now greater. The  Committee for Finance and Personnel has heard a lot of evidence on  Workplace 2010. There are no certainties, but I take some reassurance from what  I have heard.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I note the comments made by Mitchel McLaughlin and Roy  Beggs about the ability of the private sector to wipe the eye of the public  sector. That is a serious concern, and it is right to say that the level of  expertise in the Civil Service has grown substantially. The support that SIB  has given has also been mentioned.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Roy Beggs mentioned the gateway review process, which  provides for ongoing scrutiny of major capital projects. It is of the utmost  importance, and the process must be fully observed in all cases. It can  identify warning signals at a stage when something can be done to address them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In summary, PFIs are with us for the moment. They are a  vehicle that may deliver value for money &mdash; but since most of the projects have  many years to run, that remains to be fully examined. Our main task is to  identify those projects that best lend themselves to PFI and then manage them  well. Once again, I thank all the Members who have contributed to this useful  and constructive debate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>

	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="5"></a>Adjournment</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Cancer Services in Foyle</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. &Eacute;ir&iacute;m le h&aacute;bhar  na d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireachta seo a mholadh, agus ba  mhaith liom mo bhu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis an Choiste Gn&oacute; as an deis seo a  thabhairt d&uacute;inn.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I was hoping to preface  my remarks by acknowledging the  presence of the Minister. I am sure that he is on his way.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  The business of the House has rolled forward slightly, I believe, but I am  assured that the Minister will be here very shortly.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  Does the Deputy Speaker wish to wait for a couple of minutes, or shall I  proceed?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: We should proceed.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  I accept that the Minister is on his way and  that the business of the House has run ahead &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brolly</strong>:  You have just wrecked your speech.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  I have just wrecked my speech is right, Francie.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to thank the  Business Committee for allowing the time for this debate. It is an  important subject, especially for those of us who live in the north-west,  because we are only too aware of the need for a comprehensive and dedicated  cancer facility in the region. That assessment is based on the opinion of those  who work in the Health Service and those who work with cancer patients. The  health experts have made the case for such a facility in the region, and the  arguments are overwhelming.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If we are to claim that we have a modern Health Service  that puts the needs of patients and the public first, a dedicated cancer  facility, with related services, is a must. Anything less, and we are failing  in our public responsibilities. In addition, hardly a week passes without the  human aspect of this situation reaching us, through personal contact or through  the media; stories of people having to travel the long distances to Belfast or Dublin  for tests, surgery and post-operative care.  However, one of the most damning aspects of this situation is people  saying that they often forgo treatment because of the physical and fiscal  demands of what is unnecessary travel. The Minister is aware of the lack of  facilities in the north-west and, to his credit, he has acknowledged that in  the Assembly and on a recent visit to Derry.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">This call, which is based on critical and objective  analysis, has wide support throughout the north-west. Last year, our party  presented the Department with a petition containing names that were gathered  from Dungiven to Omagh and from Derry City to Gaoth Dobhair in County Donegal.  A regional cancer facility is a key demand of the Stand Up for Derry campaign. It is  also one of the key issues identified by the Derry Well Woman Centre at  a recent conference in the city. The centre asked us for political support and  a commitment to lobby publicly for the provision of such a facility. This debate is part of that process.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The issue of a cancer facility in the north-west featured in the general election in the Twenty-six  Counties and prompted a number of mass rallies in Letterkenny. I wish to acknowledge the work of Padraig  MacLochlainn, a party colleague who has been at the forefront of the  campaign.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">This issue will not go away, because it is vital to the  health and well-being of thousands of people in the region. On its  establishment in 2004, the regional cancer services framework group had the aim  of:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;providing a cohesive structure for the provision of a  uniformly high standard of care.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">In order to achieve that uniformity, a high  standard of care must be provided in the north-west.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The cancer control programme acknowledges that  there should be a dedicated service in the north-west. It is contended that  such a facility requires a population base of 500,000 people. The north-west &mdash;  covering Derry, Tyrone, Donegal, Sligo,  Leitrim, Fermanagh and other counties &mdash; provides that critical mass. This issue has featured at the North/South Ministerial  Council, and the signals coming from  both Ministers are positive. That is welcome; however, the purpose of  this debate is not only to highlight the need for a dedicated facility and  related services, but also to ensure that we, as public representatives, fulfil  our task of keeping the issue on the agenda until it comes to fruition.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I now acknowledge the presence of the Minister in the  Assembly. In light of the media speculation of the past 24 hours, perhaps we  might hear some definite word about the future. The realisation of a cancer  facility in the north-west is something for which the Minister will need  support. I offer him that support on behalf of my party, and we will continue  in our efforts. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  I support the retention and expansion of any and all cancer services, not only  in Foyle but in the north-west in general. The services in Foyle draw their  patients from throughout the north-west and other regions. Therefore, the  services are also used daily by constituents of East   Londonderry.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Recently, there was speculation about the future of cancer  services at Altnagelvin   Hospital. When I asked the Health Minister for reassurance about those  services, he replied, to his credit, that the hospital&rsquo;s cancer unit will continue to provide a range of high-quality  compre&shy;hensive care and treatment  services. That was a welcome and well-received assurance from the  Minister to the people of my constituency of East   Londonderry.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that, in common with me, many other Members are  thankful that such services are available in Northern Ireland. Those services  must be supported unanimously by all  Assembly Members, because cancer does not discriminate between religious  or political differences. My only concern is  to ensure the continuation of the provision of cancer services in the  north-west of Northern    Ireland. There can never be a service that  suits everybody&rsquo;s needs and individual requirements. However, the  cancer-treatment centres and their excellent staff provide care in difficult  circumstances that saves and prolongs lives.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that the Minister appreciates that I will support  him in every proposal that he makes to ensure the provision of all cancer  services, from diagnosis to surgical intervention, and other treatments.  However, I ask him to be mindful that new developments are regularly being made  and that investment in those new treatments will, at times, be required. I ask  him to remember that the north-west deserves new treatments and investments as much as Belfast or any other region. Of  course, if the Minister overlooks the north-west for new treatments, he can be  sure that I will remind him of that requirement.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Foyle&rsquo;s cancer services are used far beyond the  geographical boundaries of that constituency. I want to ensure that the current  level of service is enhanced and developed in the months and years to come.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McClarty</strong>:  I congratulate the Member for Foyle Mr McCartney for bringing the motion before  the House. Everyone will be aware of the anguish and stress that cancer causes  those who suffer from the disease and, indeed, their families. Thankfully,  through the blessing of medical research and the dedication of healthcare  professionals, successful treatment of cancer is increasing in society.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The key to quality cancer care must surely be local  availability &mdash; at least, as local as possible &mdash; in view of the stresses and  strains that cancer can bring to all. Local care, rather than care that is  provided at a long distance, is crucial to reducing the physical and emotional  suffering and upheaval that people undergo.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members who represent areas of Northern   Ireland that are  outside greater Belfast can, at times, be left  with the impression that provision of key public services in Belfast is all that Northern Ireland requires. That is  simply not true; indeed, nothing could be further from the truth. The  constituency of East Londonderry, which I  am proud and privileged to represent, and my neigh&shy;bouring constituency  of Foyle, deserve the same access to world-class facilities as anywhere else in  Northern Ireland.  On that basis, I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s comments later in the debate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, the debate highlights why devolution is important  and why local politics, despite all its faults, can connect people for the  common good. Members from a range of parties are gathered in the Chamber to  debate the improvement of cancer services in Foyle and the surrounding areas.  The Assembly&rsquo;s ability to deliver for individuals and families who are  afflicted by the tragedy of cancer is of the greatest significance. I trust  that the Minister&rsquo;s comments will reflect that.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  First, I thank the Minister for his attendance and patience at the meeting that  he facilitated in Derry last week, which I had requested on behalf of Derry  Well Woman and the cross-border Action Cancer group to discuss cancer services  in Foyle. I was heartened and pleased to hear that he has already been working  hard on the north-west&rsquo;s cancer-care agenda.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister heard at first hand last week that Derry Well  Woman and its cross-border cancer-care group have  carried out Trojan work. It is to that group&rsquo;s credit that the issue has  been kept in the public eye, and to the forefront of decision-makers&rsquo; minds and  diaries.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I feel a sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu &mdash; I am sure the Minister does,  too &mdash; because we covered this ground less than a week ago. However, the issue  is such that it is worth reiterating at any given opportunity.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Cross-border cancer services have been at the top of my  political and general wish list for some time now. Unfortunately, cancer is a  reality for an ever-increasing number of people in Northern Ireland, particularly in  the north-west. Approximately 1,300 people in the north-west will be diagnosed  with cancer this year, and approximately 2,500 people will be treated annually.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is essential that we politicians work to the best of our  capabilities to deliver an efficient and supportive service for patients and  their families. I appreciate that there is a state-of-the-art cancer facility  at Belfast City Hospital. However, a strong, interdependent need exists  for a similar facility in the north-west to  service the many hundreds of people  who make daily journeys to Belfast,  often in an emotionally and physically fragile state.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Cancer treatment is often rigorous and physically  debilitating, and is made even more difficult by having to travel for hours to  reach the point of treatment. The site at Belfast City   Hospital will reach  saturation point in 2015, so a new site must be up and running before that  date.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I ask the Minister  again to consider the plight of many people in the north-west. I  appreciate the groundwork that he and his  Department have already done in assessing how feasible it is that we  have a second dedicated cancer unit in Northern Ireland, and I am confident  that he will make his decision sooner rather than later. In conjunction with  his counterpart in the South, Mary Harney, I am confident that he will deliver  a service that will be beneficial and accessible to people in the north-west,  on both the Northern and Southern sides of the border. I promise the Minister  that I will give him all the support that I can.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Deeny</strong>: I am delighted to participate in the debate. I support Mr  McCartney on the matter and thank him for tabling the Adjournment topic. A  dedicated cancer service is needed at Altnagelvin Area   Hospital to look after  people in the west and north-west.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Cancer is a devastating disease. I have had to tell people  &mdash; some younger than me &mdash; that they have cancer. Such news is tough for  individuals to receive, and people often take a long time to accept it. When those people then must make excessively long  journeys for all sorts of tests and investigations, their levels of distress increase. Indeed, such long journeys  affect their mental health and, in turn, worsen the physical disease.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am delighted that the Minister is present. Political  representatives, as well as the medical profession, must strive to bring  services to people rather than to expect people to travel to avail themselves  of those services. That is never more relevant than when the patients concerned  are suffering from a life-threatening illness such as cancer.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am originally from the east of the Province but have  lived in the west for the past 22 years. As Mr McClarty said, we must move away  from the Belfast-only mentality. The Minister has indicated that that will  happen. Not before time, because patients who suffer from cancer have had to,  and continue to have to, travel to Belfast  regularly. Some of those people have since passed on, among them my  mother-in-law. Often it can take an entire day to travel to and from Belfast, and transport  must be arranged. It is totally unacceptable that seriously ill people are  forced to make such long journeys to Belfast  for a 10-minute appointment, or a five-minute blood test.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must press the issue. Altnagelvin  Area Hospital  in Derry  should be the main provider of cancer treatment in that area. I ask the  Minister to look to the future and to having Altnagelvin as the north-west  provider of cancer treatment. Other services should also be made more local.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For example, I hope that many of the blood tests and  investigations will be carried out in the new primary-care centres. Speaking as  a doctor, there is no reason why fit and healthy doctors and nurses cannot  travel to outpatient clinics in Omagh and Enniskillen or why they could not  carry out tests in the future primary-care centres.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I support Mr McCartney&rsquo;s arguments. He mentioned that we  need a population base of 500,000 people to justify a cancer centre; the last  time I checked there were only 410,000 people west of the Bann. However, my  figures refer only to the Six Counties, and taking into account the other  counties that he mentioned would give us the required population base.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is only fair that the services be provided. No one knows  who will be diagnosed with that terrible disease next. As elected  representatives and as professionals, we should not add to patients&rsquo; distress  and misery by forcing them to endure unnecessary journeys to receive treatment  and investigations.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. I thank my colleague Raymond McCartney for securing this adjournment debate. Although everyone can  understand the merits of the Belfast City Hospital Cancer Centre as a centre of excellence at the leading edge of  treatment and care, surely there is  no reason why cancer treatment and care services cannot be provided  locally at either Altnagelvin Hospital or Letterkenny General Hospital.  It is intolerable that local cancer patients must undergo long journeys and prolonged stays far from their  homes when either of those hospitals could easily house an oncology unit  that would meet the present demand for the full range of cancer services in the  north-west. Unfortunately, that demand is projected to grow in years to come.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Many people perceive that, for too long, healthcare has  been considered to be a tradable commodity that ignores the loop between  patients and the conditions in which they are treated. In securing treatment,  we can no longer afford to ignore patients&rsquo; personal travel conditions as  something beyond the overall monetary cost of healthcare provision. Social cost  cannot be ignored if we are to provide adequate standards of healthcare across  the island.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Given the prevalence of all forms of cancers in the  north-west and the fact that it has the highest cancer mortality rates in the western world, the local provision of  oncology services should be a priority for everyone. Some form of new  all-Ireland configuration &mdash; as suggested this week by Sinn F&eacute;in in its meetings  with Health Ministers, North and South &mdash; would justify an oncology unit for the  entire north-west, serving both west Ulster and north Connaught, instead of  very ill patients from this region being forced to undergo the additional burden of repeated, prolonged journeys  to the only existing units in  Belfast, Dublin, Cork and Galway.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The argument for a dedicated regional centre in the  north-west has been underscored by new research, which reveals that a person is  more likely to die from cancer in Derry than  anywhere else in the North. According to a new report from the North&rsquo;s Cancer  Registry, Derry has higher than expected  levels of cancer cases and deaths. In fact, the region has the highest  incidence of lung cancer in the Six Counties. The report concludes that that is  likely to be linked to the higher levels of deprivation in the area and the  associated high levels of tobacco usage.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The provision of cancer  services is one of the five key demands  in the Stand Up for Derry campaign. Thousands  of people have signed the petition supporting that campaign. Everyone from the  city knows someone who has had to travel daily, in the depth of winter, from  Derry to Belfast  for cancer treatment. They must travel when they are at their lowest ebb. At  times, they must queue for treatment and recover enough to make the journey  home&mdash; a journey of between 75 and 100 miles for those who live outside Derry. I am sure that the Minister would not want his  partner, sister, brother or child to endure that. That intolerable situation  must be addressed urgently.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, financial assistance and recognition should be  given to community groups such as the Pink Ladies and the Derry Well Woman,  which support and comfort patients who are treated so appallingly by the health  system. It is appalling that cancer patients are faced with the additional  trauma of travelling so far to access cancer services.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If the political will  exists in the Administrations, North and  South, the provision in the Good Friday Agreement for seamless healthcare means that no constraints  should stand in the way of a regional cancer facility in the north west. I ask the  Minister to support this demand and provide the healthcare service that is  desperately required. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  I thank Raymond McCartney for proposing the topic for the Adjournment debate,  and I acknowledge the Minister&rsquo;s hard work, determination and responsiveness  since taking up office.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As Dr Deeny said, telling someone that he or she has cancer  is no joke and must be a difficult task. We can all relate to cancer &mdash; family  members, neighbours and so forth.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There was a young mother of four from Derry  &mdash; I will call her Margaret &mdash; who was terminally ill with cancer and required  palliative radiation treatment. She was fortunate to be able to get that  treatment because it increased her comfort and allowed her time with her  family. Unfortunately, she had to travel to Belfast to receive it. That meant that, in  the last few weeks of her life, her husband had to leave their children with  relatives while he made the journey to visit her. That took a terrible toll on  him, their children and their family. Margaret&rsquo;s case is similar to that of so  many people in Derry  and the north-west. It happens regularly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Similarly, people in Donegal must travel to Belfast and Dublin  for treatment. Poor health and economic disadvantage go hand in hand, and,  therefore, it is not surprising &mdash; as other Members remarked &mdash; that the north-west of Ireland has the highest occurrence  of cancer on this island. In fact, last year, as Mary Bradley said, around 1,300 cases of cancer were diagnosed at Altna&shy;gelvin  Hospital, which indicates the scale of the  problem.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The border cuts off the  natural hinterland of Donegal, which artificially reduces the population  and leaves Donegal without a city and  accompanying public services. That disadvantages everyone. Together, Derry and Donegal have the critical population mass that  is not present when segregated by the border. Partnership is the answer to that  segregation, and it is good that a range of ongoing projects integrate services  across the north-west region for the benefit of all.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, major  opportunities exist for the Minister, working with his counterparts in Dublin, to provide an  enhanced range of treatments in the north-west. The Minister met a delegation  from the north-west, led by my party colleague Mary Bradley, and that meeting was positive and productive. The Minister gave  positive signals that a good business case is being prepared for a  radiation unit to be located in the north-west, in particular, at Altnagelvin.  We anticipate good news on that front today, making cancer services available  to the whole population.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I assure the Minister that such a development will be  strongly supported in the north-west. That service will add to the existing cancer provision at Altnagelvin,  providing desperately needed treatment and reducing the pressure on the Belfast cancer service.  The range of cancer services at Altnagelvin Hospital is not extensive;  however a high level of expertise provides a good basis for growth. It is  important to develop a major cancer centre of excellence in the north west, without compromising the quality of treatment  for patients in the north-west or across the network of hospitals in Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP congratulates the Minister on his work thus far  and urges him, in partnership with his counter&shy;parts in Dublin, to remain focused on the development  of health services in the north-west, to supply the range of facilities that  one would expect in a modern society, and to enable access to them.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brolly</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I congratulate Raymond McCartney  on securing the Adjournment debate and bringing a matter of great importance to  the people of the north-west to the notice of the House. People who have cancer  are already demoralised by all that it entails, as are their families and  everyone around them. The last thing that they  need is to have to travel by bus from Derry to Belfast for treatment. Often, that  deepens their demoralisation to such an extent that they almost want to give  up, which is the last thing that any patient should do.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When I was a young boy in years gone by, people did not  talk about cancer. It was a rare and inevitably fatal illness, and the care of  cancer patients amounted to no more than providing pain relief. Those who used  the term &ldquo;cancer&rdquo; at all whispered it, and people where I come from called it  the &ldquo;bad thing&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Nowadays, cancer is,  relatively speaking, an epidemic. People use the word &ldquo;cancer&rdquo;, and they  talk freely about who has cancer and from what type they are suffering.  However, the fear and family heartbreak caused by cancer remains the same.  People are crying out for research to find a great answer to end the terrible  scourge that cancer has become.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the meantime, and until some way of halting the disease  can be found, the care that is now available must be made accessible to  everyone. However, as I mentioned, such care is not accessible to people in the  north-west, but it should be, and within range. The community in the north-west  generally earns low wages, and some may never have had the opportunity to travel far from home. Some people do not understand  that, but the community in the north-west consists of ordinary people. They are  happy to go as far as Derry, but travelling to the big city of Belfast and having to wait to be seen in its large hospitals is a strange experience  for them. As they experience such terrible times, their minds are constantly  plagued by worry and fear, and their bodies are racked with pain.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is the job of Members  who represent the north-west to secure cancer services at Altnagelvin Area Hospital,  and we must ensure that that happens soon. I am aware of media speculation that  the Minister is about to make an  announcement about Altnagelvin. The only announce&shy;ment that MLAs from  the area want to hear is of a dedicated,  comprehensive cancer facility at Altnagelvin Area Hospital for people in the north-west.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank everyone who supports that objective, and I am grateful to Members from the north-west,  particularly from my East Derry  constituency, who stayed on today to drive it forward. Their presence  demonstrates to the Minister the seriousness with which we regard the matter,  and I hope that he has listened. The Stand Up for Derry campaign highlighted  the issue, and I ask every Member, particularly the Minister, to stand up for  the cancer facility at Altnagelvin   Area Hospital.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: I thank Raymond  McCartney for the opportunity to debate this important issue. As Members know,  cancer is a leading cause of death in Northern Ireland. Every year,  cancer causes 3,600 deaths and approximately 8,500 new cases are diagnosed. Northern Ireland  has an ageing population, and, as people live longer, their chances of  developing cancer increase.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is possible that, by 2025, cancer levels will have  increased by over 50%, with 13,000 new cancers being diagnosed each year. Those  who do not develop the disease will, almost certainly, have a family member or  close friend who will be affected by cancer. Cancer is a real concern for  everyone, and it will have an impact on all our lives. To control and fight  cancer represents a huge challenge, and our efforts must be equal to it.  Therefore, I remain committed to ensuring the highest possible standard of  cancer services in the north-west and throughout Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Dr Henrietta Campbell&rsquo;s report &lsquo;Cancer Services &ndash; Investing  for the Future&rsquo; was important in identifying shortcomings and instigating the  necessary reforms to bring cancer services in Northern Ireland up to the  standard expected of a modern, high-quality health and social care service.  That report recommended the establishment of a single regional cancer centre of  excellence and four cancer units, each of which should be linked with a larger  acute hospital. Those reforms are now in place, and we have a state-of-the-art  regional cancer centre in Belfast, at a cost of  &pound;70 million, which is recognised as one of the best of its type in Europe. There are also four subregional cancer units at Altnagelvin Hospital,  Antrim Area  Hospital, Craigavon  Area Hospital  and the Ulster Hospital.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The cancer unit at Altnagelvin Hospital was established in 1999  and provides a wide range of cancer services to the population of the  north-west, including services that are  aimed at early detection and screening, imaging, surgery, and chemotherapy. Pathology services to support cancer care are provided from a superb laboratory  facility at Altnagelvin, which opened last year and which cost &pound;18 million. In December 2007, I announced that  services there would continue  unchanged, following the findings of the latest review of pathology  services. For nearly a decade, the cancer unit at Altnagelvin Hospital  has provided to the local community the full range of treatments and therapies  for more common cancers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The management of the treatment of children with cancer  from the area is another matter of concern. Evidence suggests that children  with cancer do better when they are treated  at a regional centre, where expertise in that specialty can be developed  and maintained at a high level. I know that parents of sick children always  want the best possible care for their child and there will always be a need for  some children to travel to the regional  centre for treatment. However, I want to ensure that the routine  elements of children&rsquo;s treatment can be &mdash; and are &mdash; delivered locally.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Altnagelvin Hospital has been doing well in working to achieve  the highest standards of safety and quality. The Western Health and Social Care  Trust is on target to meet the new access standards for patients with suspected  cancer. Those standards state that, by March 2008,  98% of patients diagnosed with cancer will begin treatment within a  maximum of 31 days from the date of their diagnosis, and 75% of patients with  suspected cancer who have been referred urgently by a GP will begin their first  definitive treatment within a maximum of 62  days. In addition, latest figures indicate that women who are referred to Altnagelvin Hospital  for a specialist assessment for breast cancer are all seen within the two-week target. Therefore, it is important to be  mindful of the considerable range of cancer services that are already  available in Foyle, and which are delivering real benefits to patients.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">All radiotherapy services in Northern Ireland are located at the  Northern Ireland Cancer Centre, and there are sound clinical reasons for that.  The centre was planned and built to meet the radiotherapy needs of the  population of Northern until 2015. However, the time has come to plan the scale and location of provision beyond  that date. An initial assessment of projected cancer incidence and demographics  suggests that a combination of radiotherapy services in Belfast  and Altnagelvin would best meet the needs of  the population of Northern    Ireland beyond 2015. That would ensure that  90% of the population is within one hour&rsquo;s travel of radiotherapy treatment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have discussed that issue with a range of public representatives and community groups from the  north-west. As Mrs Bradley mentioned, I met her last Wednesday, along  with representatives of Derry Well Woman, Co-operating for Cancer Care North  West and clinicians from both sides of the border, and I acknow&shy;ledge the  excellent work that those groups do in supporting people who are affected by  cancer.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The possibility of locating additional radiotherapy capacity at Altnagelvin Hospital  raises another opportunity for consideration, and that is the potential  for cross-border co-operation in the  development of that resource. Last November, I discussed the issue of  radiotherapy services in the north-west with the South&rsquo;s Minister for Health  and Children at the North/South Ministerial Council health and food-safety  sectoral meeting, which was held in Dublin.  We agreed that our Departments should assess the potential for co-operation on  that specialty.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I want the planning process to be informed by the  continuing discussions between our Departments, and that will be the case.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Taking all of those issues into account, and after careful  consideration of my Department&rsquo;s assessment of the optimum location for  additional radiotherapy provision, I am pleased to announce that the new  satellite radiotherapy centre will be established at Altnagelvin Hospital.  I have instructed the health boards and the Western Health and Social Care  Trust to develop a business case for that development as a matter of urgency so  that the new centre will be up and running by 2015. I expect to have a  timetable for the delivery of that project by June 2008.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When planning a public investment on such a scale, it is  important to get it right. Any new development must provide sufficient capacity and supply high-quality services  and standards. We also must ensure that the tendering  and procurement processes demonstrate value for money and comply with EU and national legislation. Inevitably, that will take time, but it is  necessary in order to ensure that we have the right services in the  right place with the right mix of skilled  staff to provide them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My first commitment is, and always will be, to ensure that  sufficient radiotherapy capacity exists to treat  the people of Northern    Ireland in the most effective, safe and efficient manner. However, I am keen to  ensure that any mutual benefits that  can be gained from cross-border co-operation are fully exploited.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Today&rsquo;s announcement will mean that, by providing  radiotherapy services in Belfast and  Londonderry, the needs of the population of Northern Ireland will be met beyond  2015. That is proof of my commitment to providing high-quality and accessible  cancer services to the entire population.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will continue to ensure that all health and social care  services are provided to the highest possible standards on a fair and equitable  basis throughout Northern    Ireland.</p>
