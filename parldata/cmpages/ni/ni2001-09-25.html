                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. It is
                customary for a copy of a Minister’s statement to be available
                to Members on arrival at the Chamber. Unfortunately, Mr Durkan’s
                statement has not been made available to Members at this point

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It arrived at a very late stage. The
                statement has not been made available to some Members in the
                Chamber, and I ask that the matter be taken up with the Business
                Office to ensure that this does not happen again.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Tierney:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. The
                normal procedure is for the statement to be left at the Door for
                Members, which is exactly what happened today.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Finance and Personnel (Mr
                Durkan):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With permission, Mr Deputy Speaker, I would
                like to make a statement on the Executive’s public spending
                plans for 2002-03. I understand that the statement has been put
                in Members’ pigeonholes and that it is available outside the
                Chamber. I do not know exactly when it was left outside, but I
                shall follow up the matter given the understandable concern that
                has been expressed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In accordance with paragraph 20 of strand one
                of the Belfast Agreement, the Executive agreed a draft Programme
                for Government, which incorporated an agreed Budget at its
                meeting on 20 September. In line with section 64 of the Northern
                Ireland Act 1998, I today lay the Budget before the Assembly for
                scrutiny and approval, after examination and debate in Committee
                and in the Chamber.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to emphasise that the proposals that I
                announce today are made on behalf of the Executive as a whole.
                Following intense and serious discussions we have drawn together
                spending plans for all our services. Each Minister who attended
                the Executive has participated in thoughtful and constructive
                discussion on the public services that we oversee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are aware of the pressures that affect all
                Departments. We have a shared responsibility for the judgements
                that we have formed on the balance between competing demands and
                priorities. Therefore we must share the credit, and be prepared
                to share the criticism, from the implications of our plans.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All Ministers must deal with their own
                issues. They work within plans set by the Executive, and they
                should receive our support as they uphold and implement what we
                have agreed. I am grateful for assurances from those Ministers
                who have engaged in the discussions that they will uphold the
                conclusions reached. The clarity of the agreement that we have
                reached shows what can be achieved in our unique form of
                multiparty Administration.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have also had useful bilateral talks with
                the Minister for Regional Development and the Minister for
                Social Development, who have both indicated their support for
                some of the proposals I present today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My main purpose is to begin the important
                stage of consultation on the spending plans for next year. In
                response to the Committee for Finance and Personnel’s report
                from last December, the Executive have fulfilled their
                commitment to bring forward Budget proposals immediately after
                the summer recess. That is in order to maximise the opportunity
                for the Assembly to fulfil its scrutiny role, as envisaged in
                the Belfast Agreement and in section 64 of the Northern Ireland
                Act 1998.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When I presented the position report to the
                Assembly on 19 June 2001 on behalf of the Executive, I made it
                clear that the report was evidence of the Executive’s
                commitment to engage in meaningful consultation and to provide
                an opportunity for debate and comment in the Assembly and more
                widely on the issues. Many have availed themselves of the
                opportunity, and I am grateful to the Committee for Finance and
                Personnel for the attention they have paid to this issue. The
                Committee’s commentary on the position report has been
                helpful, and there has been extensive commentary from other
                Committees. Beyond the Assembly, we have received many important
                comments from social partner organisations and from other
                interested parties. I am grateful for the thoughtful input that
                they have provided.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The spending plans that I shall outline have
                been designed to deliver the priorities and actions in the
                revised Programme for Government, which was presented to the
                Assembly yesterday by Sir Reg Empey and Séamus Mallon. The
                Programme for Government has set the context for our budgetary
                decisions. The draft Budget’s development has been influenced
                by the Executive’s proposals on our policy priorities and
                programmes that are set out in the draft Programme for
                Government. This year we have further strengthened the link
                between policy making and financial planning, which ensures that
                our policies drive our expenditure and not vice versa.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have been able to confirm and refine our
                actions and targets, as explained in the statement on the
                Programme for Government. In a few cases, due to prevailing
                constraints and other pressures, it has been necessary to defer
                planned actions. The Executive have agreed that if the resource
                position improves, first consideration will be given to
                fulfilling Programme for Government commitments that have been
                deferred.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The draft Budget covers the second year of
                the period covered by the 2000 spending review. From the longer-
                term perspective, since the comprehensive spending review in
                1998 there has been a period of rapid growth in public spending.
                Our departmental expenditure limit allocation, as set by the
                Treasury, shows a rise in public expenditure in 2002-03 of
                5·8%, or around 3% more than general inflation. However, I
                recognise that many of the costs that affect public services are
                rising at a faster rate than general inflation. The allocations
                for 2002-03 build on the 5·5% real terms increase in 2001-02,
                which has allowed Departments to initiate the work started on
                the Programme for Government priorities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important to stress that we cannot
                expect spending to continue to rise at such a substantial rate
                for much longer. Objectively and against the historic trend, the
                public spending context, at least in the context of the Barnett
                formula, is now &quot;as good as it gets&quot;.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given the problems faced by many public
                services, we can conclude that the rapid growth is necessary but
                that it falls short in that it does not match expectations for
                the delivery of services. That applies, in particular, to health
                spending, in regard to which it is increasingly clear that even
                the high rates of increase applied in England, which we cannot
                afford to match, leave serious needs unmet. As a result of the
                demand for public services, substantial bids have been made by
                Departments. Those needs are real and they need to be addressed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Barnett formula dominates the overall
                arrangements for determining public spending levels for our
                services. As there was no spending review in Whitehall this
                year, there are no new Barnett consequentials for 2002-03, other
                than the small amounts added in the Chancellor’s Budget in
                March. The Barnett formula results in less growth of our
                spending power than England’s, and that is apparent in issues
                that we have had to address in preparing the draft Budget.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive remain determined to seek
                improvements to our position with regard to the Barnett formula.
                We need to seek change to help us seize the unique opportunities
                provided by devolution and the Good Friday Agreement. We must
                also address the backlog of underinvestment in infrastructure
                and the difficulties in funding for health, education, transport
                and other services that we have inherited; equivalent services
                in England are now being addressed with large amounts of money.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, we must not overlook the most
                obvious point: the amount spent per person in Northern Ireland
                is much higher than in England. We need to recognise that the
                Treasury will point out areas in which our spending is high and
                that it will argue that we must reprioritise. I feel strongly
                that we must reprioritise in response to our own views and
                values, not in response to Treasury constraints. That is what
                the Programme for Government and the Budget are all about.
                However, we must be aware of the areas in which relatively high
                spending weakens our case for help with our most acute
                difficulties.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Proportionately, we raise much less revenue
                than in England, and we fund water and sewerage services from
                our departmental expenditure limit. The Assembly should note
                that if we were to raise rate revenue and water charges roughly
                to their equivalent pattern in England, we would have
                approximately £300 million of additional spending power for
                public services. Even if we make allowance for the greater level
                of social deprivation in Northern Ireland, our low rate revenue
                still makes it difficult to argue for additional money from the
                Treasury.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In last year’s spending review we set
                indicative figures for 2002-03 and 2003-04 that showed how the
                money might be allocated to services, subject to review this
                year. That accounted for all our spending power, except for the
                Executive programme funds.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In approaching the Budget, the Executive
                could simply have confirmed the indicative allocations set last
                year. We could have allocated the additional £19·3 million
                available from the Chancellor’s March Budget, and the £23·5
                million available as a result of reduced requirements of
                Departments, which was derived mainly from additional receipts
                and further expected proceeds from the sale of Housing Executive
                property. That would have meant that the majority of the bids
                lodged by Departments, and summarised in the position report,
                would have been ruled out. Departments would have had to
                readjust priorities to cover new costs and forgo the
                developments implied by their other bids.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.45 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, we have looked at the more general
                needs and demands that services face and at the scope for better
                use of the available spending power. We looked seriously at the
                option of some redistribution within the indicative figures that
                had been set last year. Although, in the final package of
                proposals, only one Department receives less than the previous
                indicative allocations, we did consider the possibility of wider
                reallocations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also took careful note of the points that
                have been made about the levels of reallocation that have
                applied in all our monitoring rounds so far, and the high levels
                of end of year flexibility. We are aware that if the balance of
                loading between programmes is not right at the start of the
                year, that will exacerbate the problem of underspending.
                Moreover, it is more difficult to explain the need to raise
                money from the rates if that money is not being fully drawn down
                by our programmes. It would seem odd for the scope and extent of
                our changes in a full Budget round to be on a smaller scale than
                most monitoring rounds.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In considering those issues, we came to the
                view that health, education and roads were among the services
                that face the most acute difficulties, and they would have to be
                given a degree of priority. That does not give those functions
                pre-eminence in the Programme for Government, but simply
                recognises that, in the context of the draft Budget, they
                presented the most clear-cut cases for some increase in the
                indicative figures that we had determined last year. The key
                difficulty was to find ways to address those priorities without
                simply shifting the difficulty to another sector.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We cannot allocate resources beyond our
                departmental expenditure limit, but we can look at the prospects
                for future room to manoeuvre. We have concluded that we can,
                without undue risk, allocate around £48 million of spending
                power to be carried forward into 2002-03, based on anticipated
                underspending this year. We are confident that it will be
                possible to manage resources in the next few monitoring rounds
                and through 2002-03, and to make good that assumption.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a last resort, we have agreed that if the
                pattern changes and we have insufficient underspend to confirm
                the assumptions that we make today, we could draw on the
                provision held in the Executive programme funds. That means that
                we have a firm basis for additional allocations now, because the
                Executive programme funds provide security against the risks
                that affect our decisions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, neither the infrastructure fund nor
                the children’s fund will be included in that arrangement. We
                want to give particular priority to addressing the region’s
                strategic infrastructure, and it is important that we have the
                Executive programme funds available to fund more long-term
                developments, such as those announced last Friday and yesterday.
                We also want to protect the children’s fund because, as well
                as being intrinsically important, it is about to be the subject
                of a major consultation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To use the £48 million in that way is not a
                cost-free option; it puts some limits on our scope to meet the
                pressures that may arise this year. However, I am confident that
                we have acted to manage resources as effectively as possible at
                the draft Budget stage by reducing the extent of reallocation
                necessary in monitoring rounds.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To use the £48 million and the additional
                money from the March Budget, and by recycling the reduced
                requirements from Departments, the total available for
                allocation is £92·6 million. That also includes a small
                reduction — £1·8 million — from the indicative allocation
                for the Department for Social Development. Of that, £13 million
                is required to deal with our proposed approach to the regional
                rate for 2002-03.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore, the approach that I have described
                allowed us to meet a total of £79·6 million of the spending
                pressures in 2002-03 over and above the indicative figures. That
                is a much better scenario than had seemed likely in June, when
                the position report was published. However, all Departments will
                still have to act to absorb substantial additional costs that
                cannot be covered by additional spending power. That is not
                surprising or exceptional, but the norm for the management of
                public spending.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In reaching our decisions, the Executive
                examined a number of possible means to secure additional
                spending power. We focused on the need to control the level of
                spending on departmental running costs. All Departments will be
                required to examine how they can reprioritise to ensure that
                spending is focused where it is most needed — on public
                services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to recognise that spending on
                departmental running costs includes some services provided
                directly by Departments. Therefore, an across-the-board cut in
                departmental running costs would be unhelpful. We also need to
                ensure that Departments can address the Assembly’s needs, give
                proper account to its Committees and meet their obligations
                under the agreement. The Executive will consider the issue
                further before the revised Budget is prepared.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We shall also continue to examine the scope
                for additional asset sales or other measures that would allow us
                to release more resources for services. We shall seek further
                information from Departments on that, and it would be helpful if
                all Committees would include examination of the issue in their
                discussions with Departments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The draft Budget is not so much about
                increases to plans, but about how best to use the resources
                available. It is not about ordering up more, but about getting
                our priorities in order. That applies to the full range of
                services and also to each Department’s programme. We should
                not focus on bids for more, but on how we can get more from what
                we have. There are no free choices, but we can make real choices
                based on the values and principles that we wish to uphold.
                Making a difference does not depend only on having more money to
                spend. We can and should break further away from the patterns
                that we have inherited.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have to be prepared for some allocations
                to go down as well as up. To get the most from public spending
                will mean that there is more to the process than sharing out
                additional money. We must focus more on what is being achieved
                and delivered. As we develop the public service agreements, as
                published in the draft Programme for Government yesterday, the
                outputs and outcomes can and must come to mean more to us than
                the amounts of money or the percentage increases in spending on
                programmes. That was what we wanted to achieve in the Government
                Resources and Accounts Act (Northern Ireland) 2001, and we need
                to ask Departments to engage in that with increasing realism.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I urge all the Committees to focus their
                attention not so much on what may have happened to bids that
                Departments lodged, but on what will be achieved through the
                Departments’ programmes. We need to work on the money that is
                there — as in the Executive’s proposals — and not on the
                money that we cannot allocate. It may be helpful in some cases
                for Committees to follow through with scrutiny of areas that
                have been questioned in the Public Accounts Committee’s
                hearings and reports, so that the spending plans can benefit
                from the detailed work already completed by that Committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In making choices, we need to focus spending
                on where the best advantage can be gained, or on where the needs
                are most acute. That means facing up to the fact that some
                spending is less essential and less beneficial. Benefits and
                effects can be indirect and long term, and, at times, we need to
                insist on resources being secured for long-term investment, even
                at the cost of short-term convenience.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must focus on the evidence and make better
                informed decisions on the allocations for each Department for
                the benefit of the community and without regard for the party
                identity of the Minister concerned. It is important that that is
                seen by all as the dominant issue for consideration by the
                Assembly. Prioritisation will be the theme of the work that
                needs to be done between now and December.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In finalising the draft Budget proposals, the
                Executive have considered the views expressed by the Assembly on
                a range of issues. The Executive propose that the additional
                resources available should be used as explained in the Budget
                document and in the table attached to my statement. To outline
                the picture of the Executive’s Budget proposals, I will
                comment on the position for each Department in turn and set out
                briefly the changes to the indicative allocations that the
                Executive agreed last December.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive programme funds are a key
                element of the Executive’s determination to ensure that
                spending plans are adjusted from previous patterns and spent in
                line with the Executive’s strategic priorities as is set out
                in the Programme for Government. They are also designed to
                promote cross-cutting working, in which proposals and
                initiatives can be proposed for consideration by an appropriate
                group of Ministers working together.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We believe that the special allocations from
                the funds managed and approved at Executive level will make a
                real difference from previous patterns of expenditure. Because
                some spending power has been placed in those new funds, it
                follows that the amounts shown for Departments in the draft
                Budget will understate the final spending power that will be
                available to functions in due course. I ask the Committees to
                bear that in mind when considering the proposals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Negotiations on the new round of structural
                funds have now been completed for the Peace II and building
                sustainable prosperity programmes, and for the equal community
                initiative. The negotiations for the remaining community
                initiatives — INTERREG., URBAN and LEADER — are nearing
                completion. The detailed arrangements required under the
                programmes are nearly ready, and it is expected that bids for
                funding will be invited across the range of measures in the near
                future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The allocations to functions and Departments
                in the Budget reflect the Departments’ responsibilities as
                implementing and accountable bodies for measures within the
                various structural funds operational programmes. The figures in
                the summary and the departmental tables illustrate the scope of
                the new programmes and how they complement the Executive’s own
                programmes. That helps to highlight the special contribution
                made to the region by European programmes, especially the unique
                assistance from the EU programme for peace and reconciliation.
                It is proposed that the new Executive programme fund for social
                inclusion and community regeneration will be managed alongside
                elements of the structural funds, and the community initiatives
                in particular, to maximise co-operation between the Executive,
                district councils and the European Union.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will now turn to the main features of the
                departmental allocations. The allocation proposed for the
                Department of Agriculture and Rural Development is some £204
                million. Following the foot-and-mouth disease crisis, the
                Executive wish to see how best to secure the future of the rural
                economy and the communities that depend on it. In particular, we
                will, over the coming months, examine the conclusions of the
                rural visioning exercise.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The allocation for 2002-03 includes an
                additional £2·2 million for a greatly enhanced programme of
                BSE testing of animals to meet EU requirements. That is in line
                with the Executive’s priority to attain a low BSE incidence
                status so that our farmers can regain access to export markets.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.00 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further provision has been made available to
                take forward the scrapie eradication programme, and provision
                for animal disease compensation is being aligned more accurately
                with need. Funding has been made available to maintain the beef
                quality initiative and take forward the Agenda 2000 reforms and
                the cod recovery plan. The Budget also provides for an increase
                of £300,000 in support of the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish
                Lights Commission — one of the North/South implementation
                bodies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure
                faces some cost pressures in respect of museums and in
                completing the establishment of the Department with its
                particular and distinctive role. The proposals include a
                significant boost in expenditure compared to 2001-02, especially
                for museums and libraries. The plans also provide appropriate
                provision for the operational costs of the languages body and
                Waterways Ireland. The proposed allocations will also cover the
                cost of the staffing necessary to allow the Department of
                Culture, Arts and Leisure to meet its wide-ranging portfolio of
                responsibilities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Budget proposals for the Department of
                Education support the Executive’s priority of investing in
                education and skills. Planned allocations will promote a
                substantial programme of support for the school sector, the
                youth service and community relations activities. That
                represents a significant improvement on the indicative plans
                announced last December, although the proposals will still call
                for a careful prioritisation of activities in the education
                programme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Budget plans will enable the Department
                to continue the drive to improve standards and promote
                excellence across the whole of the school sector, to achieve
                targets on GCSE and A level attainment levels and literacy and
                numeracy levels, and to reduce the number of pupils identified
                as poor attendees. The resources provided will protect classroom
                provision and initiatives that are key to assisting vulnerable
                groups.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Resources are included for ongoing
                initiatives to improve schools that are underperforming and to
                provide all schools with information and communication
                facilities that will increase access to new learning
                opportunities and learning materials.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Budget proposals for the Department of
                Enterprise, Trade and Investment represent a slight decrease in
                spending compared with this year. The amounts required for
                support to industry and enterprise are difficult to predict at
                the budgetary planning stage, and those allocated for 2002-03
                reflect the recent trend while taking account of evolving
                policies in lower grant rates and alternative types of support.
                The Executive remain sensitive to the possible need for
                significant investment, should some particular need or
                opportunity arise.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not yet clear what effect the expected
                economic slowdown will have, and it is intended that the
                Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment will keep the
                matter under review and report at the earliest opportunity
                should changing circumstances reduce the budget needed in
                2002-03. In setting this allocation, the Executive remain
                confident that the Department will still be able to meet its
                main Programme for Government priorities and public service
                agreement targets.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also important to note that the Budget
                provision does not take into account possible major
                infrastructure projects such as the recently announced natural
                gas pipelines and the provision of broadband telecommunications
                in Northern Ireland. Those will fall to be considered for
                support from the Executive programme funds. It is expected that
                the grant for the gas pipelines will come mainly from the
                Budgets for 2003-04 to 2005-06, so it is not a matter for the
                Budget for 2002-03.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The budget for the Department of Finance and
                Personnel will support the Executive’s drive to provide modern
                and efficient public services. The resources provided will
                enable the Department to provide advice and assistance to the
                Executive and the Assembly, helping them to manage the public
                expenditure system and decide how to allocate scarce resources
                adequately to finance Northern Ireland’s public services. The
                Department will also provide a range of central services to
                other Departments and complete major reviews of rating policy;
                public procurement policies; the arrangements for promotion and
                recruitment to the Senior Civil Service; accommodation policy;
                and the scope for the decentralisation of Civil Service jobs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department for Employment and Learning’s
                allocation will enable the planned expansion of student support
                schemes to continue and allow the delivery of other higher and
                further education services to be maintained at current levels.
                Changing needs and patterns of demand have led to a planned
                reduction in employment programmes, but levels of service to
                individuals will be secured. The additions made will support the
                Programme for Government priority of investing in education and
                skills and its supporting actions to broaden access to higher
                and further education and employment opportunities. An extra
                £30·4 million is included in the Budget plans to provide for
                the expansion of further and higher education places, and to
                broaden access to these places through revised student support
                measures, which target those on low incomes and those who need
                additional support because of their age or need for childcare
                support. The Department will also seek to raise attainment
                levels.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The employment programme will continue to
                provide a full range of services to companies and individuals to
                promote economic growth and help increase the number of
                accessible employment opportunities. Helping people to move from
                welfare to work; encouraging lifelong learning through
                individual learning accounts and other measures; and improving
                attainment levels within the Jobskills programme will all remain
                priorities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The largest programme within our departmental
                expenditure limit is the Department of Health, Social Services
                and Public Safety. The proposals make provision for an increase
                of 8·1% in 2001-02. This reflects the Executive’s commitment
                to developing the service to meet the needs of our population,
                although this includes a technical change of £19 million from
                the social security budget, so the effective increase is 7·3%.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In our discussions in the Executive there was
                recognition of the significant demands on the Health Service.
                The Health Service needs increases of 7% or 8% simply to
                maintain standards of care due to the cost structure of the
                service. Such increases are afforded in England, yet no one
                would say that their provision is adequate for the needs of the
                community. However, there is increasing evidence that provision
                here is falling behind that available in England.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should not allow the complexity and range
                of issues that we face in the Budget to obscure the central fact
                that we have to find ways to provide adequately for the Health
                Service. This is probably the largest Budget issue that we face
                now and in the coming spending review. Change and hard choices
                lie ahead to make sure that the service’s structure,
                organisation and management serve the public interest.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was struck by the consensus that it is
                right that we should increase the relative amount we spend on
                health and provide substantial resources in the Budget now. Our
                plans will enable the Department of Health, Social Services and
                Public Safety to maintain the existing level of services;
                respond to the increasing demands of an ageing population; and
                address the rising costs of modern medicine. However, it must be
                understood that we do not have all we need to allow the
                Department to implement all of its planned service developments.
                It is impossible to find sufficient additional resources to
                cover all of the Department’s pay and price pressures.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive were advised that a consequence
                of the proposed allocation for the Department of Health, Social
                Services and Public Safety would be the deferral of the
                introduction of free nursing care for the elderly. It would also
                be necessary to re-deploy the savings in fundholding
                administration, which we had planned would support the
                management costs of the proposed local health and social care
                groups and other Programme for Government commitments. The
                Executive found that it was not possible to provide adequately
                for other services, set an appropriate rate of increase and
                avoid these deferrals. This shows clearly the nature of the
                difficult decisions that faced the Executive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a more positive note, the spending plans
                will allow continued support for smaller hospitals and cover the
                cost of the temporary transfer of services to other hospitals
                pending the outcome of the Hayes review. Provision is also
                included for the continuation of essential service commitments
                to address winter pressures and waiting lists.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Planned allocations will maintain the
                improvements in personal social services, including community
                care, children’s services, Sure Start and residential
                childcare places. Provision will also be available to address
                care for people with severe mental illnesses and learning
                disabilities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I again emphasise that many aspects of health
                programmes will be eligible to be financed under the Executive
                programme funds, and thus there is scope for these allocations
                to be increased.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Planned expenditure by the Department of the
                Environment will enable the Department to continue its programme
                of work on waste management and the control of pollution to help
                ensure that Northern Ireland meets the EU Directives on waste
                management for which extra provision was made in the 2000
                Budget. Additional funds are being made available in this Budget
                to help advance work in this area and in transport regulation
                where the Department has also to ensure compliance with EU
                regulations. Additional provision was also made in 2001-02 for
                road safety in response to the alarming accident levels on our
                roads. The Budget maintains an enhanced level of investment in
                that area to enable this important work to continue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The 2000 Budget provided an increase of
                around 25% for planning services in 2001-02 to help meet growth
                in demand; this enhanced level of service will continue to be
                supported in 2002-03. Provision has also been made for local
                government services to fully meet the costs of the de-rating
                policy to district councils and to provide for resource grants
                to less-well-off councils, though it has not been possible to
                increase this in line with inflation this year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The spending plans for the Department for
                Regional Development will sustain the investment programme for
                public transport, which shows a 36% increase over 2001-02,
                reflecting the major investment needed following the decisions
                on rail safety last year. This reflects the Executive’s
                commitment to improve and modernise Northern Ireland’s
                infrastructure. The plans also include provision for free travel
                for the elderly, following on from the allocations made for
                2001-02 in February.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Key to this is the need to invest in
                structural maintenance of our road network, which is a vital
                asset that has suffered from a lack of investment in the past.
                The Executive have agreed that this deterioration must be
                arrested and have made provision to help maintain current levels
                of investment. We will also continue to press the Chancellor to
                exempt Northern Ireland from the aggregates tax, because that
                will increase the negative environmental impact of quarrying and
                put a large number of jobs at risk in that sector of our
                economy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department for Regional Development will
                continue to invest in the development of the water and sewerage
                infrastructure to ensure that European quality standards on
                drinking water and waste water discharges can be met. The 2001
                Budget confirms continued capital funding for 2002-03 at the
                enhanced level that has been built up over the past few years.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.15 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The allocation made to the Department for
                Social Development will cover the administration of social
                security benefits, child support, housing, urban regeneration
                and community development. Those resources will enable the
                Department’s Social Security Agency to provide services to
                high standards of accuracy and to implement the welfare reform
                and modernisation programme in line with its public service
                agreement (PSA) targets.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After a successful pilot, and in conjunction
                with the Department for Employment and Learning, a single
                service will be rolled out, and a new joint jobseeker’s
                allowance process will be introduced. Customer satisfaction
                levels will be maintained, and measures to reduce fraud will
                continue. The resources will also allow the continuation of a
                substantial programme to promote measurable improvements to
                housing. Specific actions will be taken to reduce fuel poverty;
                to ensure that the Northern Ireland housing stock is maintained
                to the recommended standards of fitness and to build new homes
                that are accessible to people on low incomes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An active programme of urban regeneration and
                community development will continue. A new neighbourhood renewal
                strategy will be developed, and community support plans for all
                district council areas will be introduced.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Office of the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister will receive a modest increase in
                provision, which will be used to fund key research on equality
                and policy effectiveness and the expansion of several existing
                programmes. The plans will enable the Office to continue to
                provide effective support to the Executive and to develop and
                implement actions relating to anti- discrimination law,
                improving community relations, a children’s strategy and the
                effective implementation of New Targeting Social Need (TSN)
                policy. Representative offices will be maintained in Brussels
                and Washington.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, the Budget proposals also include
                appropriate provision for the Assembly, enabling the development
                of the services planned by the Assembly Commission and building
                on the good work that has already started. Provision for the
                smaller Departments will cover the administrative costs of the
                independent Northern Ireland Audit Office, the Assembly
                Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, the Northern Ireland
                Commissioner for Complaints and the Office for the Regulation of
                Electricity and Gas (OFREG).</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those are the main features of the spending
                proposals. The plans are also supported not only by the Treasury
                allocation for Northern Ireland but revenue from the regional
                rate. That revenue represents only about 6% of our spending
                power. I doubt whether it will be dealt with in 6% of the time
                that we spend on considering the Budget. I ask all Members to
                keep the issue in perspective.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Finance and Personnel Committee concluded
                in its report that any increase in the regional rate for 2002-03
                should be linked to the rate of inflation. If we had taken that
                approach we would have had to use all the additional money that
                we received in the March Budget. We received that money as a
                result of a boost to the health and education budgets. It would
                be difficult to explain to the Treasury and, more importantly,
                to patients and pupils that we had diverted our share of that
                money to ease the position on rates.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive have decided to repeat the
                increases of 7% in the domestic regional rate and 3·3% in the
                non-domestic regional rate, which they agreed and which were
                endorsed by the Assembly for this year. Our plans are based
                firmly on the conclusion that the increases will be necessary to
                sustain the spending levels on public services that I propose
                today and to show that we are looking to ratepayers to
                contribute a share to the growing costs of public services.
                Given that the standard rate of inflation is insufficient to
                meet the cost of services, it is impossible to make it the going
                rate for revenue. Although the cost of services will rise by 7%
                — and our total departmental expenditure limit will rise by
                5·8% — under these proposals, the total income from rates
                will increase by only 4·8%.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That reflects the need to hold the business
                rate as close as possible to the rate of inflation, as it is not
                out of line with the position in England. The combined effect of
                the lower increases agreed last February for 2001-02 and these
                proposals is that we will forgo £13 million of revenue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is estimated that the proposed rates
                increase will cost the average ratepayer about 29p a week.
                People in comparable circumstances elsewhere pay several pounds
                a week more than ratepayers here. Rate revenue is also
                substantially supplemented from housing benefit, which comes
                from annually managed expenditure outside the departmental
                expenditure limit. That not only ensures that the rates do not
                lead to hardship for those most in need, but also means
                additional income for the regional economy. Lower rates would
                mean that we would get less from the Treasury.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive have agreed that it would be
                inappropriate to make major changes on the rating issue before
                the review of rating policy is completed. A consultation paper
                is being prepared that will provide fuller analysis of how our
                position compares with other regions and the options for change.
                A serious debate on those issues is needed. It should take place
                as soon as possible, outside the immediate Budget context, and
                inform our future plans alongside the spending review next year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last year, I said that agreement on the
                Programme for Government and the Budget represented a very
                important step in the evolution of the new institutions. That is
                no less true now. This draft Budget marks a further step in
                breaking away from pre-devolution patterns and priorities. I
                hope that it will prepare the way for a much more fundamental
                review of priorities in the forthcoming spending review next
                year. Indeed, it is a sign of our growing economic maturity that
                we have been able to work together as an Executive in a tighter
                financial context, while having full regard for the broad range
                of responsibilities of all Departments and the services that are
                provided for all people in the community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In its report on the Budget last year, the
                Committee for Finance and Personnel urged that in future the
                presentation of the draft Budget should take place as soon after
                the summer recess as possible. I agreed that that would be the
                best way to ensure that the Assembly and Committees have as much
                time as possible to scrutinise the Budget. I am pleased that at
                least an extra two weeks have been secured for Assembly
                scrutiny, in addition to the consultation that has already taken
                place on the position report.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I therefore look forward to the Assembly’s
                scrutiny, in Committees, of our spending plans and proposals as
                set out in the draft Budget, and particularly the role of the
                Committee for Finance and Personnel in drawing together and
                facilitating the consultation. As Sir Reg Empey and Séamus
                Mallon said yesterday, this process will also include
                opportunities for debate in the Chamber on the Programme for
                Government and the Budget. Those are likely to take place in
                October or November.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today’s statement is also the start of a
                wider consultation process. The draft Programme for Government
                and the draft Budget will be widely circulated among our social
                partners in business, trade unions and the voluntary and
                community sectors and will also be made available to other
                interested individuals and groups. I commend the Budget
                proposals to the Assembly and invite all Members to consider
                them carefully. I look forward to working with the Assembly to
                complete the process of settling next year’s spending plans in
                December. We will then increasingly see that we can make a
                difference for the better and deliver the benefits of
                devolution.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is one hour for questions. I remind
                Members that this is not a time for discussion of the content of
                any particular part of the Budget. It is a time for questions.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for
                Finance and Personnel (Mr Leslie):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s very detailed
                Budget statement and, in particular, his action to address the
                Committee’s concerns last year on the timing of the scrutiny
                process. The extra time available can be well used.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the allocations, the Minister referred
                twice to the Executive programme funds. I was somewhat concerned
                that he was, in effect, treating those as a provision against
                uncertainty rather than as ring-fenced items in their own right.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also note that in his later remarks on the
                Executive programme funds he referred to the importance of
                cross-cutting. However, cross-cutting was not particularly
                apparent in the allocations that he announced. Can the Minister
                therefore comment on the extent to which the Executive programme
                funds will be ring-fenced and on the strictness of the
                cross-cutting criteria that he intends to apply?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker, you observed that this
                hour is for questions; unfortunately, it is also for answers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Budget has addressed departmental
                spending plans. The Executive programme funds are used more
                specifically to bring forward cross-cutting ideas and
                suggestions. Several Departments are leading cross- cutting
                initiatives such as the public health strategy, the task force
                on unemployability and work by the Department for Social
                Development. We should not therefore ignore the fact that some
                of the spending allocated to Departments will support
                cross-cutting activity. Obviously, other Departments should use
                their expenditure to support their own engagement and
                involvement in cross-cutting activities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to further evidence of the
                cross-cutting approach, we should not lose sight of the fact
                that the Executive have agreed the draft Budget. Ministers, who
                are conscious of their own pressures and the needs of those
                sectors which depend on their departmental budgets, have also

                the ability to deliver the draft Budget. I could also make the
                observation that many of the exchanges in relation to it have
                been both cross and cutting, but we have still emerged with an
                agreed draft Budget.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s statement and the
                increases in the departmental budgets. Can the Minister confirm
                that the children’s fund will be protected? When will
                allocations be made from the fund?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am happy to confirm that the children’s
                fund and the infrastructure fund are not counted in the amounts
                of money that may be treated or regarded as security for the
                projected carry forward. That does not mean that those other
                Executive programme funds are jeopardised. We have a fair degree
                of confidence in our assumption that the money will become
                available in monitoring rounds. Indeed, some money has already
                been held over, as Members will know if they recall my statement
                in respect of the June monitoring round.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We felt that it was important to remove the
                children’s fund from any part of that equation because of its
                intrinsic value and because it will be the subject of a major
                consultation exercise on how best the community and voluntary
                sectors should access it. Next year we will have the feedback
                from the consultation exercise, and there will be no further
                tranche of allocations from the children’s fund until then.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister emphasised that the budget for
                the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development would be
                boosted by almost £9 million by the EU peace and reconciliation
                programme. He is aware that an international conference on
                agriculture is taking place in Belfast. Last night, I spoke with
                Commissioner Byrne. He pointed out that there is additional
                money in European coffers that could be made available. However,
                that must be matched with money from the Treasury. The Minister
                is aware that the farming community wishes to see the creation
                of a retirement programme. According to the Commissioner, there
                is money available for that from Europe. Will the Minister start
                a study to see how much matching money could be obtained from
                Europe, if the other money were available? Every possible penny
                should be brought to Northern Ireland from Europe.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland should optimise any
                possibility of public expenditure support. That is why we need
                to make the case for a stronger future allocation for Northern
                Ireland to the Treasury. I work on the premise that, if European
                money is available for us, we should pursue and explore that
                possibility.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must remember that we cannot make our own
                bids to the EU for the funding; that can only happen in a UK
                context. That is not within my immediate remit, as is reflected
                in today’s Budget consideration about the departmental
                expenditure limit. The other money falls into annually-managed
                expenditure. However, as the Member raised the issue, I am sure
                that both my Department and the Department of Agriculture and
                Rural Development will look at it to see if, based on the
                Commissioner’s insights, there are some possibilities that
                have not occurred to us. However, I do not believe that that is
                something that will be distinctively available to us as a region
                or something that will be directly amenable to intervention by
                my Department.</p>

                I welcome the draft Budget and the Minister’s statement. I
                commend the Minister and his Executive Colleagues for the
                strenuous efforts that they have made to square the circle of
                the lack of public finance and to meet the needs of our
                community. It is important to acknowledge that the Minister has
                focused attention on the serious pressures that the Department
                of Health, Social Services and Public Safety faces. He also
                dealt significantly with the Barnett formula.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What proper and vigorous steps are the
                Executive taking to address the issue of the Barnett formula,
                given that we have all acknowledged that that formula has
                serious disadvantages for our community?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with the main thrust of the Member’s
                point and recognise the pressures that exist. Those pressures
                are not only on the Health Service’s budget, but they are
                particularly acute there. That is reflected in so many comments
                that are made in the Chamber and elsewhere.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The 2000 spending review highlighted the
                problems with the Barnett formula in funding the devolved
                territories.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Following the full introduction of resource
                accounting and budgeting during the 2002 spending review, the
                Executive will continue to seek changes to the Barnett formula.
                We shall also press for recognition of the level of need in
                Northern Ireland and the structural differences between the
                public sector here and that in Great Britain.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problem that we face with the Barnett
                formula is not simply a matter of whether the formula used to
                allocate funding adequately reflects our need; it is also that,
                under resource accounting and budgeting, capital charges and
                depreciation costs will move from annually- managed expenditure
                into the departmental expenditure limit. We have a much broader
                capital asset base than England; under that system road services
                will be funded from within the departmental expenditure limit.
                That is not the case in England where many of the roads are the
                responsibility of local authorities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unlike what happens across the water, our
                capital charges and depreciation costs for water and sewerage
                assets will also be covered by our departmental expenditure
                limit. The difficulty that we already face is that the Barnett
                formula gives us nothing for water and sewerage — we must fund
                those from our departmental expenditure limit. That problem will
                be compounded, and several issues must be addressed. However,
                there are also many strong retorts and challenges for us to
                face. We will not get a free run at the rickety wheel when it
                comes to challenging the Barnett formula.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister agree that, when saying
                that health must be our number one priority, we must show that
                that is true in both word and deed? Does he agree that words
                such as &quot;scandalous&quot;, &quot;unfair&quot; and
                &quot;insufficient&quot; jump out at us after only a glance at
                newspapers of recent days? Cancer sufferers are let down by
                delays; there are delays in coronary care; and hospitals are
                short of 14 orthopaedic surgeons. Such shortages have been
                brought about by underfunding and must be corrected. Does the
                Minister agree that, instead of holding money in Executive
                programme funds to provide security against shortfalls, it
                should be used now to ensure that this nation is in a good state
                of health?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I acknowledge the strength of the Member’s
                views. I fully concur with him about the pressures on the Health
                Service, and the Executive have recognised that. With regard to
                making changes to the indicative allocations that were made last
                year, we have rightly paid particular attention to health,
                schools and roads. I do not disguise the fact that we need to
                provide more funding for health services, but we can only do
                that by providing money that would otherwise go to other
                programmes. We can also raise additional revenue through the
                rates. Everyone must reflect on the genuine priority that we
                attach to such things when deciding what steps we are prepared
                to take to find the necessary money.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the Executive programme funds,
                we expect to be able to find money carried over from monitoring
                rounds this year to take into next year’s spending, and we
                will use some of that to fund health services above the
                indicative allocations. Money is not sitting idle. In the
                unlikely event of our not being able to achieve the predicted
                carry-over amounts, we shall use Executive programme funds to
                cover some of the existing pressures. We do not believe that
                that situation will arise, and so we will be in a position to
                proceed with allocations from the Executive programme funds
                between now and the revised Budget. The Department of Health,
                Social Services and Public Safety will be in a strong position
                to bid effectively for those funds.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Departments will be bidding for Executive
                programme funds in order to achieve, among other things, service
                improvements and service developments, which possibly include
                some of the areas that the Member has mentioned.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the draft Budget and particularly
                the increase in finance for health and education. I hope that
                the Minister will include ring-fenced funding for road safety in
                the larger amount available for roads.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am disappointed that there has not been
                greater emphasis placed on community relations and, in
                particular, the need to combat sectarianism. Given the events
                that have taken place in Belfast and throughout Northern
                Ireland, the Executive and the Minister should focus greater
                funding on combating sectarianism. What funding will be made
                available to deal with that matter?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The expenditure for roads is included in the
                Department for Regional Development’s budget, and road safety
                expenditure is included in the Department of the Environment’s
                budget. That reflects a budgetary increase of 16·6% — the
                amount was increased last year and has been increased again this
                year. We all understand the reasons for that increase given the
                scale of loss of life on our roads, an issue that many Members
                raised.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of the funding for community relations
                activity falls within the budget of the Office of the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister, and we want to maintain
                that level of funding. Some of the additional expenditure in the
                Department of Education will also fund work on community
                relations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is impossible to give every programme area
                the same high percentage increase. We have been able to — or
                have had to — give high increases to some areas due to
                compelling pressures or unavoidable liabilities. People must
                bear in mind that to make the difficult decisions about
                prioritisation we, as an Executive, are not reflecting only our
                natural preferences. We are reflecting what we believe to be the
                best decisions that can be made, based on matching our resources
                to our responsibilities.</p>

                Thankfully, it appears to contain less gobbledegook than many
                other statements on financial matters. I share his view that the

                of years of direct rule through investment in clean water
                provision and the effective treatment of waste water, so that
                Northern Ireland’s lakes, rivers and streams do not become

                the lack of gobbledegook in my statement — although I will
                probably now proceed to indulge in some.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As an Executive, we have realised — and it
                has been mentioned in the Chamber — that we have a huge
                infrastructure deficit in certain areas. We have tried to meet
                that deficit with last year’s and this year’s allocations
                to, for example, the Department for Regional Development. We
                have sustained the necessary and planned increases in respect of
                water services and water and sewage treatment.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are many pressing issues in that area,
                just as there are in roads and in other areas that people might
                term &quot;the soft infrastructure&quot;, with regard to key
                facilities in health and education. One reason why we have
                provided the infrastructure fund as part of the Executive
                programme funds was to allow us to bring more distinctive
                attention to bear in those areas. We need to ensure that we get
                the most out of the investment that we make. We need to ensure
                that we meet standards that our own people and those in the EU
                would expect. I reflected in my statement that those were
                relevant and pressing considerations in the decisions that we
                have made.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to make the point that water and
                sewerage services must be funded out of the total block grant
                — out of our departmental expenditure. We receive nothing in
                the Barnett formula for water and sewerage, because they are not
                part of public expenditure across the water. In circumstances in
                which we receive no Barnett allocation, the fact that we have
                been able to maintain the increased spending reflects some
                credit on the Executive. However, that in turn adds to the
                pressure in other programme areas, and people should bear in
                mind that important point in relation to revenue-raising and
                rates.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate the Minister on his statement.
                I apologise for missing the earlier part — I was opening a
                conference by Nexus on sexual child abuse. In that regard, I
                notice in the statement that the children’s fund is to be
                protected.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My question is along the same lines as Mr
                Close’s remarks. Although I appreciate that the Treasury
                allocation and the regional rate provide the funding, I want to
                talk about how that funding is used. I accept that all
                Ministers, including the Health Minister, have done their best
                to obtain the funding for their Departments. However, it is
                absolutely ridiculous that Northern Ireland, with a population
                the size of Greater Birmingham, has four health boards and 19
                trusts. Year in and year out we complain about the shortage of
                funds, yet we do not look directly at those structures. I accept
                that the Executive intend to have a review of public
                administration, and that point has been made many times. I want
                to know whether Ministers, if they so wish — and not
                necessarily with the agreement of the rest of the Executive —
                can look at structures in their Department, just as Sir Reg
                Empey was able to merge LEDU and IDB. That is vitally important
                in the context of health.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I had better acknowledge the Member’s
                question rather than thank him for it — a little outburst of
                honesty from the Minister of Finance and Personnel.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Hayes report, although it concentrated
                particularly on acute hospital services, also made a number of
                observations and recommendations in respect of broader health
                services and management structures. The Minister has already
                indicated that the report will be subject to a fuller
                consultation and, in turn, subject to full consideration by the
                Executive. Some of the issues raised by the Chairperson of the
                Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety arise in
                that context. He rightly identifies that the Executive are to
                undertake a wider review of public administration. All Ministers
                are free and able to look at various arrangements in their
                Departments. However, it would not make sense, in the context of
                a broader review, for Ministers to go on radical solo runs and
                to alter the nature of structures in circumstances in which
                congruent changes do not happen elsewhere in public
                administration.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is part of joined-up government, but the
                issues identified by the Committee Chairperson have been
                previously recognised by the Minister, and the Executive are
                aware of them.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are fewer Members in the Chamber today
                than on this occasion last year. I hope that that will not be
                repeated at the SDLP conference, or the Minister will have to
                address a smaller audience than previous leaders.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Minister tell us the increase, in
                figures and percentages, for the North/South implementation
                bodies and for the North/South Ministerial Council? That was the
                subject of some debate in last year’s Budget.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The announcement of the deferral of the
                introduction of free nursing care for the elderly will cause
                great disappointment, especially as that is to proceed in
                Scotland. Does the Minister acknowledge that the proposal
                received unanimous support in the House? It has been widely
                welcomed. Will the Minister undertake to review the subject?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There will also be disappointment about the
                decision to retain the above-inflation rate increase for
                domestic ratepayers, which is double the rate of inflation. Will
                the Minister also take the opportunity to look at that? I can
                almost anticipate his answer. We can go into more detail on
                those issues later, in Committee and elsewhere.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask the Minister to look at those issues,
                particularly free nursing care, which affects the elderly in our
                community across the board.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Like other Members of the Executive, I fully
                appreciate the importance of achieving free nursing care. For
                that reason, we allocated £3 million in last year’s Budget to
                introduce it. However, it could not be introduced, for
                legislative and other reasons, so further commitments of
                approximately £6 million were made in the indicative
                allocations in next year’s Budget. That is the baseline. That
                money will not now be adequate to cover the cost of free nursing
                care because of changing patterns of demand and other pressures,
                but it has not been withdrawn from the Health Service budget.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members may recall that the Executive have
                agreed that, should any further money become available to ease
                our planning position for next year, first consideration will be
                given to any Programme for Government commitments that have been
                deferred. Members’ comments about that particular commitment
                will be reflected and remembered by the Executive. Members are
                welcome to help to identify any other means to obtain additional
                resources.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The provisions to meet next year’s legal
                obligations regarding the North/South implementation bodies are
                as follows: Waterways Ireland will receive £3 million; the
                North/South Language Body will receive £3·6 million; the Food
                Safety Promotion Board will receive £1·5 million; the Trade
                and Business Development Body will receive £3 million; the
                Special EU Programmes Body will receive £800,000; and the
                Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission will receive
                £900,000.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The percentage increases are: 17% for
                Waterways Ireland; 6% for the North/South Language Body; 3·4%
                for the Trade and Business Development Body; 2·1% for the Food
                Safety Promotion Board; 47·5% for the Foyle, Carlingford and
                Irish Lights Commission; and 31·6% for the Special EU
                Programmes Body.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That reflects the fact that some of the
                spending, particularly in relation to providing secretarial
                support for the new Northern Ireland Regional Partnership Board,
                falls fully to the northern Administration and is not shared.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Cobain:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to ask the Minister for some
                clarification on a number of points. In yesterday’s debate on
                the draft Programme for Government, we were told that housing
                unfitness in Housing Executive houses would be reduced in the
                next two years and that all Housing Executive houses would be
                kept to a recommended standard. In the draft Budget, the finance
                directed to the Housing Executive is to be cut yet again. Will
                the Minister explain the relationship between the draft
                Programme for Government and the draft Budget, and where the
                money is to be made available?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Funding for the urban regeneration and
                community development programmes has been cut again this year.
                With regard to the Executive programme funds, the social
                inclusion/community regeneration fund is £34 million, yet the
                Department for Social Development gets £400,000 out of £33·5
                million. The Minister keeps emphasising that each of those
                budgets contains a percentage to target social need. Will he
                explain how we will achieve that on an ever-reducing Budget?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remind Members that the Department for
                Social Development is getting an increase of 8·6% in the draft
                Budget. That includes an increase of 3·2% in the total housing
                budget. The Budget provides around £290 million for housing
                support by the Department, excluding house sales; that is an
                increase of 7%. However, total expenditure on housing also
                depends on the level of rental income that the Housing Executive
                receives from its tenants.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Taking that and other factors into account,
                the actual amount available for housing is over £630 million,
                based on the present estimate for the level of rental income.
                That level of provision will enable the Department to continue
                its capital investment programme in new housing, to maintain and
                renovate existing properties and to ensure compliance with
                fitness standards.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members may wish to go back and check the
                various bids that were made previously on the Executive
                programme funds. Those bids informed the allocations that have
                been made and that have been reflected here. Further allocations
                are to be made from the Executive programme funds for next year.
                I am aware, and I can anticipate, that there will be some strong
                bids from the Department for Social Development, possibly in
                conjunction with other Departments.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for Culture,

                the additional resources for our Department, particularly for
                the museum service. I welcome the fact that Museums and
                Galleries of Northern Ireland (MAGNI) will now be able to
                proceed with some of the work that it must do.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee will be concerned about the
                arts sector. We are all preparing for Belfast’s bid to be
                European City of Culture 2008. We shall be concerned that there
                is no additional identification for that area, particularly
                given some of the capital requests that are around.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a more general issue, will the Minister
                confirm that the work of all the Departments to identify
                resources that can be redeployed against the priorities of the
                Programme for Government, and consequently against the real
                needs of the people, will continue?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Chairman of the Committee for
                Culture, Arts and Leisure for that. It should not be forgotten
                that arts fared well last year. There was an increase of £1·4
                million in 2001-02 as compared with 2000-01. That has been
                carried forward to this year. It should also be remembered that
                the arts figures do not take account of possible assistance that
                I have every reason to believe the Department of Culture, Arts
                and Leisure will be seeking from the Executive programme funds
                for at least one of the matters that the Member raised.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Finance and Personnel and
                the Executive will not stop Departments from trying to re-
                prioritise and examine whether or not their plans make the best
                use of the resources available. Any decisions taken must be
                consistent with the Executive’s overall strategy and the
                Programme for Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that the fact that the Chairman of the
                Committee has raised this question means that it will be the
                focus of the Committee’s attention. That is important, because
                it is easy for all of us to focus on the bids that have not been
                met and chase after them when the money is not available to meet
                them. We need to make sure, not just that we know what has
                happened to bids, but that we know what is happening to
                planning.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We heard yesterday about the Programme for
                Government and the review of public administration, and Dr
                Hendron has already raised that issue. Where is the finance for
                the review of public administration? I understand that it is
                going to take £2 million, but I do not see that in the Budget.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We were also told yesterday that we were to
                have a children’s commissioner in place by June. Leaving aside
                the funding for the children’s strategy, which is a separate
                issue, where is the finance for a children’s commissioner?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the funding for victims, a bid for
                £500,000 was submitted and that was granted. A marker bid for a
                further £750,000 was lodged. How much additional funding has
                been included in the draft Budget, and how much will actually
                translate into practical support for the victims?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Civic Forum seems to have done well out
                of this Budget: it is getting an increase of £200,000 over its
                current £300,000. That has been noted.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most of the issues that the Member asked
                about fall into the budget for the Office of the First Minister
                and the Deputy First Minister, and that will see a modest
                increase.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive are trying to address the needs
                of victims through a variety of methods. A consultation document
                on a victims strategy was published on 6 August. Further
                decisions and developments depend on the outcome of that. The
                Executive have contributed £1·67 million to the Peace II
                victims measures. That will address victims’ needs in a
                variety of ways. In addition, £500,000 from the social
                inclusion Executive programme fund will be available to the
                Victims Unit this year, and in each of the next two years.
                Ongoing discussions continue with the Northern Ireland Office,
                as overlapping and converging interests are involved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The increase for the Civic Forum represents
                the additional provision required to meet the full-year costs of
                the forum operating with its own stand-alone secretariat.
                Additional resources have also been made available to the
                Strategic Issues Unit in the Office of the First Minister and
                the Deputy First Minister, which has responsibility for major
                strategic cross-cutting matters such as the review of public

                prioritisation and re-prioritisation is a crucial part of being
                in Government? Will he confirm that his ministerial colleagues
                were involved in — and agreed to — the decisions to make
                available additional resources for health, education and the
                roads?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We were able to achieve adjustments from the
                indicative allocations that were agreed last year, and the fact
                that, in making those adjustments, we focused our attention on
                health, schools and roads shows that ministerial colleagues
                recognise the importance of investing in those services and
                funding those programmes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It must be said, however, that Ministers have
                pressures on their own budgets, and they are responsible for
                services that face many difficulties. In some cases, those
                pressures are felt by the community and by the customer; in
                other cases, they arise from pressing contractual obligations or
                from infraction of EU regulations. Despite those pressures, we
                were able to recognise general priorities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must continue to examine our priorities.
                We must ask whether we are getting as much as we can out of the
                money that we spend and whether we need to do more. That task is
                not just part of the job of Government; it is part of the
                scrutiny role performed by the Assembly and its Committees.</p>

                the strategy devised by the Department for Employment and
                Learning. Some 250,000 people in Northern Ireland are performing
                at the lowest levels. What financial resources will the Minister
                direct towards improving that totally unacceptable situation?
                How much is available for potential Executive programme fund
                bids in the current year, next year and 2003-04? What are the
                criteria for assessing the bids, which will, no doubt, exceed
                the funds available?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for his questions, but I
                will not be able to answer them all. It is not that I do not
                have answers available, but I do not want to take up time that
                could be used for other questions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Annual allocations have previously reflected
                the priorities needed in literacy and numeracy, as shown by the
                figures identified by Mr Carrick. The budget for the Department
                for Employment and Learning includes further funding for the
                further education sector, and it is in the further education
                provisions that the Department for Employment and Learning will
                be carrying forward its work in relation to literacy and
                numeracy. Obviously, the Member can continue to bring that
                matter forward.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The amounts of money for the Executive
                programme funds are as previously published. The Department of
                Finance and Personnel recognises that there is an outside chance
                that some of the money that we plan to allocate for next year
                might have to be absorbed to cover some of the projected
                carry-over. I do not believe that that will happen. The
                Department will make allocations in the Executive programme
                funds between now and the revised Budget, and it has not changed
                the figures for each year from those published previously.</p>

                and congratulate him on the emphasis he has put on priority
                assessment of the quantum spending of each Department. Given
                that the Barnett formula is a factor which limits resources for
                Northern Ireland, what other ways are being explored to find
                more funding — particularly for infrastructure investment?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will it ever be possible for Members to see
                Treasury figures regarding fiscal revenue receipts from this
                region, so that the Assembly can have a fuller appraisal of
                Northern Ireland’s public finance position?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not know if it will ever be possible for
                Members to see those Treasury figures.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are determined to address the issue of the
                Barnett formula, and we do have to press for the changes
                necessary to secure a fair allocation of resources for services
                here. That must be based on an objective assessment of our
                needs. As Mr Byrne stated, we need to try to maximise the
                resources available from other sources. That must include
                adopting more effective procurement policies and levering in
                funds from the private sector through, for instance,
                public-private partnerships (PPP) where appropriate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also need to continue to find more
                efficient ways of working across Government, and there is a
                particular need to reduce the costs of administration. If we
                succeed in doing that, more money will be released for services
                and constructive investment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must also look at the arrangements for
                maximising return from our assets. That means ensuring the
                disposal of those that are no longer required, when that is
                possible. We must also take a strategic approach to addressing
                those issues through the Programme for Government. We need to
                ensure that our determination to find more money for services
                applies as much to the scrutiny and consideration of our
                spending plans as it does to the bids and submissions that we
                make to the Treasury.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When developing a Programme for Government
                and the Budget for 2002-03 the Executive listed &quot;Growing as
                a Community&quot; as one of their priorities. However, one
                section of the community — its senior citizens — continues
                to be the victim of cutbacks. Members have already heard Mr
                Dodds describe the health care situation. What resources could
                be made available to redress the voids created by the loss of
                community agencies, such as Y Services, which provided external
                and internal works at homes, and the virtual removal of the
                meals-on-wheels service in many constituencies? Will additional
                resources be made available to enhance the quality of life for
                senior citizens?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Free nursing care is not something that was
                available and is now being cut; we were trying to provide it,
                and it was previously budgeted for. The amount previously
                budgeted for free nursing care has not been enough to enable us
                to provide it in next year’s Budget because of other pressures
                and other patterns of need. Those pressures and patterns of need
                also relate to the elderly population.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not a case of moving money out of
                elderly care and into another area. We are not moving money out
                of the health and social services baseline. The Budget contains
                improved provisions that will help older people. Free transport
                is provided for the elderly, and some of the spending on
                measures to counter fuel poverty will, in many cases, be going
                to the homes of older people and those whose homes are older and
                less fuel efficient.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In many cases the range of services falls to
                non- departmental public bodies such as health and social
                services trusts. Personal social services are seeing an uplift
                of 12·1% in the draft Budget proposals, and much of the rising
                demand and pressure in personal social services relates to the
                elderly population.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr William McCrea:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The red warning light flashed yesterday when
                the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister made a
                35-minute speech containing nothing about the Department of the
                Environment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is the Minister aware of a statement on the
                Budget issued today by Mr Foster? He points out that the
                Executive’s allocation cuts £2 million from the resources
                grant payable to those district councils with the weakest rate
                bases. The weakest councils will find in the resource grant that
                they have to carry out their work with £2 million removed from
                their budget. Can the Minister tell us how those weakest
                councils will make up the deficit?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is this not a form of taxation on the
                weakest, through the back door? Mr Foster’s statement shows
                that the reason for this cut is to work towards compliance with
                EU legislation on waste management. The £2 million will be
                taken from the weakest in respect of waste management and will
                be given to the strongest. Where is the justice in that? How
                will the deficit be made up by those councils?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I drew attention to this subject in the
                Budget statement, although I do not believe that the Member was
                present.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of the Environment has an
                uplift of 8·1%, contrary to a suggestion implicit in the Member’s
                opening remarks. As far as local government services are
                concerned, the grant to councils is not something that we can
                increase with the rate of inflation. That is what the
                Environment Minister advised the Executive. The Minister has
                made a statement to that effect.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive and I dealt with a range of
                bids and pressures from the Department of the Environment and
                other Departments. Provision is being made for a 1·2% increase
                in local government services, and it is recognised that that
                does not match inflation. There is an overall 8·1% increase in
                that Department’s budget. I look forward to reading the
                conclusions of the Committee for the Environment, in the light
                of earlier questions about Committees wishing to explore issues
                of re-prioritisation.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That this Assembly believes, in the context
                of the development of a Bill of Rights, that the Northern
                Ireland Human Rights Commission has failed to discharge its
                remit, as given to it by the Belfast Agreement 1998, in its
                various contributions to the debate on developing human rights
                in Northern Ireland.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This motion questions whether the Commission
                has kept within its remit. It is not a motion about whether
                human rights are, to quote from the old book ‘1066 and All
                That’, &quot;A Good Thing&quot;. Human rights are a good
                thing, but they require careful definition. The Belfast
                Agreement said that the Commission was to be</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;invited to consult and to advise on the
                scope for defining, in Westminster legislation, rights
                supplementary to those in the European Convention on Human
                Rights (ECHR) to reflect the particular circumstances of
                Northern Ireland&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Note that the agreement said &quot;advise and
                consult on the scope&quot;. It did not say &quot;campaign and
                dictate&quot;.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The critical point in today’s debate is
                whether the Commission has kept within that remit, especially in
                the booklet ‘Making a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland’
                published earlier this month. I believe that it has not. By
                definition, human rights apply to human beings, so it is not
                self-evident that a human being in Belfast should be afforded
                more or less protection than a counterpart in, say, Birmingham
                or Berlin. At the very least, the Commission needs to have done
                much more to establish its case. I will address three ways in
                which Northern Ireland’s &quot;particular circumstances&quot;
                might be argued to be relevant, and evaluate the Commission’s
                response.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First is the constitutional question. In
                other parts of western and eastern Europe there are also
                disputes about the national identity of various territorities.
                Significantly, the European-wide Organisation for Security and
                Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) has enshrined the principle that
                national frontiers should stand, given consent and
                self-determination. Our Commission, the official human rights
                body, has pointedly, but unsurprisingly — given its own
                intellectual descent from the Committee on the Administration of
                Justice — declared neutrality on the constitutional position.
                Is it proper for an official human rights body to enshrine such
                neutrality? No.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, the particular circumstances of
                Northern Ireland should include the awful death toll consequent
                from terrorism over the past 32 years. In pro rata terms, it is
                equivalent to New York City suffering 20,000 fatalities, or
                three World Trade Centre atrocities. Using the &quot;cost of the
                troubles&quot; figures, of the 3,593 people who were killed
                between 1969 and February 1998, 56% died as a result of
                Republican group action, 27% at the hands of Loyalists and 382,
                or 11%, as a consequence of state action.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Undoubtedly, almost all the latter cases were
                legitimate self-defence. However, so far, the Northern Ireland
                Human Rights Commission (NIHRC) has given privileged
                consideration to the perceived victims of state action as
                opposed to the greater numbers of victims of paramilitary abuse.
                Regrettably, they are again following the pattern set by the
                Committee for the Administration of Justice (CAJ). Persons with
                a CAJ background continue to have a disproportionate
                representation on the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission (NIHRC).</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On page 46 of the September 2001 document ‘Making
                a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland’ the commission argues
                that search-and-seizure operations should not be used in the
                future, as they allegedly have been in the past, to harass
                certain sections of the community. No proof beyond the anecdotal
                is provided for their assertion of guilt.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In chapter 18, on the enforcement of any bill
                of rights, it refers to &quot;human rights violations&quot;
                rather than to violations and abuses. This seems to imply a sole
                focus on perceived state-led violations of rights. To date, the
                commission has added little or nothing to the most basic of
                rights — the right to life. It has leaned too far towards
                protecting the rights of those terrorists who in the past —
                and in the present — have taken innocent life.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The third way in which the NIHRC claims to be
                reflecting particular circumstances is with respect to social
                and economic deprivation in Northern Ireland. Every Member of
                the Assembly should be concerned about such deprivation — low
                wages, unfit housing, sickness rates, lack of basic numeracy and
                literacy, et cetera. We should all strive for improvement, as
                was said in the Budget debate. However, Northern Ireland is no
                longer uniquely deprived. Other parts of the United Kingdom, for
                example Wales, share similar gross domestic product (GDP) per
                capita levels, wage rates and illiteracy rates. Yet no one has
                credibly suggested supplementary rights to the European
                Commission on Human Rights in those cases.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whatever the noble intent of most
                socio-economic rights, their realisation is crucially dependent
                on increased economic resources or public spending. Therefore,
                they may not be justiciable. In other words, they cannot be
                created by waving the magic wand of a court decision. They need
                public spending resources, voted for politically, through the
                Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In short, the commission has acted outside
                its remit, as defined in the Belfast Agreement. In this, as in
                everything else, we are arguing for full implementation — no
                more, no less. The commission, unconvincingly, tries to use
                section 69(3)(b) of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 to trump the
                agreement on page 14 of the September document. It interpreted
                its assigned task, to promote awareness of human rights, in the
                wider scope of promoting the human-rights culture. This matters
                because human rights can be a powerful ideology. It has almost
                become a secular religion, constituting as it does a novel, and
                sometimes disturbing, use of language and a way of prescribing
                how people should behave.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will go through some of the commission’s
                detailed policy proposals in the lengthy September 2001
                document. On page 21 it recommends proportional representation
                for Westminster elections. On page 22 it suggests removing the
                debarment of the mentally ill from election candidacy and the
                reduction of the voting age to 16 or 17.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Page 33 refers, incongruously, to a right to
                positive action. It is unclear whether that implies positive
                discrimination and, therefore, the absurd right to be
                discriminated against in certain circumstances. The commission
                has previously endorsed the fifty-fifty policing quota of the
                Patten report.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Pages 37 and 89 refer to &quot;access to
                sexual reproductive healthcare&quot;. What does that mean in
                practice? Could it be a back door to introducing abortion on
                demand in Northern Ireland? Page 60 refers to equality for
                &quot;long-term domestic partnerships&quot; relative to
                traditional marriage. Page76 recommends that education be
                conditioned to inculcate support for the ideology of human
                rights. Presumably, the commission’s own interpretation of
                rights — and interpretations vary — would be the authorised
                version in schools.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That very extensive list — and much more
                can be found in the document — reminds me of Jeremy Bentham’s
                dismissal of the French Revolution’s Declaration of the Rights
                of Man and of the Citizen as &quot;imaginary rights, a bastard
                brood of monsters&quot;. In short, there is an attempt to
                achieve massive social engineering to reconstruct the totality
                of Northern Ireland, as though it were a blank sheet and to
                forget about the wishes of the majority. What role in the
                process is left for the Assembly or for the sovereign
                Westminster Parliament? Not very much.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Northern Ireland, certain interest groups
                have stirred up extraordinary expectations of the perceived
                improvements that could be delivered by a bill of rights,
                particularly with respect to the social and economic position.
                Those with such expectations are almost bound to be
                disappointed. That is politically worrying and indeed cruel. One
                indicator of the commission’s rather grand view of its remit
                — indeed, its global reach far beyond this Province — is the
                commentary last week by the chief commissioner of the NIHRC, who
                was quoted in the press on 20 September. He criticised the
                American President, no less, for his choice of language to
                describe the attacks on Manhattan and Washington.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Every Member should pause before endorsing
                the commission’s maximalist interpretation of human rights. A
                maximalist human rights culture is in danger of eclipsing this
                institution. Under direct rule, limited democratic
                accountability lasted for too long. The intervention of a
                massive bill of rights into all areas of policy-making would
                imply that judges would have decision-making powers that would
                otherwise rightly rest with this democratically accountable
                body.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In summary, we do not criticise human rights
                per se; rather, we criticise the way in which the commission has
                so far chosen to interpret them. Speaking in the House of
                Commons on the first day of the second world war, 3 September
                1939, Winston Churchill said that that war was necessary in
                order to &quot;establish, on impregnable rocks, the rights of
                the individual&quot;. Rights are worth protecting — a lesson
                that, in these weeks, is being learned once again on an
                international level.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problem with the commission’s document,
                and, indeed, its record to date, is that it combines undue
                protection for those who are the ultimate enemies of liberty,
                with the pursuit of other rights that are both undefinable and
                undeliverable. I therefore urge support for the motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Attwood:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I beg to move the following amendment: Delete

                Ireland.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposer of the motion said that he was
                not criticising human rights per se. I welcome that, because the
                alternative would be grotesque. I cannot, however, welcome much
                else that he said.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie said that the bill of rights
                proposals do not refer to the right of self-determination or to
                the principle of consent. That is rightly so, because, as he
                knows, those issues are already exhaustively and extensively
                addressed in the Good Friday Agreement, in the amendments to the
                Irish Constitution, Bunreacht na hÉireann, arising from the
                Good Friday Agreement and in the Northern Ireland Act 1998.
                Legislative and statutory guarantees already recognise the Irish
                people’s right to self-determination and to the principle of
                consent. Given that there are constitutional guarantees in law
                and in practice, it would be highly improper if, in a bill of
                rights, we should then create a Constitution in regard to those
                issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I suggest that Dr Birnie’s wish to see
                those principles addressed reveals his lack of confidence in
                that for which the Irish people voted and which was endorsed by
                the British Parliament, the Irish Parliament and the Irish
                people in the referendum and in the Northern Ireland Act 1998.
                There is every reason to be confident in relation to the
                constitutional position of the North, and there is no further
                reason to put into a bill of rights that which is already
                secured and guaranteed elsewhere in the British and Irish
                states.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie quoted the Good Friday Agreement,
                which says that the bill of rights should</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;reflect the particular circumstances of
                Northern Ireland&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In that regard, he then criticised the fact
                that the bill of rights outlines proposals in respect of
                economic and social guarantees. Are we not saying that in
                Northern Ireland there are particular circumstances that extend
                to economic and social issues? Should people who suffer economic
                and social disadvantage — whatever their background — not
                have the protection of the law and the benefit of good practice
                when it comes to improving their conditions?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposed bill of rights says that, given
                that the communities of the North have a common need and a
                common agenda in regard to economic and social guarantees and
                protections, these should be protected and enhanced. Dr Birnie,
                however, says that there should not be recognition of the
                particular inequalities, needs, disadvantages and requirements
                of both our communities as regards economic and social welfare.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rather than saying that the bill of rights
                proposals should not guarantee economic and social rights, I
                suggest that in a society which is emerging from conflict and
                based around difference in that conflict, we should actively
                seek opportunities to promote common agendas and common needs.
                The bill of rights enables that to be addressed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie also said that the issue of victims
                was inadequately addressed and that the needs of the victims of
                non-state abuses have not been addressed in the various
                interventions of the Human Rights Commission since its formation
                three years ago.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is an inaccurate representation of what
                the Human Rights Commission has done. Those who can use the
                Internet — that does not include me — should download the
                submissions and casework of the Human Rights Commission from the
                past three years. It runs to three pages and covers 80 or 90
                separate activities. When that material is analysed, it shows
                that the proposer’s conclusion does not stand against the
                evidence. The evidence confirms that the Human Rights Commission
                has attempted to cover every aspect of life in Northern Ireland’s
                communities in an effort to address and identify human rights
                issues. The commission’s work is as exhaustive and expansive
                as its limited powers and resources allow.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have no doubt that the proposer believes
                that, when it comes to interventions in court cases in Northern
                Ireland, there is a tendency for the Human Rights Commission not
                to address non-state abuses. There have been only 20 instances
                in three years in which the Human Rights Commission has sought
                to intervene, under its limited powers, in cases arising from
                killings and the use of violence in the North. In those
                instances, the cases tended to involve state killings rather
                than non-state killings, but the Human Rights Commission will
                also intervene in court cases relating to the activities of
                non-state organisations. The best evidence for that is that the
                commission intervened in the inquest into the deaths in Omagh.
                After the greatest atrocity committed against human life and
                standards in Northern Ireland, the Northern Ireland Human Rights
                Commission, at the invitation of the Coroner for Greater
                Belfast, intervened on behalf of the families of the Omagh
                victims to assert their right to see the evidence that the RUC
                made available to the inquest. In that case, the Human Rights
                Commission intervened to ensure that the rights of the victims
                of a non-state organisation were protected and enhanced. There
                is no more eloquent and powerful evidence of the commission’s
                readiness to intervene — without fear or favour and regardless
                of whether someone has been the victim of state or non-state
                violence — on behalf of citizens in the North.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the proposer of the motion wants to talk
                about the Human Rights Commission and the bill of rights and
                about how they protect the victims in Northern Ireland, he
                should consider that evidence and see that they are impartial.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member placed great emphasis on the Omagh
                case. Will he concede that the Human Rights Commission attempted
                to prevent the broadcasting of the BBC ‘Panorama’ programme,
                against the apparent wishes of the families of the victims of
                that atrocity?</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The point is that it is difficult to balance
                the rights of victims, the right to privacy, the right to
                information and all the other relevant rights. The intervention
                of a body such as the Human Rights Commission can be open to a
                certain interpretation by one side or the other.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fact that the Human Rights Commission
                intervened to try to restrain what the BBC might publish, and to
                ensure that victims and their families had more information than
                they might otherwise have received, confirms its best intentions
                rather than the Member’s worst fears. By intervening in that
                way, the Human Rights Commission confirmed its good faith, good
                intentions, good standards and good values. Its intervention was
                not evidence of partiality and unfairness, as the Member
                concludes. Dr Birnie’s point confirms my point rather than
                disproving it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will deal with some issues that were not
                addressed by the proponent of the motion. Rather than damn the
                Human Rights Commission, I praise it and would try to enhance
                it. Rather than claim that the bill of rights does not meet the
                standards that Dr Birnie says would be appropriate, we must try
                to enable the commission to meet the standards that would enable
                it to provide all the citizens of the North with the fullest
                possible protection and enforcement of human rights.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a matter for regret that Dr Birnie did
                not take the opportunity to address issues identified by the
                Human Rights Commission in its response to the Secretary of
                State’s review of its powers and resources, which were
                authorised by the Northern Ireland Act 1998. I would be more
                convinced by the proponent’s comments if he had dealt with the
                wider agenda of trying to strengthen the Human Rights Commission
                with the powers and resources needed to identify and address all
                human rights issues in the North. That is what we have tried to
                do in our amendment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the moment, according to the Human Rights
                Commission, it does not have the powers and resources that it
                needs to enable it to do all that it would like to do. Its
                restricted powers and limited budget have prevented the
                commission from carrying out the extensive consultation on the
                bill of rights that it wished to do. It was unable to organise
                event training in preparation for the implementation of the
                Human Rights Act 1998 in October 2000; nor was it able to create
                a presence outside Belfast. It was unable to employ as many
                staff as it needed to deal with research, investigations,
                legislation, policy and educational development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Human Rights Commission has a limited
                budget of £750,000, which is 10 times less than the Equality
                Commission’s funding, and the same amount that the RUC spends
                on 10 hours of activities in one year. Rather than condemn it
                for what it has produced, we should try to enhance it by giving
                it the powers and moneys that it requires. That is particularly
                relevant at the moment, because we are on the threshold of a new
                beginning for policing. The Patten Report said that human rights
                should be at the core of a new beginning for policing. The Human
                Rights Commission has a statutory function to ensure that human
                rights legislation is complied with and that that compliance is
                witnessed throughout Northern Ireland. If it is starved of its
                resources, it will be starved of the ability to give life to the
                new beginning for policing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Government might be about to announce the
                independent members of the Police Board. Is it not, therefore,
                appropriate to enable the policing board to carry out its
                functions and to give the Human Rights Commission the moneys
                needed to enable it to perform its statutory role of assisting
                the Police Board to fulfil its human rights requirements? The
                Republic of Ireland set up its statutory Human Rights Commission
                only a matter of weeks ago. Is it not time to upgrade the
                funding of the Human Rights Commission in the North to enable it
                to work with the commission in the South? That would enable them
                to build the joint programme of work and create the charter of
                rights, which are envisaged in the Good Friday Agreement, and
                which would be applicable to the citizens, political parties and
                the Governments on this island.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is it not time to enhance the moneys of the
                Human Rights Commission in the North to enable it to work with
                its sister body in the South and ensure human rights compliance
                through a chartered bill of rights on this island? Is it not
                time to give the Human Rights Commission additional moneys so
                that the problems identified whereby the commission cannot
                adequately intervene on behalf of a third party in various court
                proceedings on this island can be addressed? The commission
                should be able to intervene so that people appearing before a
                court can benefit from the help of a statutory agency in
                preparing their case, and the court could also benefit from the
                expertise of the Human Rights Commission when a hearing is
                scheduled. In that way, rather than deny and diminish the role
                of the Human Rights Commission in the North, we can enable it
                and enhance its powers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I make these points because as Frank Wright,
                an academic at Queen’s University, once said, &quot;when
                conflicts are fully developed, they revolve around issues of
                law, order and justice&quot;. Our experiences on this island in
                the last 30 years confirm that the conflict has always revolved
                around issues of law, order and justice. That is why those
                issues are put centre-stage in the Good Friday Agreement: that
                is why reports were commissioned on policing and on criminal
                justice; and that is why the agreement provided for the creation
                of the Equality Commission, the Human Rights Commission, the
                Police Ombudsman and the Prisoners’ Release Commission. To
                fully resolve the conflict that has revolved around issues of
                law, order and justice, we put mechanisms in place to address
                those issues, including the Human Rights Commission.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why is that significant, not just for us, but
                internationally? When Mary Robinson was here in December 1999,
                she said that countries around the world, particularly those
                emerging from conflicts, were most interested in the Good Friday
                Agreement because of its human rights provisions. People around
                the world could easily and quickly identify with those
                provisions. If we can get our human rights mechanisms right —
                if they function properly and defend the rights of citizens and
                communities in the North — then we will provide an example of
                conflict resolution to other communities and other countries
                that are emerging from conflict. If we can get our bill of
                rights and our Human Rights Commission right, then we will be a
                candle in the darkness that is about to invade the world order.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. Not surprisingly, I
                cannot support the amendment that has been put down in the name
                of Mr Attwood and Ms Lewsley. The issue of human rights is
                fundamental — the establishment of good human rights is
                something we should all support. However, the role played by the
                Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission has diminished the
                human rights issue in Northern Ireland. It has led many people
                to reflect that those who speak for human rights issues are
                speaking on behalf of criminals, terrorists, and people who do
                not wish goodwill to others in our country.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Often, those who represent the Northern
                Ireland Human Rights Commission seem more interested in the
                rights of criminals and terrorists than in the rights of
                ordinary individuals. When the Northern Ireland Human Rights
                Commission was set up, Mo Mowlam gave it the kiss of death by
                her appointment of the board. Two SDLP members were appointed.
                It comes as no surprise that the SDLP are leading the fight
                today in defending the commission – <i>[Interruption].</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Hegarty was one member. I do not have a
                note of the names with me, but another member of the SDLP was
                appointed at that time.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No member of the SDLP was appointed to the
                Human Rights Commission.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is fact. Ms Hegarty was not a member of
                the SDLP at the time of her appointment. She had left the SDLP
                several years before her appointment. I assume the other person
                to whom the Member refers is Mr Donnelly. He was an SDLP
                councillor back in the early 70s and is no longer a member of
                the party. He was not a member of the SDLP at the time of his
                appointment.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept that you can leave the SDLP. You
                might not be able to leave the IRA just as easily, but you can
                leave the SDLP. Nevertheless, the fact that they had membership
                of the SDLP made their political allegiances quite clear.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Human Rights Commission did not have
                representatives from the Unionist community, nor did it have
                people who had previously been members of either of the main
                Unionist parties. In fact, some people of good standing in the
                community, who had a good legal background and who were well
                placed to take positions on the Human Rights Commission, were
                refused places. I understand that as resignations from the Human
                Rights Commission have taken place, the current Secretary of
                State, and the previous Secretary of State, sought to remedy
                that situation. However, because people felt that the
                credibility of the Human Rights Commission was at a low ebb,
                they wanted to take no part in it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has failed to gain the confidence of the
                Unionist community by its actions. For example, it has given
                support to the Finucane, Hamill and Rosemary Nelson cases but
                has failed to give support to the cases of Billy Wright,
                Superintendents Buchanan and Breen or Lord Justice Gibson. The
                Commission also did a critical analysis on the use of plastic
                bullets but did not seem to take much account of those people
                who were in the line of fire and had to use plastic bullets. It
                did not appear to give much credence to the fact that people’s
                lives were being put at risk by petrol and acid bombs, bricks
                and even live bullets being fired at them, yet it is very
                critical of the use of plastic bullets by the RUC.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It complains about a lack of resources —
                the commission has some £750,000 — yet it clearly spent a
                great deal of money on the document ‘Enhancing the Rights of
                Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual People in Northern Ireland’. This is
                a fairly extensive document — a document that was not
                published without a great deal of cost. I have to say that some
                of the proposals in the document are extremely offensive. For
                example, it reckons that the Blood Transfusion Service’s ban
                on men who have engaged in anal sex, from donating blood — one
                of several categories of exclusion from blood donation — to be
                discrimination. The commission believes that it is a human right
                for homosexuals to be able to give blood. I say that it is a
                human right for people receiving blood to know that they are
                getting clean blood — blood that has not been contaminated
                with the HIV virus. I believe that it is essentially wrong to be
                claiming, on the one hand, to be protecting one person’s human
                rights but, on the other, to be attacking the human rights of
                other individuals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Often when we see the case being put for one
                individual’s human rights, it actually undermines the human
                rights of another individual. I noted that its ‘Making a Bill
                of Rights for Northern Ireland’ mentions language rights. This
                document says that everyone has the right to communicate with
                any public body through an interpreter, translator or
                facilitator. If we were to go down that road, with the
                Department for Regional Development having somebody in every
                office who could translate into Gaelic and into Ulster-Scots,
                and if every school, hospital and Housing Executive office in
                Northern Ireland were to have a translator, how much would it
                cost? What are the cost implications of many of the
                recommendations of the Human Rights Commission? If such costs
                were to be met, how many more people would be waiting for hip
                operations or cardiac surgery? How many more people would be
                discriminated against because too few houses were being built in
                their area?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposals of the Human Rights Commission,
                in many cases, are not costed. It claims that people are being
                discriminated against, but if the commission’s proposals were
                to be implemented, many more people would be discriminated
                against.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Attwood defended the Human Rights
                Commission by reference to its support for the victims of the
                Omagh bomb. When representatives of the Human Rights Commission
                were before the Committee of the Centre, I asked what its views
                were on two particular victims of the Omagh bomb, the twin
                children who were murdered while still within their mother’s
                womb, seven months into her pregnancy. They did not have a view
                on that. They could not express a view on it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Attwood is therefore defending a Human
                Rights Commission that will not defend the human rights of
                unborn children. It could not admit that the rights of two
                unborn children were destroyed by the Real IRA. What sort of
                Human Rights Commission is that? The children were healthy in
                their mother’s womb, but because they did not happen to have
                been two months older, they were deemed not to have any human
                rights.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to paramilitary organisations the
                Human Rights Commission has not done enough work. There have
                been 323 human rights abuses by these organisations, on all
                sides, in the last year, but I have heard no hue and cry from
                the commission about that, nor has it produced an extensive
                document on the matter. The commission has also neglected other
                issues, such as third-party planning appeals. It seems to have
                concentrated its efforts on what it would see as pro-prisoner,
                pro-terrorist and pro-Nationalist programmes. It has not done
                the work it should have been doing. It has not established faith
                among the Unionist community, and I do not believe it has
                established faith within the broader community who find
                terrorist and criminal acts offensive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Human Rights Commission has been on trial
                for the past three years. The funding it has received has been
                on a trial basis. Having been tried, it has been found wanting.
                I cannot therefore support Mr Attwood’s analysis and
                amendment, because the Human Rights Commission has failed —
                and failed miserably.</p>

                I oppose the motion and support the amendment. The motion should
                be seen for what it is — another attempt by Unionists to
                undermine the Good Friday Agreement. They want to purge, in the
                words of Sylvia Hermon, that section on rights, safeguards and
                equality to which they signed up to and now do not like. The
                words &quot;rights&quot; and &quot;equality&quot; are alien to
                the Unionist mindset, but the agreement and the Act put human
                rights at the centre of political, social and economic change on
                this island.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Human Rights Commission has been given
                the specific task of ensuring that that happens. Part of the
                task is to advise the British Government on a bill of rights,
                complementary and additional to the Human Rights Commission,
                which will reflect the particular circumstances of the North.
                After 18 months and six- county-wide consultations with the
                commission, the UUP has suddenly discovered that all sorts of
                people, precisely 67% of Protestants and 88% of Catholics, think
                that the bill of rights it is not only a good idea, but is
                essential.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unionism has never recognised, let alone
                reflected on, the particular circumstances of the North and the
                construction of a state whose very existence depended on
                division, inequality and the abuse of human rights. It is
                precisely because of that, and to address the human rights
                deficit, that Sinn Féin argued strongly that the sections on
                rights, safeguards and equality should ensure that the causes of
                conflict were prioritised and addressed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All parties that signed up to the agreement
                accepted that and affirmed their commitment to mutual respect.
                However, the party that tabled today’s motion has done
                absolutely nothing to confirm its commitment to mutual respect
                and parity of esteem. It has never acknowledged the right to
                self-determination, the only human right for which an explicit
                formulation was agreed in the Good Friday Agreement, which was
                supported in referendums North and South. The motion is about
                trying to change the agreement and the composition of the Human
                Rights Commission because it does not suit the narrow Unionist
                agenda. It is an example of a party on the run: on the run from
                the DUP; on the run from the Human Rights Commission; and on the
                run from the agreement to which it signed up.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is even out of step with its own people.
                They want a bill of rights, and they wish to contribute to it,
                judging by the e-mails that we have received. On 8 May, David
                Trimble, in one of his more lucid periods, said that the core
                principles of human rights and equality are woven into the
                fabric of the agreement and reflected in the Programme for
                Government. However, how do Unionists make progress on those
                core principles? They attack the Human Rights Commission for
                carrying out its remit as laid down in the agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yesterday, the media treated us to the
                unsavoury situation of two parties, the DUP and the UUP,
                scratching around for signatures for a motion to exclude
                democratically elected representatives in order to bring down
                the Assembly. The UUP has the audacity to censure the Human
                Rights Commission. One can see that it may feel the need to
                defend its junior Minister, Dermot Nesbitt, after his outrageous
                outburst at the launch of the consultation document ‘Making a
                Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland’.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The attack on the commission and the outright
                rejection of the consultation document was not lost on the
                audience, which greeted his outburst with a stunned silence. Nor
                was it lost on them that the Minister was using the occasion to
                advance his narrow-minded, bigoted, party political position on
                a bill of rights before it had even got off the ground. I would
                suggest that he resign, but he is going to anyway.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is not the first time that Unionism has
                dismissed efforts to enact a bill of rights here. When the late
                Sheelagh Murnaghan tried to do so in the 1960s, her efforts were
                stonewalled by the same Unionist mindset that is on display
                here. In retrospect, those Unionists might reflect that, had
                they placed a bill of rights on the political agenda then, this
                society might have been spared 30 years of conflict. There are
                many things in the draft document that Sinn Féin will
                challenge, but, overall, the draft pursues a liberal Unionist
                agenda. It is clear from the motion that the Unionists, not
                content with the British Government’s efforts to neutralise
                the commission through lack of powers and resources, want to put
                the commission and the agreement out of business. I oppose the
                motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs E Bell:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I oppose the motion and support the
                amendment. There are several reasons for my opposition, but
                chief among them is my belief that the motion is pointless and
                out of time. My Colleagues in the Ulster Unionist Party have
                expressed concern and reservation that the Human Rights
                Commission has exceeded its authority. They fear that the
                consultation document is too broad and that it covers rights
                that are not particular to Northern Ireland. The Human Rights
                Commission clearly sets out its remit and its approach to
                fulfilling that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the document, the commission quotes
                extensively from the Good Friday Agreement. It then goes on to
                explain various interpretations of Northern Ireland’s
                particular circumstances drawing, as appropriate, on
                international instruments and experience. It further states that
                the interpretation of the Bill should be based on human dignity,
                equality and freedom, without any threat to rights adequately
                protected by law.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After reading the consultation document, I
                can only commend the commission for its frankness. The Human
                Rights Commission does not claim to have the final answer for
                what is meant in paragraph 4 of the Good Friday Agreement about
                exclusive Northern Ireland rights. Instead, it explicitly asks
                for the opinions and reasoning of all people in Northern
                Ireland. The first three questions that it poses are an attempt
                to have us, the people of Northern Ireland, help define its
                remit.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is only right that Members of the Assembly
                would have concerns and disagree with what the commission has
                set forth in its entirety. However, it is no surprise that those
                are the types of opinions that the commission wishes to hear.
                Members should be more effective in lobbying the Human Rights
                Commission about the ways in which it believes that it has
                exceeded its remit and by holding this debate today.
                Fortunately, they can do both. The ad hoc human rights
                consortium that supports a fully inclusive debate on a bill of
                rights is an example of effective lobbying. The consortium
                consists of representatives from over 50 voluntary and community
                groups.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">‘Making a Bill of Rights for Northern
                Ireland’ is merely a consultative document that can be
                changed, and more then likely it will be changed, perhaps as a
                result of this debate. However, I am, on the whole, pleased with
                its contents. Historically, the Alliance Party has supported a
                bill of rights, and I am pleased that it supports the concept of
                proportional representation, which ensures everyone’s right to
                participate in government. For a long time, we have advocated
                that such a bill incorporate international standards, which the
                document does.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Initially, my party was wary that the
                commission would interpret its remit too narrowly and focus
                exclusively on group rights. I am pleased that that has not
                happened. I agree with the reasoning to support the inclusion of
                a section on children’s rights and of strongly worded
                statements on women’s rights. I am sure that the proponents of
                the motion will argue that neither children nor women are unique
                to Northern Ireland, but I counter that with the point that,
                although they are not unique, they have suffered under our
                unique circumstances. For too long their rights, not to mention
                the rights of ethnic minorities, have been at the bottom of
                every agenda.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need a strong bill of rights to address
                those past wrongs and to protect the needs of all communities. I
                oppose the motion for those reasons. The document is for
                consultation; it is not set in stone. The commission is seeking
                our advice, as well as the advice of many others in the
                Province. It acknowledges its remit and explains how and why it
                has interpreted it. In the document, the commission says that
                the final delivery of an effective bill of rights is the concern
                of everyone interested in the search for long-term peace and
                stability in Northern Ireland — the two Governments, the
                political parties, civil society and all the people of Northern
                Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, many of the rights may seem
                universal and may have a particular bearing here. Now is the
                time to try to improve those rights for all in Northern Ireland,
                and not only those in the two perceived communities. I support
                the amendment.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ervine:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie began by assuring us of his belief
                in human rights. He felt the need to repeat that, so he finished
                off by assuring us of his commitment to human rights. What came
                in between was a right-wing rant — right wing in its attitude
                to economics and economic opportunity, and right wing generally.
                It will be interesting to see whether the Ulster Unionist Party
                is the broad church that we are told that it is — Genghis Khan
                elements early, and perhaps a few Joe Stalin elements later.
                However, it seems that we may not see that. I have seen this
                before. It may not have been to do with human rights; it may
                have been to do with socialism or with how economics might be
                dealt with differently in society. The death knell for that was
                sectarianism and a refusal to believe that if you were Unionist
                or Protestant that was anything to do with you. It was a
                Catholic and Republican matter; it was not a matter for ordinary
                citizens.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Reds under the bed&quot; — and I am
                not accusing Dr Birnie of saying that — have been alive and
                well in society for a very long time. I can remember people who
                are now Members of this House branding people as &quot;reds
                under the bed&quot; because they advocated something that was
                different from the style and nature of what they had lived under
                for so long.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie went through the booklet produced
                by the commission and made arguments. Rather than deal with
                those, let me tell him something of which he may or may not be
                aware. I have had the luxury — dubious as it may be — of
                sitting in Committee Rooms here, and I have heard members of the
                Human Rights Commission being interrogated with abject hostility
                by representatives of the Unionist community on all kinds of
                issues. To pick up the document and show your hostility to it
                does not tell the whole truth. There are Members present who
                have been on those Committees and who know that. There was
                abject bitterness and hostility because somehow those people
                were seen to be defending terrorists and sticking their noses in
                where they did not belong.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps we should take ownership of an
                element that would assist our institutions to function more
                practically. In the words of Edwin Poots, the Unionist community
                has had no ownership of this. Why has it had no ownership? What
                are we afraid of? Are we afraid to defend a human being’s
                right? Are Protestants and Unionists not human beings? What is
                there to be frightened about? That is a sign of the insecurity
                that permeates our society, an insecurity that is not in the
                first instance proffered to us by our enemy. It is proffered to
                us often in the first instance by our leadership: be afraid of
                this; be afraid of that; be afraid of the dark. It will be
                difficult to see a human rights system here that works properly,
                because I do not imagine that a sterling job can be done by the
                commission, given the pathetic amount of money that it has been
                allocated.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It seems that all Prods are clairvoyant —
                and there is never any good news. They are afraid of the dark
                and rather than switch on the light — take ownership of
                something and be part of it, so that it would be the way that
                they wanted it to be — they run away from it. That is what is
                happening today. The refusal to allow or encourage the Unionist
                community to take ownership of the Human Rights Commission makes
                it difficult for all of us to sell the concept of human rights.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Member from one of the parties — he is
                not in the Chamber now — once said that there should be no
                such thing as human rights legislation in Northern Ireland.
                Perhaps, he reflects more accurately the feelings of Members on
                those Benches. We shall hear some strange stuff in the next
                half-hour about how people think that they are so decent as
                regards human rights.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also concerned about some earlier
                comments. Mr Edwin Poots’s remarks about giving blood reminded
                me what giving blood was all about. Members who gave blood here
                last year will know that people give it because they know that,
                some day, someone will need it — not because they expect to
                get it back automatically. Perhaps that also applies to human
                rights. To have proper regard for human rights means that we
                should enshrine in law something from which we may not
                necessarily benefit, but which other people — Unionist or
                Nationalist — need. That is a better way to talk about giving
                blood than the disgraceful comments made by the Member for Lagan
                Valley about the rights of gays and lesbians.</p>

                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will not give way. The Member had an
                opportunity to clarify his point after he made it. It is
                shameful that a Member should make such a comment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The speech made by the mover of the motion
                made me despair. He calls himself an economist, while arguing
                that Northern Ireland is doing so well that we no longer have to
                concern ourselves with our deprivation and poverty rates,
                because they are coming into line with those in the rest of the
                United Kingdom. Reports produced by agencies such as the
                Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA)
                repeatedly state that, given the proportion of children in the
                Northern Ireland population, our poverty rates far exceed those
                elsewhere. Did we not hear Sir Reg Empey refer to that yesterday
                when he introduced the draft Programme for Government? We must
                take account of the fact that we have fallen so far behind. It
                is good for us to enshrine rights that deal with economic and
                social deprivation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie may have received the same faxes as
                I did from Save the Children, from the Multicultural Resource
                Centre, from Barnardo’s, from Women in Politics and from
                Amnesty International. All those organisations expressed concern
                about the idea that we should have anything to fear from the
                wide-ranging consultation carried out by the Human Rights
                Commission, and they restated their support for the commission.
                Despite a lack of resources, the Human Rights Commission had to
                encourage other organisations to set up their own discussions on
                human rights. It welcomed that opportunity. For some reason, Dr
                Birnie said that it was not good for the Human Rights Commission
                to be involved in campaigning and debating and that its role was
                purely consultative. Does it not enrich our civic life to have a
                commission involved in campaigning for and debating a bill of
                rights?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These are good days for Northern Ireland —
                despite the depressing and distressing scenes that one sees on
                the streets. In the future, Members will be able to tell their
                children — if not their grandchildren — that they were
                involved when the country was drawing up a bill of rights. How
                many people in history have had that wonderful opportunity?
                However, Members are denying that opportunity to the communities
                and are saying that the Human Rights Commission should not have
                bothered campaigning and debating something as important as the
                rights of a country’s people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie also said that the commission stirs
                up extraordinary expectations. We have had an extraordinary
                past, and it is little wonder that people have raised themselves
                to have a vision of a different future. They will not be
                disappointed. If people have been involved in the discussions
                and take ownership of those discussions, they know that it will
                be a win-win situation. They know that they will have to give
                something when the bill of rights is decided.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Did those Members who criticised so loudly
                make submissions during the previous consultation, and do they
                intend to do so following the current round?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission
                was doomed from the moment the basic human rights of Unionists
                were denied in the selection and appointment of its members.
                Excellently qualified candidates with no Unionist political
                associations, senior solicitors in mixed partnerships and
                university lecturers of consummate intelligence were set aside
                for others of questionable competence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For Ulster Unionists to complain that the
                Human Rights Commission has failed to discharge its remit under
                the agreement is another example of pro-agreement selective
                amnesia, which affects so many of those who negotiated and
                signed it. The commission’s mandate and remit clearly states
                that its duty is to constitute a bill of rights for Northern
                Ireland. That is similar to the Ulster Unionists’ attitude to
                Patten: when the outcome does not suit them they deny that they
                granted the remit that brought about the mischief.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is pointless to complain about the job
                that the commission has made of its remit when the basic fault
                is the existence of the remit. A bill of rights for Northern
                Ireland means provincial human rights for Northern Ireland that
                do not apply to our fellow citizens in the rest of the United
                Kingdom.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The concept of provincial human rights
                violates two basic principles. First, there is the equality of
                citizenship. The rights and duties of all citizens in the United
                Kingdom should be equal. Secondly, human rights are universal.
                Their very claim to special privilege in law is that they apply
                to all human beings, and across all provincial and national
                boundaries. Universality is the fundamental basis of human
                rights.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposals set out in the commission’s
                draft bill of rights would move Northern Ireland further out of
                the United Kingdom than it already is, and that outcome should
                have been foreseen by those in the Ulster Unionist Party who
                negotiated and signed the Belfast Agreement. The fact that they
                did not foresee that means that they stand condemned as
                incompetent negotiators.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission
                and other non-statutory bodies who work in the same field have a
                case to answer, because their efforts to protect human rights
                almost exclusively focus on the state, in all its aspects, as
                the primary source of human rights violations.</p>

                between competing human rights. They draw no distinction between
                the right to silence and the right to life. Those groups have
                taken what some might unkindly characterise as the human rights
                industry and almost completely failed to respond to the growing
                trend in the real world of citizens’ human rights being
                violated by non-state bodies. The Home Secretary, Mr Blunkett,
                recently said that human rights will have to take second place
                to the security of life and the security of the state. The
                commission has almost entirely ignored the violation of human
                rights by non-state bodies — paramilitaries and their
                increasing band of criminal auxiliaries. That state of affairs
                might be characterised as the privatisation of human rights
                violations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is little short of a scandal that the
                commission and others have little to say about, and devote a
                small proportion of their resources to doing something about,
                the punishment beatings, intimidation, extortion, robberies and
                organised fraud conducted by paramilitary groups — some of
                whose frontmen and frontwomen sit in the Assembly and enjoy
                Executive office.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I listened to a farrago of bitterness and a
                myopic view of the commission’s report from Mrs Nelis. She
                represents a party that is inextricably linked to a paramilitary
                organisation that has committed some of the most inhuman,
                horrible and outrageous violations of human rights, yet she has
                the brass neck to come here and lecture other citizens who
                belong to democratic parties about how they should behave.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Human Rights Commission should start to
                address the real issues. Those are the violations of the most
                fundamental human rights: the right to live; the right to bring
                up children in peace; and the right to have personal integrity
                from violent personal injury.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion put forward by my
                Colleague Dr Birnie, not because I am opposed to human rights
                — as suggested by one Sinn Féin Member — and not because
                Unionism is afraid of human rights. I have had an interest in
                human rights for many years. I studied the subject at
                university, and I continue to maintain an interest.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am a firm believer in human rights. I
                believe in equal political and civil rights for all citizens in
                the United Kingdom, throughout the European Union and the world.
                I want to see those rights protected. However, I am concerned
                that the new Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission has not
                been doing that. It has not been fulfilling its remit. Instead,
                it has tried to create some kind of social engineering document
                in order to put forward a ’60s-style socialist view of
                society. The commission wants to try to impose that view on the
                rest of us and take away the decisions that we are supposed to
                make about political life from political instruments such as the
                Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the right of women to choose
                whether to have an abortion, and I support the right to same-sex
                marriage. However, those issues should not be contained in a
                bill of rights. They are political issues. They are issues on
                which one makes a political decision in the political
                institutions that we have set up. They are issues for us to
                argue, not to be laid down in a bill of rights to be discussed
                and ruled on by courts. That is not the appropriate way with
                which to deal with those issues. They are not the subjects of
                fundamental human rights; they are political decisions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In some ways I would like to distance myself
                from the remarks that Mr Poots made, as I am uncomfortable with
                them, but, at the same time, he reflected a view that is held in
                the Unionist community. The Human Rights Commission has
                singularly failed to promote an awareness of human rights
                culture and of human rights in the Unionist community. As Mr
                McCartney said, that happened because the then Secretary of
                State took no regard of her legal duty to appoint a commission
                that fully reflected the community, and instead appointed from
                within the human rights lobby or industry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is a great shame and has been the
                disaster that has underpinned much of what the Human Rights
                Commission has tried to do since — and this is where I
                disagree with Mr McCartney. The remit that was given to the
                commission in the Belfast Agreement was not to draw up a bill of
                rights, but</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;to consult and advise on the scope for
                defining, in Westminster legislation, rights supplementary to
                those in the European Convention on Human Rights, to reflect the
                particular circumstances of Northern Ireland.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Its job is to advise and consult on
                supplementary rights. Although the European Convention has not
                been incorporated, its remedies are available to UK citizens
                through the Human Rights Act 1998. That was probably one of the
                major pieces of legislation to go through Westminster since the
                European Communities Act 1972. It represents a significant
                change in the way in which the legal system in the United
                Kingdom will operate. It has an effect on Northern Ireland and
                has done so since October 2000.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whenever the Human Rights Commission thinks
                it is relevant, it will mention the Human Rights Act 1998, but
                it does not look at the Act. It does not take account of the
                effect that the 1998 Act has had, and instead runs off to
                produce a completely separate document.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Human Rights Commission was supposed to
                ask what extra rights and protections were necessary to meet
                Northern Ireland’s particular circumstances. The answer to
                that question could be that no additional rights to those in the
                European Convention are needed. The commission could have
                concluded that the European Convention on Human Rights was
                sufficient to protect the political and civil rights of Northern
                Ireland people as part of the United Kingdom, and through the
                protections offered to them by the 1998 Act. The commission did
                not do that. It said that it had been given a remit to produce a
                bill of rights and that that is what it would do. It produced an
                astounding, incredible document that has no precedent in
                international law.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My other concern is that, in producing the
                document, the commission has significantly alienated the
                Unionist community. Instead of being able to embrace human
                rights culture and look at human rights as offering protection
                for the Unionist culture, the Unionist community has been
                alienated by the commission’s course of action. What is the
                commission doing about the difficult issues, such as the right
                to assemble? Human rights are not about protecting the rights
                that one particularly favours; it is about protecting all
                rights, which include those on difficult issues with which one
                may not agree. If someone wishes to produce fascist or racist
                work he has a right to do that, and that right should be
                defended. I may not agree with such people but their right to
                express their opinions has to be protected. That is also true
                when it comes to the right to peaceful assembly. The commission
                has simply invented rights to try and oppose what should be
                protected.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Lewsley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the amendment. The Northern Ireland
                Human Rights Commission, which derives its mandate from the Good
                Friday Agreement, is fundamentally important. Without the
                commission, the agreement’s vision of a new beginning for
                Northern Ireland based on human rights for all cannot be
                realised.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is all the more regrettable that the
                commission has not been given the budget and powers commensurate
                with its importance under the agreement. The SDLP welcomes
                recent improvements in the commission’s budget but regrets the
                time that that has taken and the detrimental effect that that
                has had on the commission’s ability to engage with wider civic
                society on the bill of rights. Our party also regrets the lack
                of powers given to the Human Rights Commission.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The commission recently reviewed its powers
                and effectiveness, and made detailed recommendations to the
                Secretary of State. However, the review makes for sad reading.
                It shows that, in the past two years, the Northern Ireland
                Office and criminal justice agencies have been able to stymie
                the commission’s investigations through non-co-operation. It
                also shows how the commission has been powerless in the face of
                such obstruction, despite assurances at Westminster by the then
                Secretary of State, MoMowlam, that legislation would provide for
                full co-operation. Those assurances have not been honoured. That
                is why the SDLP has called for the commission’s powers to be
                greatly enhanced. We have made it clear that the commission
                should enjoy the same extensive powers as those enjoyed by the
                Irish Human Rights Commission. Nothing less will bring our
                commission into line with the principles on the status and
                functioning of national institutions for protection and
                promotion of human rights known as the Paris Principles. Nothing
                less will do.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The SDLP has proposed an amendment to the
                motion to highlight the commission’s lack of powers and to
                call for those defects to be remedied. The Secretary of State
                has been considering a review of the commission’s powers, but
                he has not responded yet. We await his acceptance of the
                commission’s recommendations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Despite all of this, the Human Rights
                Commission has discharged its mandate admirably. That can be
                clearly seen in the bill of rights.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Good Friday Agreement states that the
                commission must consult and advise on the scope of defining
                rights supplementary to the European Convention on Human Rights.
                The commission is doing that. It has consulted; it has produced
                draft advice; and it is consulting on that advice. The agreement
                says that the commission should draw on &quot;international
                instruments and experience.&quot; It has done so by examining
                countless international instruments. The agreement also says
                that the commission should</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;reflect the particular circumstances of
                Northern Ireland&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has accomplished that by laying emphasis
                on economic and social rights. Those rights can form the basis
                of a common agenda that can heal the divisions in Northern
                Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If there is one thing that the commission has
                not done, it is to make sufficiently strong provision for parity
                of esteem, and just and equal treatment for the identity, ethos
                and aspirations of both communities. The SDLP considers that a
                fundamental issue, because it is fundamental to the agreement
                itself. We would have wished for clearer provision for that
                matter, in order to reflect the agreement better. To base the
                rights on the Framework Convention for the Protection of
                National Minorities is not enough. The agreement, itself an
                international instrument, goes further by guaranteeing the equal
                treatment of both communities’ aspirations, as opposed to
                merely their cultural identities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The higher protection of rights given by the
                agreement deserves clearer recognition. However, this is just a
                consultation paper. It is no surprise that we, or any other
                party, should comment on it. It does not mean that the Human
                Rights Commission has not carried out its duties under the
                agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is regrettable that Unionist politicians
                have engaged in a negative debate on the commission. That is
                based on a complete misunderstanding of the issues. For example,
                I have heard complaints that some Unionists believe that the
                principle of consent should be included in the bill of rights
                —</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many people will find it odd that the Ulster
                Unionist Party complained last week about the Patten Report. It
                said that its members on the board would not be bound by Patten
                and the police legislation, because it was not what they
                understood would be in the agreement. At the start of the week,
                the UUP drew up a motion, which has yet to be put before the
                House, to exclude Sinn Féin, because it had been conned on the
                issue of letting terrorists into Government with their guns.
                Today the party tells us that it has been conned about the
                Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission. To get it wrong once
                is bad, twice is disastrous, but a third time is criminal.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those people said that they had negotiated a
                good agreement, and they sold it to the people of Northern
                Ireland on that basis. Today’s motion, which we shall be
                supporting, is a sad indictment of the job that was done when
                the Belfast Agreement was signed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those who oppose the motion have not dealt
                with the essence of the complaints that were made. Instead, they
                have pointed the finger and implied that anyone who supports the
                motion is against human rights.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I listened to David Ervine’s remarks. All
                his attention was directed at the Unionist Benches. I did not
                stay to listen to the regular rant from Mary Nelis, but I can
                guess what she said about human rights. The organisation with
                which she is identified is totally immersed in a culture of
                denial of human rights. However, the House did not hear one word
                about that hypocrisy from David Ervine. All his ire was directed
                at those who support the motion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given the commission’s remit and
                membership, did anyone really expect anything more than a
                liberal-left, politically correct, Nationalist-driven agenda? As
                one commentator remarked, the commission was Mo Mowlam’s
                parting two fingers to the Unionist community. According to a
                parliamentary answer, six members of the commission were members
                of the Committee on the Administration of Justice (CAJ), a
                Nationalist front organisation. What else can be expected from
                that? We have seen its actions here.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Human Rights Commission has become the
                voice of the villain. Its representatives appeared before the
                Assembly to talk about extra powers for the police to
                investigate the financial irregularities of criminals. Without
                even having seen the code of practice — the commission
                admitted that it had not seen it — they recommended that it
                needed changing to protect the criminal.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There have been complaints about the
                commission’s lack of money. However, there was no lack of
                money when it came to protecting the Omagh bombers. The
                commission has taken two cases to court. One action sought to
                protect the identities of the Omagh bombers from being broadcast
                on ‘Panorama’. The other case went to the High Court to
                enhance the powers of the commission and allow it to intervene
                in third-party cases.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What we have seen from the Northern Ireland
                Human Rights Commission, which the document shows, is a desire
                to extend its powers. For example, if someone complains that a
                hospital or school closure impinges on his or her human rights,
                the commission wants the power to take such a case to court and
                for the judge to overrule decisions made by elected Members of
                the Assembly. In fact, at a recent meeting to discuss extra
                powers, the commission wanted powers to enter properties, seize
                documents, and so on. It wanted to become another Special
                Branch, only with more powers. It is right not to give the
                commission extra powers. The one way to put a rein on the
                commission is to use an economic stranglehold and not give it
                any more money.</p>

                We must question the reason behind the motion and its timing,
                given that the consultation process on the bill of rights is
                ongoing. The consultation process, which was launched in March
                2000, has seen 11 different pamphlets distributed. Nine
                independent advisory groups were set up, 400 educators were
                trained, and educational videos and manuals were produced. The
                commission invited independent speakers, who included the
                president of the Constitutional Court of South Africa. A total
                of 230 submissions have been received, and 22 public meetings
                have taken place.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given all that, why did the Ulster Unionist
                Party not raise its concerns and contribute to that process?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No, I have only five minutes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It makes one wonder whether Unionists are
                using the motion not only to attack the commission, but to
                renegotiate the Good Friday Agreement and to produce a
                commission that they can influence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Good Friday Agreement envisaged a
                far-reaching bill of rights that extended protection beyond the
                two communities to cover all communities, including ethnic
                minorities. It was to cover rights that would reflect and
                address the North of Ireland’s particular circumstances. Those
                rights include socio-economic rights, children’s rights, the
                rights of the elderly and women’s rights. Furthermore, it was
                to be a free-standing bill of rights that built on, and went
                further than, international instruments. It is pertinent to ask
                just what Unionists are afraid of. Human rights are not about
                Nationalist or Unionist rights; they are about the rights of
                every single individual in this society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The amendment, which my party is supporting,
                states that the commission has been hindered in discharging its
                remit due to limits on its powers and resources. That is
                absolutely correct. It has been stated here — in a different
                way, of course — that the commission is not representative.
                Yes, it is not representative. Catholics, women and Nationalists
                are under-represented, and there are no representatives from the
                ethnic minorities, from people with disabilities or from the gay
                and lesbian community — in fact, from all the groups covered
                by section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The draft bill of rights produced by the
                commission does not go far enough. It fails, for example, to
                recognise specifically the rights of political ex-prisoners. The
                British Government failed to fund the Human Rights Commission
                adequately at an early stage. The commission has been unable to
                function effectively because it has been undermined from the
                start by lack of resources and by the failure of the British
                Government to give it the necessary powers, such as those of
                subpoena and discovery.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The commission was further curtailed by Lord
                Justice Carswell’s finding that it did not have the powers to
                intervene in cases as a third party, or amicus curiae. The
                British Government have failed to legislate to give those powers
                to the Human Rights Commission, powers similar to those held by
                other non-governmental organisations. Indeed, the commission is
                not governed by the Paris Principles, the guidelines followed by
                all human rights organisations throughout the world.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Secretary of State has still not acted on
                the commission’s report of February 2001 despite that report’s
                recommendations on the changes required to improve its
                effectiveness.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Much more needs to be done in the field of
                human rights, particularly regarding the representativeness of
                the Human Rights Commission. However, we must applaud the
                commission’s work so far, despite its inadequacies and lack of
                resources.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most of Mr Poots comments were disgraceful,
                but those concerning blood donations, in particular, were
                shameful to the House. It was an attack on people who suffer
                from AIDS, haemophilia and hepatitis. Unfortunately, that is
                indicative of the backward thinking among so many people in this
                society.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Armstrong:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Everyone is entitled to human rights, but
                things have to be fair and equal. The Northern Ireland Human
                Rights Commission has failed to propose recommendations in line
                with its remit. The Belfast Agreement charged the commission
                with advising and consulting with the UK Government on
                additional human rights, which could be introduced by law to
                further safeguard the identity and ethos of both communities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The commission has done its bit in keeping
                open the constitutional debate by mentioning Northern Ireland’s
                competing and equally legitimate aspirations. The commission has
                been set up by the British Government and must provide society
                with equal human rights for all people in Northern Ireland in
                the context of the United Kingdom. The consultation document
                mentions self-determination, but not the principle of consent,
                which was endorsed under the Belfast Agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The bill of rights aims to promote mutual
                tolerance and respect among all sections of the community.
                However, the commission fails to be pragmatic about the reality.
                A bill of rights will not remove the main threat to human rights
                that prevails in our society — that posed by Sinn Féin/IRA,
                which still holds on to arms.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report also deals with the rights of
                young people. The House will know that the main threat to them
                comes from bully boys whose actions are directed by paramilitary
                organisations. The commission fails to mention that. Our young
                people need to be adequately protected by law from punishment
                beatings and from drug pushers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regarding the issue of job equality, the best
                person should get the job. We must safeguard an employer’s
                right to choose the type of person that he wants to employ. That
                is not sufficiently recognised by the bill of rights’
                recommendations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The document spent much time stressing past
                crimes of the state in dealing with terrorist violence. However,
                a vital omission from the document is that the state has a
                legitimate monopoly in the use of force. That principle defines
                a state. Safeguards must be adhered to. However, the state’s
                hands must not be tied in discharging its legitimate function of
                ensuring law and order.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Human Rights Commission has not
                safeguarded the culture of the majority of the population. It is
                now politically incorrect for people of my culture to celebrate
                or express beliefs. That was not addressed. Human rights are
                weak on that issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Human Rights Commission has proven to be
                spineless, with a false view of our world. Our world is not
                ideal, and it is futile to think that the commission can create
                a perfect society. It has failed to adopt a balanced approach to
                the establishment of human rights. It has undermined many
                valuable traditional institutions in our society, which include
                the sanctity of marriage. Its view is contrary to the distinct
                nature of Northern Ireland’s society. Therefore the commission
                has ignored its remit and offered a series of proposals that
                would offend most people in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I realise that the rights of the minority
                should be protected. However, in its efforts to please the
                minority, the commission has forgotten about the majority.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even by the House’s standards, this has
                been one of the most dispiriting and disappointing debates to
                date. I hope to enliven it and raise the standard a little bit.
                I was deeply depressed by the speeches from the Unionist
                Benches. David Ervine went to the heart of the issue: the
                Unionist parties, and sadly the Ulster Unionist Party in
                particular, seem to have no confidence in human rights. They
                seem to have a negative reaction to human rights. They see it as
                the preserve of the Nationalist, Republican or Catholic
                community — something that does not belong to them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, that is not reflected in the
                community. I refer, in particular, to the Protestant community.
                Some 215 organisations ranging from Age Concern to the
                Tullyalley Community Association contributed to the Human Rights
                Commission’s deliberations. Those organisations reflect a wide
                spectrum of Northern Ireland society. Ordinary people in the
                Unionist or Protestant community have a belief in human rights
                and have confidence in the Human Rights Commission. I cannot
                understand why a party that is committed to the Good Friday
                Agreement cannot embrace the concept of human rights and support
                the body that has been set up to advance human rights in
                Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am told that the Human Rights Commission
                has gone outside its terms of reference. The terms state, as Mr
                McCartney — and I notice he never stays to the end of the

                to those in the European Convention on Human Rights, to reflect
                the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland, drawing as
                appropriate on international instruments and experience. These
                additional rights to reflect the principles of mutual respect
                for the identity and ethos of both communities and parity of
                esteem, and — taken together with the ECHR — to constitute a
                Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland.&quot;</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I cannot see how the commission has gone
                outside its terms of reference. The Human Rights Commission has
                faithfully discharged its duty under its terms of reference. It
                has produced a draft bill of human rights for people’s
                considerations. It is a consultative document; there is nothing
                here that the document says must be included in the bill of
                rights. The Human Rights Commission is providing its own
                suggestions, as well as those from a wide range of organisations
                and people in the community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is wrong with that? How can that offend
                anybody in the Chamber, Unionist or Nationalist? The Human
                Rights Commission has discharged its duties very well on a
                budget of £750,000, which is chicken feed in comparison to the
                figures that other public organisations funded by the Northern
                Ireland Office receive. The Police Ombudsman and other
                organisations receive much more than that. The commission is
                strapped for funds, and it needs additional funding. Its funding
                should be between £1·5 million and £2 million per year. If
                the commission were given that sort of funding, it could
                discharge its duties much better. The Human Rights Commission
                rightly pointed out that it is underfunded and that it does not
                have sufficient powers. Its powers and its independence do not
                reflect the Paris Principles, which are internationally
                recognised as the minimum requirements.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the many weird criticisms that Dr
                Birnie made of the commission was that it had a maximalist
                approach to human rights. Why would it not take that approach?
                If it had a minimalist approach to human rights, it would be
                failing in its duty.</p>

                would say such a thing and suggests to me that that person is
                pathological in her attitude towards another community in the
                North. That attitude is manifest in the failure of both Sinn
                Féin Members who spoke today to accept the invitation from the
                Unionist Members to comment on abuses of human rights that
                emanate from the Republican movement and community. Their
                silence and lack of response on that reveals much about those
                who criticise the Unionist approach to human rights, a criticism
                which, in many ways, I share.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney stated that the Human Rights
                Commission</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;has almost entirely ignored the

                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney almost entirely ignored the
                activities of the Human Rights Commission. As well as its
                intervention on behalf of the Omagh families, it made
                submissions to the Ad Hoc Committee on the draft Proceeds of
                Crime Bill 2001 and expressed views on the proposed Financial
                Investigations (Northern Ireland) Order 2001, both of which are
                attempts to purge our community of the effects of organised
                crime. It has made comments to the House of Commons Northern
                Ireland Affairs Committee on the relocation of victims of
                paramilitary intimidation. It has contributed to the
                International Council on Human Rights Policy report on
                human-rights approaches to armed groups. The portrayal of the
                Human Rights Commission as a body that entirely ignores
                non-state abuses is contradicted by many of its activities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Duncan Shipley Dalton said that there was no
                need to go beyond the Human Rights Act 1998, which incorporated
                the European Convention on Human Rights into domestic law. That
                view may be valid. However, that was not the mandate given to
                the Human Rights Commission. Page 16, paragraph 4, of the Good
                Friday Agreement explicitly says that the commission should
                consider</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;rights supplementary to those of the
                European Convention on Human rights, to reflect the particular
                circumstances of Northern Ireland&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It then adds</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;These additional rights to reflect the
                principles of mutual respect for the identity and ethos of both
                communities and parity of esteem&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That explicitly goes beyond the European
                Convention on Human Rights. Given that the Good Friday Agreement
                gives a mandate to move beyond the European Convention on Human
                Rights, the commission is quite right to do so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The implementation of human rights in the
                North is an opportunity, not a threat. We hear from the Unionist
                Benches that it is considered a threat, not an opportunity. The
                Unionists should heed what Monica McWilliams said about the
                growing volume of opinion in the North and heed too those who
                are articulating the need for human rights — the Northern
                Ireland Public Service Alliance, Save the Children, Women into
                Politics, Amnesty International, the Multi-Cultural Resource
                Centre (Northern Ireland) and the many organisations that gave
                submissions during the consultation process on a bill of rights.
                They are representative of the Northern Ireland community. Many
                of their members may also be Unionists, Nationalists, Loyalists
                or Republicans, but they all can see that the new civic religion
                in our society, and in many societies around the world, is the
                issue of human rights. They are embracing them, and it is time
                for us to do the same.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to thank all who participated in
                the debate, especially the junior Minister, who had the
                difficult task of speaking about something for which he does not
                have responsibility.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As time is tight, I will not attempt a
                point-by-point rebuttal, tempting though it would be. However,
                the second Sinn Féin Member to speak, Dr O’Hagan, implied
                that my party had failed to make a submission to the commission.
                If you look at page 154 of the document you will see that we are
                listed there.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In listening to some of the comments this
                afternoon, particularly from those Members speaking against the
                motion or, indeed, in favour of the amendment, I rather think
                that some such persons were adopting a position similar to that
                adopted by a former British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Ken
                Clarke. In 1993, he urged Members of Parliament to vote for the
                Maastricht Treaty, but he then went on to admit, quite candidly,
                that he had never read the document. We have read this document,
                and in it, and, indeed, in what has been said this afternoon, we
                have not found evidence that the commission would have lacked,
                or would now lack, resources if it had stuck to its defined
                remit as stated in the Belfast Agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have not heard evidence to counter the
                crucial point that many social and economic rights, desirable
                though they may be as objectives, cannot be justiciable. Poverty
                cannot be abolished by a decision in court. It needs public
                spending, a sound economic policy and a productive economy —
                all very important items — but it cannot be solved by a human
                rights document. That is not, to use Mr Ervine’s allegation, a
                piece of so-called right-wing rant. It is a sound philosophical
                argument, supported internationally by many commentators on
                human rights.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Has the Human Rights Commission gone beyond
                the agreement? Yes, it has. It is condemned out of its own
                mouth. On page 14 of the September document, the commission says</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;In so far as a narrow interpretation of
                paragraph 4&quot; —</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">that is of the section in the agreement —</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;might be thought to rule out the
                recommendation of certain rights, the Commission is satisfied
                that it can properly rely on its general power under section
                69(3)(b) of the Northern Ireland Act 1998&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It therefore argues, to my mind not
                convincingly, that it cannot simply rely on the agreement — it
                relies on the Northern Ireland Act 1998. That is clearly a case
                of going beyond the agreement. I repeat what I said — we are
                not against rights per se; we simply want full implementation of
                the agreement in this regard, as in others.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I listened closely to Mr Attwood’s
                summing-up speech. In closing, he got very euphoric and referred
                to the rights agenda as &quot;the civic religion&quot;. At least
                we agreed on that, as I referred to it as &quot;a secular
                religion&quot;. Let us put it to the test. If this really is
                what the people of Northern Ireland want, let it be tested by a
                referendum. However, I note that there is a suggestion that the
                bill of rights should not be approved by a referendum, although,
                to be fair, I have not heard that from the commission. I heard
                it from other lobby groups. I suspect the reason for it is that
                they know a majority of people in Northern Ireland would not
                vote for many of the suggestions within such a document as this.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion, and, contrary to some
                rumours that I have been hearing over lunchtime, I hope that we
                will move rapidly to a vote on it rather than have a so-called
                stay of execution for perhaps six days. The matter is
                sufficiently important to be voted on now, on its own merits,
                without resort to a procedural fig leaf.</p>

                General for Electricity and Gas to contribute to the eradication
                of fuel poverty by increasing the energy efficiency levy to
                £5·00 per customer, creating £3· 6 million to tackle fuel
                poverty.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This motion will have more immediate
                practical effect on the citizens of Northern Ireland than the
                one we have just debated, so I trust Members will move quickly
                to a vote. For those who have not been subject to the effective
                and competent lobbying which many of us have experienced during
                recent weeks, I will explain the workings of the energy
                efficiency levy. For many it is something that gets lost in our
                electricity bills.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The levy is funded from electricity bills at
                the rate of £2 per consumer. To date, it has achieved £3·4
                million, which has been used towards addressing energy
                efficiency and fuel poverty matters. It has been calculated to
                produce benefits of around £29 million for the neediest in
                society, which is an effective rate of return, given what
                happens in most areas of Government expenditure. Two thirds of
                the expenditure has been directly targeted towards the fuel poor
                and has probably achieved a reduction in the region of 137
                kilotonnes of carbon.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Northern Ireland there are around 170,000
                households that suffer from fuel poverty. It is a major issue,
                and there is much to be done. We have evidence that the
                regulator wishes to increase the levy, subject to political
                support. That support should be registered today in the
                Assembly. The regulator proposes that the levy be increased to
                £5 per annum for each consumer, which amounts to less than 6p
                each per week. This is not a significant sum for an individual,
                and the benefits have already been proven.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The extra £2 million that might be raised
                will be targeted towards perhaps as many as 80% of the fuel
                poor, which could save in excess of £20 million, and perhaps as
                much as £22 million, per annum. This is a significant amount of
                money.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although I am a mere Opposition Back-Bencher,
                I must remind the Members of the four largest parties of their
                commitments to the Programme for Government. This will help to
                meet UK national targets on fuel poverty and cut greenhouse
                gases. In Great Britain the levy is £1·80, rather than our
                £2. An immediate increase to £3·60 has been proposed, with a
                further phased increase to £4·80. An increase to £5 might
                follow. The effect on consumers will be minimal compared to the
                benefits.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Suggestions have been made about how what is
                a good scheme could be improved. The idea is that more money
                should be channelled towards total fuel poverty schemes. We have
                seen examples of small ACE schemes in the past, which carried
                out limited insulation work. Some grants were available, but
                there was a piecemeal approach. The concept of dealing with
                every aspect of a household’s fuel poverty, from insulation to
                improving heating sources, must be realised to ensure that those
                in need benefit from the scheme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a need to improve existing
                structures. There are too many small schemes which, no matter
                how willing their workers, do not have the benefits of economies
                of scale and cannot work across the client groups.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we could improve the management of
                schemes, we would, doubtless, see even more benefit. The Office
                for the Regulation of Electricity and Gas (OFREG) must take a
                lead in discussions about how to monitor the effectiveness of
                schemes and improve the use of the energy efficiency levy.
                Already, there is a payback that amounts to nine times the
                original expenditure. Neighbourhood Energy Action and other
                groups estimate that there could be a further increase and
                suggest that we could improve existing schemes and produce
                additional resources.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some Members expressed concern about the
                content of the motion, and an amendment has been proposed.
                Members feel that there is a problem with the existing scheme
                because there is a flat-rate charge. There is a strong argument
                that anything that is, in effect, a tax ought to be progressive,
                so that those who can afford it pay more, and those who cannot
                afford it pay less. However, we must recognise the reality of
                the current scheme. The money is collected by Northern Ireland
                Electricity (NIE). Each consumer pays the same levy, regardless
                of ability to pay, and there is no administration charge for
                raising the money; given that we are all likely to criticise NIE
                later on, we should at least record that fact. We must ensure
                that the money that is raised is used for its intended purposes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has been argued that if we pass the
                motion, we will let the Executive off the hook, since the
                Executive have to fund such schemes. The Executive fund other
                related areas of work — for example, through the Housing
                Executive budget — and I do not oppose the idea of an increase
                in the budget given to the Housing Executive to improve the
                services that it provides. We are working with limited
                resources, but an increase in the levy would provide additional
                money for the Department of Finance and Personnel.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also argued that if the motion were to
                be passed, we would let NIE off the hook. I could engage
                cheerfully in happy populism, telling everyone about what a
                dreadful bunch of wicked capitalists NIE are, and about how they
                got the industry cheap and take too much money. However, there
                is no mechanism — short of primary legislation, which might
                well be struck down by human rights legislation — through
                which the Assembly could enforce such a levy. The existing
                energy efficiency levy can be increased, and, instead of
                demanding pie in the sky, we should find a realistic way in
                which to improve the scheme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I discussed the amendment with the proposer.
                I am not sure whether the Ulster Hospital is wired up to receive
                Assembly television; if it is, Jim Wells will be watching and
                criticising me. I send him my good wishes. The amendment, which
                differs from what Mr Wells and I discussed last week, could
                wreck the existing scheme. I do not believe that that was Jim
                Wells’s intention, and I do not believe that that should be
                the intention of the House.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If Members wish to table a further motion
                relating to NIE’s profits and how they might be applied for
                the public good, they should put it before the House, and we can
                discuss its merits. However, we should not wreck the current
                scheme just to make a political point about our concerns about
                NIE.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the regulator gave evidence to the
                Enterprise, Trade and Investment Committee, he said that he was
                looking for a lead from the Assembly on the energy efficiency
                levy. In GB there is a similar levy which is about to be
                significantly increased from £1·80 to £4·80 in two stages.
                We should give the lead that Mr McIldoon has asked for. We
                should match the GB picture by increasing our levy from £2 to
                £5. We should pass the motion unamended and then look at
                further ways of improving the situation of the 170,000
                households that still need our help.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I beg to move the following amendment: Delete
                all after &quot;poverty&quot; and insert:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;by entering into negotiations with
                Northern Ireland Electricity to obtain additional funding
                equivalent to the amount which would be generated by the
                proposed increase in the energy efficiency levy to £5·00 per
                customer.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I listened carefully to the points made by
                the mover of the motion. Indeed, he succeeded in putting forward
                most of the arguments against his motion. He disposed of the
                arguments with varying degrees of success, although I do not
                feel he did so convincingly. All in the House will agree that
                fuel poverty is an extremely important issue. That is the first
                thing that must be said.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department for Social Development and the
                Housing Executive, as the home energy conservation authority,
                have a programme in place to tackle the issue of fuel poverty.
                We have debated this issue on previous occasions, and we are
                well aware of the fact that 170,000 households in the community
                suffer from fuel poverty. We are also aware that it has been
                estimated that upwards of 600 people each year are dying as a
                result. That is a deplorable situation. Therefore the issue of
                fuel poverty is crucial, and we must address it. It is simply
                intolerable that 600 people are dying each year in Northern
                Ireland from cold-related illnesses.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We, the consumers across the Province, are
                currently paying the highest prices for electricity anywhere in
                Europe. When NIE announced a few months ago that it was
                increasing electricity prices by about 9%, there was rightly
                outrage across the House in all quarters about the swingeing
                increases in electricity tariffs. Having already been subjected
                to high increases and already paying the highest prices in
                Europe, our consumers are being faced once again with a massive
                increase.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of the reasons behind our high
                electricity prices are undoubtedly to do with the way in which
                the electricity industry was sold off. There are problems with
                the generators’ long-term contracts. Various ways have been
                suggested in which that can be addressed. Consumers here are
                already paying high rates, and this morning the Minister of
                Finance and Personnel offered no relief on that score as once
                again rates are to go up by double the rate of inflation. Next
                year electricity prices are going up by three times the rate of
                inflation. Those issues must be borne in mind.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Time and again reference has been made to the
                fact that people who receive social security benefits can obtain
                relief. There are many people who do not fall into that
                category: those who make just enough money to not fall into any
                qualification for benefit. They are always hit hardest when it
                comes to increases.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is right that we should be trying to
                increase the amount of money going into the programmes to deal
                with fuel poverty. However, there is concern across the House
                about going back to the customers and telling them that they
                should pay an extra 150%, — albeit phased in — in the energy
                efficiency levy, to cover the cost of putting more money into
                eradicating fuel poverty.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is there not a case for encouraging the
                regulator to talk to Northern Ireland Electricity (NIE)? It may
                not be possible to require NIE to pay this money. If that is the
                case, it is something that we should be looking at. It is
                incumbent on us, as public representatives, to say that a
                company with the profits that NIE is making — over £90
                million this year — should be asked to contribute towards this
                programme, in the light of the high prices that are already
                being charged to consumers and households in Northern Ireland.
                If it is not prepared to do that, then we should address the
                issues again.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To say that the onus will be put on the
                hard-pressed consumer to put up this amount of money is unfair.
                The revenue is not being raised from the appropriate section of
                the community. NIE has generated massive profits, and it has a
                responsibility to eradicate fuel poverty. That is not to say
                that the company has not done anything about this. It has worked
                with the Office for the Regulation of Electricity and Gas (OFREG)
                and others to try to improve the situation. However, to target
                consumers to raise this money is, as Mr Ford said, in effect
                putting another tax on consumers. It is unfair to go back to
                those consumers and ask them for the money to pay for these
                programmes. That takes the responsibility away from those who
                are better equipped to pay.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We could come to the House and say that it
                would be a good idea to increase pensions in Northern Ireland;
                that pensioners across the Province deserve more per person, per
                family, or per couple. Would it be acceptable for anyone in this
                House to stand up and agree, and levy an extra tax on pensioners
                to pay for it? That is effectively what we would be doing.
                &quot;Pay a bit more and you will see the benefits. It will go
                back into your pockets another way.&quot; That is unfair, and it
                is not the right approach.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should ask the regulator to go to NIE and
                see if there is a way in which this money can go into schemes to
                eradicate fuel poverty. We all agree with that, but not with
                taxing already hard-pressed households and families in Northern
                Ireland who are already paying the highest prices for
                electricity anywhere in Europe.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. I oppose the amendment
                on the grounds that Northern Ireland Electricity is unlikely to
                support any voluntary additional funding equivalent to the
                amount that would be generated by the proposed levy increase.
                NIE is a private company, and it would be unrealistic to expect
                it to set aside money towards the eradication of what is
                essentially a problem for Government.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wells and Mr Dodds have together tagged
                the levy increase and the additional voluntary funding by NIE.
                Therefore I cannot support the amendment. The proposed amendment
                sounds very good in theory, but it would be unrealistic in
                practice. It is better to get half a loaf as a consequence of
                the proposed motion than to have no bread, which would be the
                effect of the proposed amendment. The bottom line is that I
                support an increase in the levy, with no conditions attached.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fuel poverty is one of Northern Ireland’s
                hidden disgraces. Most people are probably unaware that the
                problem even exists. We take for granted the warmth of our
                homes, without recognising that many thousands of elderly folk
                and families with a low income have to spend the winter months
                wrapped up in layers of clothing, and suffering the physical
                effects of damp and cold. How often do we assume that poverty is
                something that we see on the streets and that it does not exist
                for people who have a roof over their heads? That is not the
                case.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Poverty, particularly fuel poverty, is an all
                too frequent reality for over 170,000 households in Northern
                Ireland. It is a reality that must be addressed. Low income
                levels and high energy costs combine with limited access to
                energy-efficient fuels to create a cyclic cocktail of fuel
                poverty for far too many people in the Province. Those factors
                contribute to the proportionately higher levels of fuel poverty
                that exist here, by comparison with the rest of the United
                Kingdom.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The situation is far from satisfactory. The
                current energy efficiency levy, which is £2 per customer,
                raises £1·4 million per annum and is used to develop energy
                efficiency and fuel poverty strategies. To date, £3·4 million
                has been used in that way. Of that, £2·2 million, or 65%, has
                been directly targeted at fuel-poor customers. That is all to be
                commended, but it does not go far enough to eradicate the
                ingrained poverty trap that is experienced by so many families.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The time has come to explore the possibility
                of an increase in the levy, and I am sure that most warm people
                would support a small rise in it. Any additional revenue raised
                as a result of the levy increase must be efficiently targeted at
                helping the fuel poor. An increase in the levy to £5 per
                customer would raise an estimated total of £3·4 million per
                annum. I contend that the vast bulk of that capital should be
                directed at energy efficiency and financial support programmes
                aimed at those in greatest need. The tangible benefits of
                increasing the levy from £2 to £5 per customer would
                demonstrate the Executive’s commitment to the eradication of
                fuel poverty as outlined in the Programme for Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the Executive are serious about the
                eradication of fuel poverty, they could go even further than
                merely stating their aim of intent. It would take approximately
                £50 million to eradicate fuel poverty in the Province. To
                increase the levy to £5 per customer would raise an additional
                £2 million towards this aim. It is worth remembering that at
                the proposed rate of return it will still take 25 years to stamp
                out fuel poverty in the Province.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive, however, could help to
                eradicate fuel poverty much faster, by signalling their support
                for the setting aside of moneys specifically to tackle the
                problem. Rather than seek support from NIE as outlined in the
                amendment, the Executive could signal to the community its
                appreciation of the extent of the problem and its willingness to
                take tangible financial steps towards relieving the difficulty
                faced by so many in the community.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with some of what Sammy Wilson said,

                towards eradicating fuel poverty. The onus should be on the
                Executive to help eradicate fuel poverty.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion, because additional
                funding, if created, will augment and complement statutory
                funding and have a significant impact on the battle against fuel
                poverty. The onus is on the Assembly, and the Executive in
                particular, to help break the cycle of fuel poverty that so many
                households in Northern Ireland experience. The situation will
                get worse unless Members act now to deliver hope to those senior
                citizens and families who face another winter in the war to keep

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I too support the motion. It is unacceptable
                that there are old people and poor people in this country
                sitting with their coats on during the winter because they
                cannot afford to light their fires. We are not living in the
                Dark Ages; this is the twenty-first century. The Assembly must
                look at how it can eradicate the problem of fuel poverty.
                Guidelines state that people who have to spend more than 10% of
                their income on necessary fuel for heating, lighting or
                appliances suffer from fuel poverty. That includes many people
                in Northern Ireland, bearing in mind its high levels of
                unemployment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with some of what Mr Dodds said in
                moving the amendment. People in this country are already
                strapped for cash, and they are paying the highest energy prices
                anywhere in Europe. That is a legacy that we inherited from Mrs
                Thatcher, and it must be addressed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McClarty said that the Executive needed to
                look at this issue. I see that the Minister for Social
                Development is in the Chamber, and I thank him for his presence.
                I know that he shares Members’ concerns about fuel poverty and
                that he has taken steps through the Domestic Energy Efficiency
                Scheme (DEES) to try and assist with the problem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unlike Scotland and Wales, Northern Ireland
                does not have any targets in place for reducing fuel poverty.
                The National Assembly for Wales is aiming to reduce fuel poverty
                in 15 years, and the Scottish Parliament is trying to do so
                within 10 years. The people of Northern Ireland need to know
                where they stand and what the Assembly is going to do for them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There will always be pressures on finance,
                especially in the Department for Social Development. However, I
                urge the Minister to make the case for Executive programme funds
                to target this worthwhile issue. Fuel poverty affects people
                throughout Northern Ireland, regardless of their religion or
                background. The problem seems to be worse in rural areas, where
                higher numbers of people appear to be suffering from fuel
                poverty.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have heard the argument that one can tell
                the old-age pensioners that they will pay £5 more, but one
                cannot negotiate with a company that has somewhere in the region
                of £96 million in the kitty at the end of the year. Surely the
                Assembly should have the power to reason with that company and
                point that out to it. If it slaps us in the face and says
                &quot;No&quot;, then the Assembly has legislative authority to
                go back to the company and do it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let nobody think that they can hide from this
                big issue. If a £5 energy efficiency levy is imposed on
                everyone, those who are just above the poverty line will have to
                pay it, and those below the poverty line will also have to pay
                it. Why put a levy on the people that need help?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr O’Connor:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There already is a levy. The precedent has
                been set; it is £2 at present. We are suggesting an increase of
                6p a week, which would not buy one a slice of pan loaf.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must consider how to deal with this
                matter. For every pound that is raised, approximately £10 is
                saved. If £2 million were raised to provide people with
                low-energy light bulbs, the savings to those people would be
                approximately £20 million. That would allow them greater
                flexibility to spend their money on food and on other essentials
                rather than being obliged to spend it on heating. People should
                not be forced to choose between heating and eating. An increase
                of 6p a week would give the most vulnerable a tenfold return as
                they could afford extra energy-efficient appliances, such as
                light bulbs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is only a drop in the ocean, and we are
                only tinkering at the edges. It must be mainstreamed. We spoke
                about targeting social need; who better to target than the most
                vulnerable? We must think of the savings to the Health Service.
                Mr McClarty said that there are 170,000 fuel-poor homes in
                Northern Ireland. How many people develop pneumonia, asthma,
                influenza and other stress-related illnesses because they live
                in cold, damp homes? Tackling fuel poverty could save the Health
                Service money, because fewer people would get sick.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I urge the Minister to reconsider a system
                that allows landlords to claim housing benefit for houses that
                are damp and unfit. Landlords should be obliged to repair houses
                before any housing benefit is paid. People can get a statutory
                notice from a district council served on a house that is damp or
                full of mould. They then approach the Department for Social
                Development with a begging bowl for a grant to subsidise what is
                in effect a business. People are entitled to a decent standard
                of living; no one should have to live in such conditions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must educate the most vulnerable in how to
                use their energy efficiently. Education is a great way forward.
                People have elaborate heating systems that they do not know how
                to use, so they are not getting maximum efficiency from them.
                Such programmes must be developed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yesterday Mr Empey said that he was committed
                to targeting social exclusion. The most vulnerable people in our
                society will benefit from what Mr Ford has proposed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept that it is a stealth tax, but an
                extra 6p a week can generate benefits for some of our neediest
                people, and I welcome it. It does not, however, detract from the
                Executive’s responsibility in this area.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.45 pm</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Everyone in the House will agree that this is
                a crisis, and we must approach the problem with a crisis
                attitude. Mr O’Connor spoke about sixpence, but to people
                living in poverty sixpence is a large sum of money. This £5 is
                added to the rate. Everyone paying for electricity in Northern
                Ireland is paying more than people do anywhere else in Europe.
                NIE is pulling in millions, yet it tells us to place the burden
                on the poor consumer. I do not accept that. People who have
                enough money would be quite happy to give £5 a year. However,
                there are people who do not have enough money, and I want to
                have those people eliminated from paying this charge. I was told
                that that would be impossible. The £5 taken from those poor
                people will be sore on them. If it is only sixpence per week, it
                would be peanuts to the people who bring in a profit of £96
                million.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are getting this the wrong way round. We
                cannot say to NIE that we want it to pay up, but as reasonable
                people we can state the problem in relation to this levy. We can
                say to NIE that with the gains it receives from its consumers it
                should do the honourable thing and tell us how much of a
                contribution it is going to make. That is a reasonable thing to
                do. If NIE says that it will give nothing, we will know the
                nature of the brute and who it is looking after — the people
                who have invested in its companies in order to receive higher
                dividends. NIE is not looking after the consumers. It would be
                immoral for NIE to take that attitude, and I do not think it
                will do so. As I understand it from the proposer of the motion,
                NIE has made some contribution to this situation. Why can we not
                ask NIE to make a greater contribution? Why should we not aim to
                have fuel poverty eliminated in five years’ time rather than
                10 years’ time? The only way we can do that is to exert
                pressure on the organisation that has the money. And it has that
                money because higher rates are being charged in Northern Ireland
                than anywhere else in Europe.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive and Sir Reg Empey cannot escape
                either; they should be putting their money where their mouth is.
                Sir Reg Empey said that he will target the needy, but instead
                the poorest people have to join this scheme and pay the tariff.
                It is a tax, and it is not morally defensible. The people of
                Northern Ireland would be outraged to think that instead of our
                going to NIE to ask for help, others want us to jump in and
                impose the levy immediately. I was told that if it were not done
                immediately, it would not be voted through. In conscience
                neither my Colleagues nor I could support this motion. We are
                not recommending that this scheme should stop. What we are
                saying is: go to the people who have the money and see what they
                can give us. If they do not give us the money, we will have to
                take other steps. Members have the power to do this. I was told
                that we would have to legislate. What is wrong with legislation?
                Are we not called here to legislate? That is not a problem. It
                will not take long to consult with NIE.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That can be carried out, we can look at the
                results, and we can then return to the outlook that NIE is
                prepared to make money from the people of Northern Ireland —
                both the poor and the rich — but that it is unprepared to help
                when there is a problem. I would like the problem to be solved
                in one year rather than in 10. However, we could at least halve
                the proposed time to five years; that would be a better
                proposition.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.
                I support the motion. Although I agree with the spirit of the
                amendment and the reasoning behind it — it is clear that NIE
                has made massive profits from consumers in the North of Ireland
                — the practical outcome of the amendment will be to hinder the
                creation of a levy and the proper eradication of fuel poverty.
                For that reason only, I cannot support the amendment. However, I
                hope that a similar motion will be tabled in the future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People in the Chamber will recognise that my
                Colleagues in the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment
                are in the middle of an inquiry into energy and, in particular,
                into the higher price of electricity in the North of Ireland. An
                issue that arises frequently is the generation contracts that
                were negotiated at the time of privatisation in 1992 and 1993.
                Those contracts are largely responsible for the high electricity
                prices in the North of Ireland; they are the highest in Europe.
                The people who benefit most from high prices are the
                shareholders of NIE, most of whom do not even live in the North
                of Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the time of privatisation, the British
                Treasury received twice the price per megawatt of generation
                capacity from the North of Ireland as it did from Britain. The
                power stations were sold for £352 million. The contracts are
                not competitive. Companies are paid an availability payment in
                addition to the full cost of the fuel that they use to generate
                electricity. The cost of generation is 60% of the final cost of
                electricity. That cost is passed on to the consumers in their
                fuel bills.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The costs of refurbishment programmes at
                power stations are also often passed on to the consumers.
                Ballylumford was sold to British Gas and operated by its
                subsidiary, Premier Power Ltd, on the condition that a pipeline
                from Scotland to the Six Counties be created and that the
                station be converted to gas with EU grant aid. The Ballylumford
                contract has been renegotiated, but the result of that is that
                the customers will have to pay for the new deal until the year
                2012. AES Corporation, an American multinational company, owns
                Kilroot and Belfast West power stations. In 2000, AES made a net
                income worldwide of US$658 million.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is clear to those examining the issue and
                to members of the Enterprise, Trade and Investment Committee
                that the generation contracts will inhibit the introduction of
                full competition. There is a real risk that low-income
                consumers, who are unattractive to new companies entering the
                market, will be left to pay an increased share of the generation
                costs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although I support the motion, it represents
                only one part of the equation in tackling fuel poverty. In
                addition, the electricity regulator should be given full powers
                to regulate the generation companies, including ensuring full
                competition and the end of unfair contracts. Until those unfair
                contracts are renegotiated or done away with, we will not be
                able to tackle fuel poverty seriously.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the increased levy would be a first
                step and would go some way toward alleviating fuel poverty.
                While it proposes an increase of £5 per customer per year,
                which would raise a total of £3·4 million per annum, it is
                also expected to save customers £22·5 million per annum. That
                would be money well spent and would, in the long term, benefit
                electricity consumers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the motion is passed — and I sincerely
                hope that it will be — the system needs to operate in a fully
                transparent, open and accountable manner. We must ensure that
                every single penny of that £5 customer levy goes toward
                eradicating fuel poverty. Go raibh maith agat.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I find myself falling between two stools in
                this debate. Standing between the DUP and the Alliance Party is
                not a very comfortable place to be — I am between a rock and a
                hard place. I have listened with a great deal of interest. I
                have had both the motion and the amendment in my head, and I
                wanted to hear the arguments on both sides and to be convinced
                of the right way. That is what is so valuable about debating in
                the Chamber. While I agree that there should be an increase in
                the levy, I do not agree that those in fuel poverty should have
                to pay an additional increase.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was impressed by Mr Dodds’s and Dr
                Paisley’s arguments that the issue should be brought into the
                context of Northern Ireland. It is very difficult to ask
                consumers — industrial as well as private consumers — to pay
                more for their electricity. The rise may be only 6p per week,
                but that is 6p per week on top of the highest electricity prices
                in Europe, if not the world. It is a mountain that is perhaps
                too high to climb.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This must be looked at much more
                imaginatively. It has been argued that nobody can force Northern
                Ireland Electricity (NIE) to act, as it is a privatised company,
                but we must look at how it has been done elsewhere. I
                understand, although I have no details on it, that a windfall
                tax on privatised utilities is in operation in England. When
                profits rise above a fixed level — <i>[Interruption]</i>. You
                say that it is as high as £96 million. Companies are taxed on
                that amount, and the tax then goes into the fuel poverty
                programmes. That would, of course, need new legislation, a stage
                that we have not yet reached. However, surely the Assembly could
                do something more imaginative to help those in fuel poverty
                without taxing them further.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was said that 170,000 households were
                affected by fuel poverty, including pensioners and those on low
                incomes. Statistics have already been quoted about people who
                have died from the cold as a result of having to choose between
                heating and eating.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The point was made that people who endure
                fuel poverty are more likely to use coal than electricity for
                heating. Is that not the case? They pay an increased levy on
                electricity bills, but the price of coal, which they use to heat
                their homes, stays the same.</p>

                Dr O’Hagan raised the issue of the increase. The Committee for
                Enterprise, Trade and Investment has listened to the regulator,
                Douglas McIldoon, and his call for an increase in this levy. The
                Committee supports that, but it has major reservations. He said,
                for example, that it is proposed to ring-fence the increase at
                80% for the fuel poor. That is not enough. If that is to happen
                it must be 100%. Guarantees must be given that not only 100%
                goes back to the fuel poor, but that somehow every single one of
                those 170,000 fuel-poor households benefits. At the moment I am
                not certain of that guarantee.</p>

                that levy was very low when it came in, but it is now going up
                and up? How much will it rise? Will we have another rise next
                year? It is going up rapidly. It started at £1, and now it is
                going up to £5.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is a concern. It puts an added burden on
                the consumer. I underscore the point that 6p per week — an
                increase of £3 per year — may be very little for those in the
                House to contemplate, but if we suffered as the fuel poor
                suffer, especially in winter, such an added burden would
                possibly be too much to bear.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members, we have completed the first round of
                speakers from each political party, and because of the numbers
                who wish to speak I must, unfortunately, ask you to limit your

                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Cobain:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not going to get into arguments about
                NIE. The moral responsibility to tackle fuel poverty lies in the
                Chamber, not elsewhere. Everyone knows, and the points have been
                made, that we are dealing with the most deprived people in
                society. The Minister of Finance and Personnel said this morning
                that most of his Budgets are directed towards those who live in
                need. The fuel poor are such people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Six hundred people die each year of
                cold-related illnesses. It is a moral responsibility for the
                House and the Executive to cure that problem. We may get
                assistance from NIE, which is fine, but the moral responsibility
                lies with the Assembly and with the Executive. Between £40
                million and £50 million is needed to eradicate the situation.
                Those are capital programmes, not revenue programmes, and once
                spent they do not need to be spent again. That cannot be done
                overnight; it will take five or six years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister has introduced the domestic
                energy efficiency scheme, which has been very important.
                However, the number of people who can apply for that is limited,
                as he is restricted by the amount of money the Executive have
                given him.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we really want to eradicate fuel poverty
                we need to do it through an Executive programme. There are no
                short cuts. NIE might get £1 million or £2 million per year.
                That would make some difference, but not much. If the House is
                really intent on removing fuel poverty, it can be achieved in
                the Budget. We can insist that, in the next six or seven years,
                the Executive programme funds provide an additional £4 million
                or £5 million per year for the Minister, and in five or six
                years from now fuel poverty will be eradicated. It is as simple
                as that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Every Member has said how moved he or she is
                by people who endure fuel poverty before going on to appeal to a
                private company to eradicate it. However, responsibility does
                not lie with the private sector or the public one. The House
                should decide, and make it known, that Members will no longer
                tolerate people having to endure fuel poverty. We should
                instruct the person responsible to bring forward a scheme to
                allow the Minister for Social Development to have the necessary
                money to eradicate it. It will not be eradicated next year or
                the year after that; it will take five or six years because of
                the number of people involved. That should be the end of the
                argument.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am glad that the fuel poverty issue has
                been brought to the House. What must strike us is that we are
                divided only on how to eradicate it. Members agree that
                something must be done. It is conceivable that had the mover of
                the amendment joined with the mover of the substantive motion,
                both subjects could have been debated simultaneously. That would
                have been in the best interests of all the people whom we want
                to help.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The SDLP waxed and waned about the best
                approach to adopt. As our social development spokesperson said,
                we came down in support of the motion. That was partly because
                of the structure of the efficiency levy. We realised that
                overriding the levy as a way to raise funds to combat fuel
                poverty might damage the mechanism. We must be conscious of
                that. If we ignore or avoid that mechanism, we could damage its
                future use.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ian Paisley referred to a second concern of
                the SDLP. He wondered why we do not ask NIE for more money. The
                motion asks the regulator to move on that. It is his job to
                approach NIE to ask for more money and for a reasonable level of
                increases in people’s bills. He has been doing that with some
                success for a while. We should encourage him.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The SDLP feels that it should support the
                substantive motion because it will provide us with a means to
                solve the fuel poverty problem. Some people said that the levy
                is rising — the phrase used was &quot;going up and up&quot;.
                That is inaccurate; there have been only two increases. However,
                if the levy is increasing, it is because it needs to address the
                increasing problem of fuel poverty. That problem is not
                disappearing, so we must address it. The levy is increasing to
                help those people in the most need. One cannot have it both
                ways. People cannot be asked to contribute in order to cure the
                problem. The problem must be tackled, and money must be spent on
                it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important for us to be sure that any
                extra funds that are raised go directly to those who need them.
                The SDLP is concerned about whether the real fuel poor have been
                identified.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Particular attention is, by necessity, paid
                to pensioners, who are at risk because of health problems and a
                lack of funds. However, why is no provision made for disabled
                people, who are often housebound and reliant on benefits? What
                about single parents, large families and, in some cases,
                students? A broadly accepted definition of fuel poverty is the
                need to spend 10% of one’s disposable income on fuel costs.
                Many people, however, must choose between paying for food and
                heat. People often choose heat. That is why there are vulnerable
                people who get sick, and that is the reason for the figures that
                we have heard today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those with greater heating needs — those
                who spend more time at home — are most at risk. Ironically,
                those who are claiming benefits, are disabled or are in receipt
                of pensions are the people who receive bigger bills. Those
                people have the lowest disposable incomes. That creates the fuel
                poverty trap, which we must address.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr M Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to begin by saying that I
                welcome the fact that the widespread problem of fuel poverty is
                being addressed, but I have great difficulty with the charge,
                which will once again fall on the purse of the customer. The
                levy currently stands at £2 per customer, with National Energy
                Action (NEA) now advocating an increase of 150%, which would
                raise the levy to £5 per customer, in the hope that
                £3·4million can be raised for energy efficiency and the
                eventual eradication of fuel poverty.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My difficulty stems from the fact that, once
                again, the extra charge will fall on the customer. Why should
                the customer pay for the scheme, when NIE’s profits for the
                year 1999-2000 were £96·1 million? What is the problem with
                diverting £3·4 million from this profit margin to eradicate
                fuel poverty? Would it make a great difference to reduce the
                profit margin to £92·7 million from £96·1 million? It
                appears that the profits are bypassing the customer and being
                directed, once again, into the pockets of the so-called fat
                cats.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main difficulty is that the market for
                gas and electricity in Northern Ireland is relatively small,
                which means that NIE does not have any direct competition. That
                has led to high charges. I must point out that Northern Ireland
                has higher levels of fuel poverty than mainland Britain. NIE
                continues to pass any extra costs on to the customer, which
                contradicts its aim to reduce fuel prices in Northern Ireland.
                NIE has supposedly been working hard over the past four years to
                reduce electricity prices in Northern Ireland, yet here we stand
                in 2001, debating an increase in the customer levy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The most vulnerable in our society are the
                people who would be classified as the fuel poor. Those who fall
                into this category are lone parents, the unemployed, Housing
                Executive tenants, low-income families and the elderly. It is
                hard to believe that there are over 170,000 households that
                suffer from fuel poverty in Northern Ireland. That is why I feel
                that it is of extreme importance to be absolutely sure that the
                cost does not fall on every NIE customer, regardless of status.
                The system must not only be fair and inclusive, but must also be
                seen to be fair and inclusive, with the most needy as the
                beneficiaries. It is, therefore, important that those who would
                be classified as the fuel poor will incur no extra cost.
                Therefore, I state that I would fully support any scheme that
                aims to tackle fuel poverty, as long as those who are considered
                to be the fuel poor do not pay the highest price.</p>

                the motion. It prescribes a measure that can contribute to the
                eradication of fuel poverty. Many Members have said that fuel
                poverty effects approximately 170,000 households in the Six
                Counties. It is a particular problem in rural areas, where there
                are high levels of unfit housing, properties are widespread and
                isolated, and dwellings tend to be larger and mostly in the
                private- rented or owner-occupied sectors.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the proposal to create an extra
                £3·6 million, and it should be created as a matter of urgency.
                Many Members have reminded the Executive of their responsibility
                — and that responsibility is additional to, not in place of,
                the Executive’s normal responsibilities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A partial solution has been suggested, which
                we should embrace. It requires political support and will. I
                agree that the additional revenue generated must be directed
                towards the fuel poor. Ultimately, it is a matter of people’s
                health and of improving the quality of their lives — not least
                those who are most vulnerable, needy and disadvantaged. It is a
                matter of saving people from ill health, misery, cold and, in
                many cases, death.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will not speak for much longer. As Mr
                ONeill said, the debate has been constructive. I welcome the
                unusual engagement of the DUP — its contribution has also been
                constructive.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the opportunity to engage in this
                debate on energy, as the issue has been a bee in my bonnet for
                some time. There is so much more to the issue, and we are
                dipping — in an almost one-dimensional fashion — into a
                massive issue for the entire community; so much so that it cuts
                across all Departments, although the main responsibility lies
                with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the core of the motion are some serious
                facts that we often ignore. Brief mention has been made of the
                fact that electricity prices are much too high and that those
                prices are being driven by a rip-off. As somebody once said,
                Dick Turpin wore a mask. The rip-off of 1992 was much more
                effective than anything that Dick Turpin ever did. The price of
                electricity in Northern Ireland was effectively doubled.
                Contracts were put in place that allowed the price of
                electricity to be doubled for 20 years so that the Chancellor of
                the Exchequer could double what he charged those who were buying
                out the generating stations. That ensured a good return for the
                Chancellor and solid, guaranteed profits for the power station
                owners and shareholders.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ultimately, it sold all electricity users in
                Northern Ireland — from the very poor to the very wealthy —
                into a 20-year bondage that is extremely difficult to escape
                from. However, we must escape from it, and there is an onus on
                the Assembly, the Executive, the Departments and the Government
                to do everything in their power to break the cartel and free us
                from bondage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Everything in relation to energy in Northern
                Ireland flows from those contracts. The prices of other energy
                sources are pulled up or down — and in this case pulled up
                high — by those contracts. Due to the history of the Northern
                Ireland Electricity Board — subsequently NIE and now Viridian
                — our energy market is, by and large, supply-driven, and
                little or no consideration is given to the consumers. By
                consumers, I mean everyone from the big industrial user down to
                the householders who cannot afford to heat their homes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is absolutely no motivation within that
                plethora of energy policy to cut energy use, to improve
                conservation efforts, or to develop any renewable or alternative
                sources. The main thrust of our energy policy is to ensure that
                the generators get rid of as much electricity as possible and
                charge as much as possible for it. NIE then comes in,
                distributes the electricity and works that system. The more
                electricity NIE can pump through its system, the more money it
                gets. Therefore, there is an aversion to conservation, saving
                energy, and discovering alternative sources of energy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The cost of electricity generation has fallen
                considerably over the past 10 years because of greater
                efficiencies in generation costs. However, the benefits all go
                towards the bottom line — the profits of the company or
                companies involved. I received a letter today from an industrial
                user who complained that the price of electricity has gone up by
                31% in the past 14 months. The prices compared very unfavourably
                to those in England and Scotland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another serious consideration for me, which I
                do not believe has been touched on already, is that householders
                cannot afford to keep their homes warm, and we have every right
                to emphasise that fact. The big industrial users often have
                enough muscle and clout to ensure special deals — and I do not
                blame them for using that clout. As the market starts to become
                deregulated they will have the option to work for a cheaper
                price within their contracts. However, the net effect will be
                that the poor, the dispossessed and those who cannot afford to
                heat their homes will make up for that subsidy. If the large
                electricity users get a price cut, the price for the small users
                will rise by 5% or by 10%.</p>

                people. I could run through many more issues but I will leave it
                there. We need to take the issue seriously. We have made a start
                on it today.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the amendment. The DUP takes the
                matter very seriously; that is why we proposed the amendment.
                Many constituents have spoken to me about the issue, and they
                have expressed concern that the energy efficiency levy has been
                raised to £5. Although there may not be much difference in the
                opinions of people in the Chamber as regards the motion and the
                amendment, it really comes down to who should pay for the
                increased levy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The people who will suffer will be those who
                pay the tax increase. I call it that because many of us feel
                that it is a tax disguised as a levy. Senior citizens can least
                afford to pay it, and they have come to our advice centres to
                tell us that. They have stated that they are unhappy with the
                levy, not because it is a big charge in itself, but because,
                over the year, it cumulatively takes away their income. Our
                responsibility as elected representatives is to ensure that
                senior citizens and those who fall into the category of enduring
                fuel poverty can pay. It is unfair that they should be asked to
                pay that levy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Everyone agrees that to try to eradicate fuel
                poverty is a worthwhile goal, and that is what we are aiming
                for. All of the parties are committed to it. We want to see fuel
                poverty being eradicated. Our amendment provides a method to try
                to address the levy charge. It is unfair that those who can
                least afford to pay the levy should shoulder a portion of costs,
                and that is why we have put forward the amendment. We have the
                highest electricity charges in the UK — indeed, in Europe. To
                insist that the consumers, our constituents, should have to pay
                that levy is unfair; many would say that it is immoral.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NIE’s profits are already over £90 million
                and rising. Do Members not agree that a portion of NIE profits
                could, and should, be used to reduce the energy efficiency levy?
                Last week, when I spoke to NIE officials about the matter, they
                insisted that, although their proposed increase is £5, they
                could not guarantee that the charge would not end up being equal
                to the current charge on the mainland, which is £7·50.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is that the thin edge of the wedge? Will the
                increase be £7·50 next year? Where will the charges end?
                Should not the party that can afford to cover the increase in
                costs take responsibility for it? The increase, which started at
                £1 and could end up at £7·50, is just the latest chapter. We
                are all committed to the eradication of fuel poverty and to
                helping those who need it most.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Housing Executive has already introduced
                a policy to help its tenants, and that programme is well
                advanced. Mr Cobain suggested that the Assembly and the
                Executive make a contribution. That contribution, combined with
                the existing levy charge and a voluntary contribution from NIE,
                would yield sufficient money to address the issue. It is only
                fair that NIE should contribute some of its large profit to
                eradicate fuel poverty.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NIE has received exorbitant profits, which
                have been paid for by the consumer, including those in the grip
                of fuel poverty. The levy to address fuel poverty, as proposed
                in the motion, will apply only to those who can least afford to
                pay it. The amended motion would provide a means to address the
                issue to everyone’s satisfaction. We all feel that something
                must be done. Let the financial responsibility fall on the
                shoulders of those who can afford it. Those who can least afford
                to pay should not be charged. The DUP amendment would protect
                those who cannot afford to pay the levy. I support the
                amendment.</p>

                I support the increase in the levy and the benefits that it
                could achieve. However, there needs to be greater transparency
                in the administration of the levy; we should be able to see how
                the proceeds from it are spent. The funds that are raised should
                be used to lift people out of fuel poverty rather than deliver
                piecemeal measures that merely reduce the problem slightly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In tandem with the Programme for Government,
                our first and foremost task is to end poverty, especially fuel
                poverty. We must ensure that the cold, misery and ill health
                experienced in many households during the long, cold winter
                months are ended for good.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NEA is a charity that campaigns for solutions
                to fuel poverty, including heating and insulation problems that
                are suffered by people on low incomes. With the support of the
                Energy Saving Trust, the NEA seeks support from elected
                representatives to help bring about an increase in energy levels
                and to create more funds to tackle fuel poverty.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over 170,000 households in Northern Ireland
                suffer from fuel poverty. Lower income levels, combined with a
                lack of access to energy efficient fuel and the high cost of
                energy, contribute to higher levels of fuel poverty than in
                Britain. Fuel poverty damages houses, causing dampness,
                condensation, mould growth, disrepair and unfit conditions. Fuel
                poverty exists in parts of Belfast, but, for the large part,
                rural areas experience it. It also damages health, causing
                asthma, heart disease, pneumonia, influenza and stress, and it
                leads to more than 700 deaths every year.</p>

                release harmful emissions that damage the environment. To
                increase the levy to £5 will provide an annual carbon saving of
                81,000 tonnes and energy savings of 32 gigawatt hours, which in
                turn will improve the environment. I support the motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Courtney:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I too support the motion. Fuel poverty could
                be defined as the inability to afford sufficient heating for a
                home. The reasons for that vary, but ultimately those who cannot
                afford sufficient heating are not helped by information
                campaigns. They simply cannot afford the cost. An income-based
                analysis can also mislead, because people who work and with
                limited income may be forced to continue to pay for fuel at the
                expense of other necessities, such as food and clothing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fuel poverty trap contains those who
                spend more than 10% of their disposable income on fuel costs.
                Because domestic electricity prices offer little or no
                elasticity, it logically follows that the less income a person
                has, the more he will spend proportionally on fuel. The most
                recent changes, such as the abolition of standing charges, offer
                nothing to those who have little or no choice in their fuel
                consumption, while central subsidy to NIE has benefited
                industrial users. In addition, those social groups that are most
                at risk of fuel poverty are those who spend more time in the
                home — those with higher needs such as people with young
                families, pensioners and the disabled.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also have property-based analyses, which
                can help to determine the causes of inefficient fuel use. There
                are sets of funding available for energy efficient measures,
                such as insulation, but that falls far short of what is really
                needed if we are going to approach the problem seriously.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regional climate variations are not currently
                considered when fuel needs are being addressed. The seven-day
                rule which triggers retrospective payments to select recipients
                of income support is viewed by many as a deliberate attempt to
                reduce such payments. It is reasonable to expect that people at
                this stage in Northern Ireland’s socio-economic development
                should not have to deny themselves sufficient heat. It has been
                stated already that there are 600 deaths a year due to
                hypothermia, and many people’s medical problems are
                exacerbated by a lack of heating in their homes. It has also
                been said that more than 170,000 households endure fuel poverty
                in Northern Ireland. Lower income levels combined with a lack of
                access to energy-efficient fuels and high energy costs
                contribute proportionally to higher levels of fuel poverty than
                in Britain.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Northern Ireland Executive have committed
                themselves to the eradication of fuel poverty. This morning the
                Minister of Finance and Personnel said in his draft Budget
                statement that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;specific actions will be taken to
                reduce fuel poverty&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The energy efficiency levy is currently £2
                per consumer. That raises £1·4 million per year. The amendment
                suggests that we approach NIE and ask it to make funding
                available. My party, in most instances, would say that that is
                the right way to advance. In this instance, we accept that NIE
                has not shown much commitment over the years. It did have an
                energy needs programme a few years ago, and, at that stage, it
                did improve energy for pig farmers, community buildings and some
                pensioners. That was a good first step, but it was not built on.
                If it had been, we would not be here considering increasing the
                levy from £2 to £5 per customer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposed increase would raise a total of
                £3·6 million per year and earn £2 million each year to help
                with energy efficiency and fuel poverty. It is proposed to
                direct that increase to the fuel poor — that is 80% — to
                help to meet Government commitments in the Programme for
                Government and the UK fuel poverty strategy. Mick Murphy quoted
                from the NEA. The Energy Saving Trust also supports the
                increased levy, and because of that we support it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NEA in Northern Ireland has said that it
                supports the increase of the levy on the basis that it would
                create</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;a source of significant additional
                funding to complement statutory funding for fuel poverty
                programmes. The levy can play a significant role in the
                eradication of fuel poverty, ensuring that the cold, misery and
                ill health experienced by so many vulnerable households during
                colder months is ended for good.&quot;</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr William McCrea:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Mr Ford for raising the subject in
                the House, and I accept his sincerity in doing so. None the
                less, I support the amendment, which proposes a better way
                forward, although I think that there is a better way forward
                still.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a fuel poverty crisis, and many
                people are in tremendous need, which no one denies. We must
                resolve the crisis urgently, which no one denies either. Moral
                responsibility does not lie with the ordinary consumer.
                Unfortunately, the change proposed in the motion would place a
                moral responsibility on the ordinary consumer, who already faces
                exorbitant electricity costs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some Members may not have been in the Chamber
                this morning when the Minister of Finance and Personnel spoke.
                This is the second tax increase to be discussed today. In the
                Minister’s presentation of the draft Budget, he said that £2
                million had been withdrawn from councils. To make up that £2
                million, people will have to pay higher rates. That was slipped
                in before Members realised that it was being done.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Higher taxes have already been levied in the
                draft Budget. The extra money that we are discussing now is on
                top of the other rise that we heard about earlier, which will
                affect 16 of the weakest councils. Several Members sit on those
                councils, and they will soon get a wake-up call. It is not just
                a matter of a few pence a week; the tax comes on top of the
                other tax that has already been slipped in.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moral responsibility does not rest with the
                ordinary consumer, nor is it necessarily the responsibility of
                NIE, although NIE is in a better position to pay and has the
                necessary profits to do so. Where does the responsibility lie?
                It lies with the Assembly, not with the others on whom we are
                trying to put it. We say piously that we are trying to act in
                everyone’s best interests, but the best solution could be a
                tripartite one, involving customers, NIE — if it wants to
                prove its good faith in the matter — and the Assembly. The
                Assembly should put its money where its mouth is. If we achieve
                genuine unanimity on the matter, we can table an amendment to
                the draft Budget.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It will be interesting to see how sincere
                everyone is on this important issue. Do we impose a further tax
                on the ordinary consumer, many of whom are caught in the poverty
                trap?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a poverty trap. Those who are above
                the level of income regarded as the poverty line have to pay for
                everything. Those are the people who will be paying again. I
                suggest to the Assembly that a wake-up call is needed to the
                fact that we have already heard recommendations for a tax to be
                slipped in. Here now is a second tax. That is not the way
                forward. Let us have good faith from everyone. Let us have a
                tripartite approach, so that we can see it done in five years’
                time rather than in 10.</p>

                been a useful and constructive debate. All the contributions
                have dealt with the subject in a relevant way. As Dr McCrea has
                mentioned, we all agree on the objectives. There is no

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister for Social Development has sat
                through most, if not all, of the debate, and he will have taken
                that on board. He has programmes in place, which include a new
                domestic energy efficiency scheme, to try to push forward the
                eradication of fuel poverty in Northern Ireland. We all agree
                that the more money that can be put into that scheme the better.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice summed up the problem when she
                highlighted that we are asking the fuel poor to pay for the
                increase. Some people have talked about a figure of 6p per week.
                I have looked through a press release from NIE from last January
                on the subject of the 9% increase in electricity prices. A
                favourite trick, when you want to disguise the magnitude of an
                increase, is to bring it down to what is described as &quot;the
                cost of a newspaper&quot;. NIE put the price rise for a typical
                customer at about 60p per week, saying that all the customer was
                being asked to pay was the price of a newspaper per day.
                However, that amounts to £182·50 a year. When you put
                everything together, all those pence per day add up to a
                substantial amount of money.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr McCrea has already referred to today’s
                announcement of a 7% increase in the rates, and now we are back
                looking for more from Northern Ireland’s consumers,
                householders and families. Dr Paisley mentioned that that levy
                has increased substantially. Only two years ago the levy stood
                at £1. It was then proposed in 1999 that it should rise to
                £1·50 and then to £2 in the 2000-01 financial year. We are
                now being told that it should increase this year by another 150%
                .</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us get this into perspective. The levy
                has increased in two to three years by 500%. Where will it end?
                It is a handy little device to extract money to pay for things.
                We will deal with the issue that was rightly highlighted in the
                previous speech, and by Mr Cobain, about where the real
                responsibility lies. It is a useful device to extract money to
                pay for schemes that are rightly the Executive’s
                responsibility.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have already seen how this has been
                massively exploited. Nobody disagrees with the objectives to
                which the money is put; on this occasion it is the method by
                which the money is being raised, to which we object.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A point was raised about the money being
                spent on fuel poverty programmes. In an NIE press release dated
                25 September, rushed out today, we are told that 80% of the
                money raised through the levy is spent on fuel poverty
                programmes and that the remaining 20% is spent on schemes for
                business and pump-priming new energy efficiency initiatives.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It may have been Ms Morrice who asked why it
                should not all go towards fuel poverty programmes. We now find
                that 20% is being spent on schemes for business.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Not all businesses are making rich pickings,
                but a few are making a profit. However, the Assembly is told
                that 20% of the money that has been raised through the energy
                efficiency levy is going to business schemes. That must be
                addressed.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am amazed at some of the contributions from
                Members who claim to be of a social democratic disposition —
                and I do not mean the SDLP. I am talking about Members who
                generally take a left-of-centre or socialist viewpoint —
                Members who would usually be the first on their feet to decry
                anything that went against the socialist principles.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members are not only concerned with the
                objectives of the expenditure, they are concerned about how
                money is raised. The energy efficiency levy is a flat-rate tax
                on everybody. It is not progressive taxation; it is regressive
                taxation. The great argument against the poll tax, for instance,
                was that it would bear harvest from those least able to pay it.
                That is what Members are being asked to approve. The energy
                efficiency levy applies to the richest and the poorest people in
                Northern Ireland. They pay the same. How can anyone who claims
                to have socialist or social democratic principles agree with
                that? How can they go into the Lobby to vote for that?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr William McCrea:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We will soon see.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will see whether or not they are
                prepared to do that. For reasons of fairness and social equality
                the payment of the levy should be based on a consumer’s means.
                However, Members are asking the fuel poor to contribute the same
                as the best-off in Northern Ireland, which is wrong.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly should ask NIE what it can do to
                help eradicate fuel poverty. One Member from the SDLP said that
                there was no point in asking NIE for assistance because it had
                not done much for consumers. That is an argument for going back
                to NIE and trying again. The Assembly should put pressure on NIE;
                it should not give up and say &quot;They’ll not do anything,
                so let’s put the burden on the hard-pressed consumers and
                charge them all, no matter whether they can pay or not.&quot;</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, as was previously stated,
                responsibility for this matter lies with the Executive. When we
                discuss the Budget, Members will be able to table amendments to
                it. Then we will see whether Members are prepared to look at
                ways to amend the Budget to deal with the necessary expenditure.
                In advance of that, however, the House is faced with a proposal
                to levy the consumers — the customers, the families of
                Northern Ireland — at the same rate regardless of their
                ability to pay. The House should resist that proposal.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I mentioned the increase in the pension. Is
                someone seriously suggesting that one way to prevent the
                shortfall in housing budgets, which was raised this morning, is
                to levy the tenants an extra 10p per week to pay for more
                efficient maintenance programmes from which all tenants would
                benefit? Would any Member stand in the Chamber and seriously
                suggest that that is the proper approach to take?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proper approach is to put it up to the
                Executive. That is right, and when we come to the Budget, that
                is something that Members will address. Should the burden be
                placed on consumers, or should NIE be asked to fulfil its
                responsibilities and be pressurised into making a contribution?
                That is the question before the House, and if we fail, it will
                be dealt with in the Budget. We may well fail.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We know that we cannot force NIE to make a
                contribution: it is a private company. However, it is doing
                pretty well because of, as a number of Members have stated, the
                way in which it got its hands on the industry. Effectively, the
                Northern Ireland taxpayers were robbed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have had a good debate that has dealt with
                the issues. It is unfair and morally wrong to impose a flat-rate
                tax on the people who are least able to pay. Let us hesitate
                before we do that, and let us approach NIE. We will, of course,
                address the issue when we come to the Budget.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank everyone who contributed to the
                debate. It is a novel experience to wind up a debate in which
                there was to be significant disagreement about an amendment
                substance. The content of almost every speech has been the same,
                and there has been a unanimous feeling of concern for those
                people who are least well off in society. Many suggestions have
                been made as to how to provide the best method of support for
                them. The problem is that we disagree as to what the best method
                is. Mr ONeill was first to say that we clearly agree on the ends
                but disagree on the means.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A huge range of opinions have been voiced
                about how we should deal with the issue. We started off with a
                blunt statement from Mr McClarty, who was the first to ask
                whether NIE would be prepared to pay. That is the crux of the
                matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We had a number of contributions from members
                of the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment. Dr O’Hagan,
                Dr McDonnell and Ms Morrice raised issues regarding the ongoing
                inquiry and the total solution to the problems in that area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr O’Hagan said the motion was one part of
                the equation; I do not suggest that it forms the entire
                equation. The motion, as it stands, is a large part of what we
                want.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In an interesting exchange with Dr Paisley,
                Mr O’Connor highlighted the fact that for every £1 the
                pensioner pays £10 is returned in benefits. He is wrong. The
                tax is levied at a flat rate. However, the benefits are paid
                disproportionately — they go to those who are most in need.
                The tax is not regressive in the way that the poll tax was. With
                the poll tax, everyone paid the same flat rate, and there were
                variable benefits. On this occasion the benefits are clearly
                targeted at those most in need. Therefore, the overall package
                of benefits is in the ratio of 9:1 or 10:1, but the ratio, as
                regards benefits for those who are most in need, is
                significantly better. That is why much of what has been said in
                support of the amendment falls down. The benefits are paid
                disproportionately.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill and Mick Murphy asked whether we
                were really identifying the fuel poor. In my opening statement I
                said that we need to work to improve the scheme and ensure that
                there is proper openness and accountability. There is
                willingness on behalf of those who work under the existing levy
                to ensure that is the case.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we come to consider the amendment it
                seems to me that we are faced with a variety of questions that
                centre on a number of themes. Dr Paisley asked what is wrong
                with legislation. Mark Robinson asked where the problem lay in
                directing money from NIE to the scheme. The answer is that that
                depends on legislation, and, as we know, that that takes time.
                We have not established a record for speedy legislation in the
                House. I understand that we shall only have one day of business
                next week. There does not seem to be much business coming from
                the Executive. Perhaps we will see some improvement in coming
                weeks, and more business will come forward.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we wait for primary legislation to solve
                the problem, we need to look at what we shall do during the two,
                three or four years before Ministers get round to producing such
                legislation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree entirely with Dr McCrea on one point:
                that the best solution would be tripartite. We should look at
                making use of the existing levy, as well as a contribution from
                NIE and action by the Executive and by Ministers in relation to
                how the Budget is put to the House and voted on. What is the
                balance, and what can be done quickly?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds started off by saying that I had
                presented the case against my motion very fairly and knocked
                down most of the substantive points. I return the compliment by
                saying that both of us have understood the other’s position
                but have not agreed as to where we will reach that point. We all
                know what the social objectives are; they have been emphasised.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those who support the amendment talk about
                the costs and compare the levy to the increased charges paid by
                customers to NIE, which, those Members say, inflate its coffers.
                The levy is not going to the coffers of NIE. Mr Shannon was
                wrong when he said that the increase was an NIE increase. It is
                not; it is the increase of Douglas McIldoon, the regulator.
                Although it is collected by NIE, it is not NIE’s
                responsibility. We should give NIE neither the credit nor the
                blame.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The levy in Great Britain will shortly rise
                to £3·60 and then to £4·80 — the £7·50 figure is not in
                the offing, either in Great Britain or in Northern Ireland at
                the present time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have outlined the benefits, which will work
                out at nine or 10 times the expenditure. What money raised by
                general taxation as a result of the action of the Assembly ever
                produces a nine- or 10-times benefit, or even more than that,
                for those most in need?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have other options, such as Ms Morrice’s
                suggestion of a windfall tax or some form of levy on, or
                voluntary contribution from, NIE. On the day that the Minister
                of Enterprise, Trade and Industry presents a Bill to impose that
                levy I shall be happy to read it, but there is no sign of that,
                and it is not contained in the Programme for Government. We
                should accept that that will not arrive in the timescale that we
                need this year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We shall see what further amendments may be
                made to Executive funding by the Minister of Finance and
                Personnel. I am not holding my breath to see a significant and
                major change to the Budget. That is why we need to work on the
                basis of the levy. That is what is available, and we can act on
                it now, at the same time as other matters are progressing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My concern is that the amendment as it is
                couched will not achieve our aim. Had the amendment proposed to
                add more or less the words &quot;to put pressure on NIE&quot; to
                the end of the motion, we could have unanimously agreed.
                However, the wording of the amendment, as an alternative and not
                an addition, could potentially damage the existing levy system,
                whereas the motion reinforces the levy system and allows the
                option for further action. It affords Members the opportunity to
                bring forward whatever further proposals they wish and it
                encourages what is clearly the will of the House: to put further
                pressure on NIE. It also allows the possibility of legislation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly has been asked by Mr McIldoon to
                give a lead to the entire community on the levy. We can only do
                that by supporting the motion unamended, which I urge the House
                to do.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Bradley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the opportunity to bring to the
                attention of the Minister for Regional Development the ongoing
                traffic congestion on the northern periphery of Newry and the
                inevitably worsening situation as the development of the area
                continues. I welcome the Minister’s presence in the Chamber to
                listen to the concerns that I will raise on behalf of the
                residents of the area and the thousands of road users who
                commute daily through this part of Newry, and I thank him for
                his attendance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The traffic chaos in the area is due to a
                lack of forward planning. My earliest memory of the Drumcashlone/
                Carneyhaugh district is one of cattle grazing on the pasture
                lands that lay on both sides of the main Rathfriland to Newry
                road just outside Newry. At that time, there were about 20
                detached dwellings on Rathfriland Road and Upper Damolly Road.
                Similarly, there were no more than 20 homes on Ashgrove Road.
                The infrastructure serving those properties and the then volume
                of through traffic was comprised of three through routes —
                Rathfriland Road, Upper Damolly Road and Ashgrove Road. Changes
                gradually came about as the area began to expand and the demand
                for housing increased. Initially the change was slow, but it
                took off when the Newry and Mourne area plan 1984-99 came into
                being.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In order to present a true picture of the
                ongoing developments, I will detail the number of dwellings in
                each of the developments that make up the area in question.
                There are 85 in Annsville, 65 in Ardfreelin, 35 in Ashbrook
                Mews, 26 in Ashfield Avenue, 46 in Ashgrove Park, 52 in Ashgrove
                Road, 37 in Beechmount Park, 15 in Castleowen, 19 in Cedar
                Grove, 60 in Cherrywood Grove, 77 in Chestnut Grove, 35 in
                Cloverdale, 33 in Drumcashel Villas, 32 in Elmwood Park, 31 in
                Kenard Villas, 33 in Upper Damolly Road, 43 in Willow Grove, and
                27 in the section of Rathfriland Road that covers the area.
                Also, a building site that could accommodate an additional 150
                dwellings is currently being cleared on land that fronts on to
                Upper Damolly Road.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Added to those figures is the comparatively
                new Rathfriland Road Industrial Estate. That development
                includes the premises of one of the largest timber merchants in
                the area and the busy Driver and Vehicle Testing Agency centre.
                There are also haulage yards, a caravan sales compound, small
                factories, purpose-built office accommodation, retail outlets
                and a major filling station/supermarket nearby — all of which
                front on to Rathfriland Road.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are now three large schools in the
                Ashgrove area: Newry High School with approximately 550 pupils;
                Sacred Heart Grammar School with 880 pupils; and St Ronan’s
                Primary School with 408 pupils. There are proposals for another
                large, 800-pupil grammar school to be built in the area. It is
                not necessary for me to describe the traffic mayhem caused each
                day in this confined area as 2,000 or more children, the
                residents of over 700 dwellings and thousands of motorists go
                — or attempt to go — about their daily business.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I said at the beginning, I attribute this
                traffic confusion in the area to the lack of forward planning.
                The Minister, interested parties and those in officialdom will
                best understand what I mean when I tell them that not one metre
                of new through road has been provided in the area for over a
                century. The same through roads that I mentioned earlier remain
                the only ones in this densely populated area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To say that this is unacceptable is to put it
                mildly. I therefore call on the Minister for Regional
                Development to immediately implement a feasibility study of the
                area, with a view to not only resolving the current problems but
                to considering the future needs of the area as it continues to
                develop. In anticipation that my request will not fall upon deaf
                ears, I, as a mere layman — but one with an in-depth local
                knowledge — propose to the Minister that the requested study
                should start by investigating the ring road potential of the
                Damolly Road. If a modern, improved route could be facilitated
                to link the Ashtree roundabout on the Rathfriland Road with the
                main Newry to Belfast dual carriageway, and an improved Upper
                Damolly Road brought to meet the suggested ring road, then many
                of the short-term problems would at least be lessened.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I call for the feasibility study in the full
                knowledge that the Minister is inundated with requests for new
                roads in and around every town and village. However, I am
                confident that the outcome of a Newry-north study would result
                in the Minister recognising that he has a clear-cut obligation
                to deal with the ever-growing traffic problems in the area.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Kennedy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am pleased to add my support to Mr Bradley’s
                call for an urgent study to be carried out by the Minister’s
                Department. I too welcome the Minister’s attendance today —
                his presence shows he attaches some importance to the issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am aware, from my constituents in that
                area, of the chaos that road users experience at the junctions
                on the Rathfriland Road, Upper Damolly Road and Ashgrove Road,
                particularly at peak times. Those roads are important routes
                into, and through, Newry for many commuters. The sheer
                frustration that they experience leaves them almost exhausted
                before they even start a day’s work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over the years, various schemes have been
                introduced in an effort to reduce the chaos. However, none has
                been successful in eradicating the problem. I hope that the
                Minister’s officials will urgently attend to the matter. Such
                action would receive considerable local support, particularly
                from the local authority, Newry and Mourne District Council, of
                which Mr Bradley and I are members. The council has sought, on
                numerous occasions, to resolve the issue at local level with
                Roads Service officials. We have no criticisms of those
                officials &quot;on the ground&quot;, but more lateral thinking
                is required to produce an acceptable solution that will meet the
                needs of the people whose daily lives are disrupted by the
                traffic problems, particularly at peak times.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that the Minister will take on board
                some of the suggestions and that he will initiate a study that
                will take a long-term view of the road network needs of the
                area. I hope that once the consultation process is completed,
                the Minister will act swiftly to carry out its proposals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many of the ad hoc improvements that have
                been made look unsightly. We have, to some extent, created
                barriers and roadblocks in an area of high-quality housing, and
                that has done nothing to improve its general layout. If
                improvements are to be carried out, we must consider that it is
                not enough to simply hammer spikes into the road. Local
                householders, who pay taxes and considerable rates, are entitled
                to take pride in their properties, and to have improvements
                carried out in a manner that they find acceptable.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that the Minister will take these
                under consideration. As an indication of his commitment, perhaps
                he could arrange for officials to look at some of the more
                unsightly ones to see if action can be taken to improve them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am happy to agree with Mr Bradley.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr M Murphy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.
                I also agree with Mr Bradley and Mr Kennedy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The road around Rathfriland is gridlocked,
                and one must experience it early in the morning and in the
                afternoon to appreciate the mayhem. It affects not only local
                residents but also commuters from Belfast to Newry and Dublin
                and vice versa. I must leave very early in the morning to get
                through Newry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Motorists in this area are frustrated and
                bad-tempered at the lack of road structure. The blame lies
                firmly with absentee Ministers who neglected infrastructure here
                for many years. Now that we have our own Minister, I hope that
                he will take on board some of the concerns that were voiced and
                will try to get a feasibility study started immediately. I
                recognise that money is a problem, but I ask him to make this a
                priority. Go raibh maith agat.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister for Regional Development (Mr
                Campbell):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Newry, like many other towns in Northern
                Ireland that have experienced considerable growth and vitality,
                suffers from traffic difficulties at certain locations and at
                certain times of the day. We are all familiar with the traffic
                problems of the morning peak period — the so-called school
                run.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The area in question lies between the A1
                Newry to Belfast road to the west and the A25 Newry to
                Rathfriland road to the east. Approximately 16,500 vehicles a
                day use the A1, while 12,000 use the A25. There is
                cross-movement of traffic between the A1 and A25 through the
                townland of Carneyhough via the Upper Damolly Road, which
                carries approximately 5,000 vehicles a day. In the past, traffic
                also used shortcuts through residential roads. The area is
                primarily residential and has two main schools at Ashgrove
                Avenue. Additional housing is also planned on land that was
                zoned in the 1984-99 area plan. The Newry area plan forms the
                framework for the orderly development of the area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Department has been working on several
                fronts to help to solve traffic problems in the area. To confine
                traffic to the main route, which is the Upper Damolly Road
                through the residential area, the Roads Service made the Control
                of Traffic (Newry) Order (Northern Ireland) 2000 to prohibit the
                use of three residential roads by through traffic. This scheme
                involved extensive consultation and a public inquiry, which was
                held in June 2000.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department has accepted the inspector’s
                main recommendations. Three residential roads will be
                permanently stopped up. The junction of Upper Damolly Road with
                the Rathfriland Road will be improved and signalised. The
                signals will be in place early next year, and will incorporate a
                pedestrian phase to cater for the growing number of
                schoolchildren in the area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another scheme that will have a positive
                impact on the area is the improvement of the road network at
                Trevor Hill, which forms the junction of the Belfast Road with
                the Rathfriland Road. The Department has commenced work to
                increase the road capacity of the two roundabouts in the area.
                That work should be completed by December this year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Following a request from Newry and Mourne
                District Council, my Department intends to consider the
                provision of traffic-calming measures, and the extension of the
                30 mph speed limit, on the Rathfriland Road. Although there has
                already been some residential development in accordance with the
                existing area plan, each planning application is considered on
                its merits in relation to the impact on the local road network.
                Alterations are requested if the development is considered to
                have a significant impact. Road improvements, for example on the
                Damolly Road, have been made a condition of planning approval.
                Work has commenced on the preparation of the Newry and Banbridge
                area plan. The Roads Service will play an important part in the
                area’s future development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department will continue to assess all
                new development planned for the area and will ensure that it is
                carried out without having an adverse effect on the existing
                road network. We will continue our plans to carry out
                improvements at the Upper Damolly Road/Rathfriland Road
                junction, and at the junction of the Belfast and Rathfriland
                Roads. In line with current policy and criteria, we will
                consider traffic-calming measures and will continue to assess
                changing needs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In response to issues raised by Members, I
                want to stress the importance of my concluding remarks. Mr
                Bradley and other Members asked me to consider the possibility
                of a feasibility study of the area. I have outlined some of the
                measures that are being worked on, or will conclude, in the near
                future. As a result of today’s debate, I will ask my officials
                to revisit the area to see if there is anything further we can
                do in addition to the measures that are currently being put in
                place and which should be operational within two to three
                months.</p>
