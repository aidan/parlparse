	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The Assembly met at 12.00 noon (Mr Speaker in the  Chair).</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="1"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Public Expenditure: September Monitoring 2008-2009</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have received notice from the Minister of Finance and Personnel that he  wishes to make a statement on the public expenditure September monitoring round  for the 2008-09 financial year.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel (Mr Dodds)</strong>: With permission, I will make a statement  regarding the outcome of the September monitoring round, following the First  Minister and deputy First Minister&rsquo;s approval of the recommendations by the  less-than-satisfactory means of urgent procedure. I am in a position to  announce to the Assembly a sum of almost &pound;50 million in funding allocations for  local public services across a range of Departments.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In my statement to the Assembly on the June monitoring  round, I highlighted the substantial public expenditure pressure that had come  to light in respect of the Northern Ireland Civil Service equal pay claim, as  well as the impact of the downturn in the property market. In response, the  Executive agreed to adopt a two-stage process whereby only limited allocations  would be made as part of the June monitoring round, with the position to be  reviewed when negotiations with the Treasury were completed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Over the summer and early autumn, work has been ongoing to  address the equal pay pressure faced by the Executive, and discussions are  continuing with the Treasury &mdash; at official and ministerial level &mdash; on how to  minimise the impact on public services. Engagements with the aim of resolving  the issue have commenced with the trade union, and they will continue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The one-off payment to staff could cost in excess of &pound;100  million, although Members will appreciate that that figure is dependent on a  range of factors that we are in the process of considering. The Executive  remain mindful of the need to ensure a fair deal for the civil servants  affected, although there is the potential for a significant impact on public  services from a provision of that amount.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In that context, we are also seeking to ensure that the  public expenditure implications are managed in a way that does not require  reductions to the spending plans for future years that were agreed and  announced by the Executive in January.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It remains my clear belief that the equal pay claim is a  legacy issue for the United Kingdom Government. However, at the same time, we  cannot ignore the broader UK  public expenditure context. In recent weeks, I have met both the Prime Minister  and the Chief Secretary to the Treasury to press the case for Northern Ireland  on equal pay, as well as a range of other measures, including the level and  duration of winter fuel payments.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The equal pay issue involves a large number of complex  issues and thus, as the employee representatives have pointed out, may involve  protracted negotiations. Therefore, although I recognise the desire of staff on  the lowest pay scales to receive payment as soon as possible, a final  settlement may not be reached for some time.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As regards capital receipts, the property market has shown  little sign of improvement since June monitoring, with Departments still  indicating that they expect a significant shortfall against the planned revenue  from asset disposals this year. That, in turn, impacts on the Executive&rsquo;s  investment programme. Although Departments are taking steps to address the  shortfall, the position on housing receipts remains difficult.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The continuing instability in local property and national  financial markets was highlighted last Friday when it was announced that the Workplace  2010 project would be suspended. That will allow time to assess the impact of  recent changes in the financial and property markets on the proposed  procurement. In addition, the continuing media speculation that the remaining  bidders for the contract will come under common ownership had the potential to  affect the procurement process. Although that confirms that the potential &pound;175  million capital receipt for the project will not now be realised in this  financial year, it was no longer possible to proceed uninterrupted with the  project at a time when there was such unprecedented uncertainty in the  financial and property markets.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Workplace 2010 procurement will be reviewed early in 2009,  by which time we hope that the present uncertainties affecting the process will  have been clarified. I remain committed to the principles underpinning the  Workplace 2010 project, and the Civil Service will continue to work towards  creating a modern, flexible working environment for its staff that will enable  the delivery of better public services.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As regards the impact on the Executive&rsquo;s investment  programme, we must recognise that the nature of capital investment projects  means that there will always be some degree of uncertainty in the precise  timing of both expenditure and receipts. Rather than adopt an overly cautious  and conservative position in setting out our spending ambitions for capital  projects for the next decade, the Executive adopted an approach that sought to  encourage Departments to seek to deliver the greatest possible level of  investment in public infrastructure over the Budget period and beyond.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">At the same time, however, the Executive were prudent in  committing funding to projects, particularly in the early years of the period  covered by the investment strategy. In addition, the position on capital  expenditure has been proactively managed during the subsequent in-year  monitoring process. That has meant that over &pound;130 million was available  following the September monitoring round to address potential shortfalls in the  overall capital position for the remainder of this financial year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is also expected that additional capital resources will  become available during the second half of this financial year, as some  projects spend less before next April than was planned initially. Therefore, I  believe that there is sufficient scope to accommodate the loss of the Workplace  2010 receipt during the remaining months of this financial year without the  need for action to scale other projects currently under way.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A further issue that has arisen since June monitoring  relates to Northern Ireland Water, which was previously classified as a public  corporation. Although the final decisions have yet to be made on the future  funding arrangements for local water and sewerage services, Her Majesty&rsquo;s  Treasury has indicated that the company should be reclassified this year as  being within central Government. That is in light of the fact that the company  does not derive a sufficient share of its income from customer charges to still  be considered a public corporation and is, therefore, largely a technical  matter. However, it has real-world implications on the level of Budget cover  required to support the company, the scale of which will be dependent on the  outcome of the ongoing discussions with the Treasury.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members will also be aware of the significant increases in  household energy bills announced in recent months, which has placed an  intolerable burden on households at a time of rising unemployment and  uncertainty in the banking sector. Although it would be pure delusion to  suggest that, on their own, the Executive or the Assembly can resolve issues  that have worldwide impacts, it is also important that we recognise the actions  taken already by the Executive.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those include the freeze on regional rates that was  announced as part of last year&rsquo;s Budget, and the deferral of water charges.  That means that those costs are significantly lower in Northern Ireland than in the rest of the United Kingdom.  In addition, the concessionary fares scheme will be extended this year in order  to provide free public transport for everyone aged 60 and over, while generous  Budget allocations to the Department of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety (DHSSPS) have enabled plans to be put in place in order to abolish  prescription charges.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although there is a need to go further, it is essential that  that is done in a way that leads to a sustainable solution rather than adopting  seemingly attractive quick fixes that build in recurrent costs to the detriment  of the delivery of public services more generally. To that end, I am taking  forward a cross-cutting fuel poverty action plan, which will involve working  with the Minister for Social Development, the Minister of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety, and the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment. Once completed, that work will be submitted for agreement by the  Executive and for consideration as part of the December monitoring round.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is clear that the overall context for the September  monitoring round is, perhaps, even more constrained than was the case in the  previous monitoring round. However, unlike the situation in June, there is now  less scope to defer decisions in light of the emerging pressures that  Departments have identified. As regards current expenditure, the Executive  concluded the June monitoring round with an overcommitment of &pound;85 million. That  figure has been offset by the &pound;41&middot;1 million of reduced requirements that  Departments identified, although the total amount of reduced requirements in  the year to date remains below that in recent years. Further details on the  reduced requirements that were declared in the September monitoring round are  set out in table 1 of my statement.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, the latest forecasts from Departments, as set  out in table 2 of the statement, suggest that little further current  expenditure will be released through to the end of the financial year. However,  Departments indicated close to full spend at this time in the 2007-08 financial  year, yet then declared significant levels of reduced requirements in the later  monitoring rounds, as well as a high level of underspend. In that context,  therefore, I repeat the call for Committees to challenge robustly the  expenditure performance of all Depart&shy;ments in order to ensure that resources  become available for reallocation as early as possible so that we can make the  best use of the resources at the Executive&rsquo;s disposal.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although departmental forecasts have tended to be overly  pessimistic in that respect, there is a need to leave scope in order to address  pressures that emerge later in the year. It was, therefore, agreed that there  were sufficient resources to make &pound;21 million in current expenditure  allocations to Departments, against the &pound;137 million of spending proposals that  Departments submitted.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The allocations that were agreed include a further &pound;5  million for the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety as part  of the first call on available resources agreed in the Budget process; &pound;5  million for extended schools, in recognition of that programme&rsquo;s importance &mdash;  although I remain of the view that those funds could have been found from the  Department&rsquo;s own resources; and some &pound;3&middot;5 million in order to address pressures  in respect of animal health, as the rising market price of animals has  implications for the level of compensation payments.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A figure of &pound;1&middot;5 million was allocated to the flood-relief  scheme for payments to households and district councils after the severe  weather conditions in August, and &pound;2&middot;5 million as a contribution to the  increased cost of the special purchase of evacuated dwellings scheme &mdash; although  I hope that the Department for Social Development (DSD) will take steps to meet  the remainder of the additional costs. In addition, &pound;1&middot;5 million was allocated  to help to meet the increased costs of establishing the new Northern Ireland  library authority, and &pound;500,000 for the re-imaging communities initiative,  which supports local communities as they replace divisive symbols and murals of  the past with images that are a positive celebration of the future. Finally,  &pound;1&middot;5 million was allocated in order to enhance the collection of rates arrears,  with the additional revenue being used to meet the residual costs of Civil  Service reform rather than that pressure being met from the scarce resources  available in this monitoring round.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I explained the approach to managing the in-year capital  position, including holding back more than &pound;130 million to set against the  pressures emerging on in-year budgets due to the impact of the downturn in the  property market and the wider difficulties in financial markets. There is also  continuing uncertainty surrounding the technical reclassification of Northern  Ireland Water.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, there was judged to be scope for limited capital  allocations, and the following were agreed: &pound;15 million to the Department for  Social Development in order to address 30% of the remaining capital receipts  shortfall after proactive action by the Department to minimise the pressure on  its housing programme. In not meeting the full shortfall now, the Depart&shy;ment  for Social Development is being encouraged to continue to maximise its capital  receipts in the current financial year.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department for Regional Development (DRD) will receive  &pound;6&middot;2 million for work at Warrenpoint harbour, which, although fully committed,  has slipped since the 2007-08 financial year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of the Environment (DOE) will receive &pound;1&middot;9  million for the Electronic Planning Information for Citizens (e-PIC) system,  which will enhance the operation of the Planning Service, and &pound;1&middot;9 million for  the implementation of aspects of the cross-departmental Civil Service reform  programme.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The allocations mean that the Executive leave the September  monitoring round with a planned overcommitment in current expenditure of &pound;65  million and an under-commitment of &pound;132 million in capital expenditure.  Although the position on the Workplace 2010 project has crystallised, that risk  had already been incorporated into our plans for the current financial year.  Therefore, confirmation of the Workplace 2010 position will not require  significant changes to be made to our plans, or my recommendations, on the  September monitoring round. However, it does highlight that the downturn in the  property market has affected the public sector as well as private developers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Northern Ireland Departments still plan to deliver their  highest-ever level of investment in capital projects in the current financial  year, which will provide significant help for the local construction sector.  However, it must be recognised that the Executive have limited scope to go  further than their current plans. Following the boom of the past few years, the  construction sector should focus on making the structural changes necessary to  allow it to compete on a sustainable basis over the longer term.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive entered the September monitoring round facing  a range of pressures at strategic level and at departmental level. The wider  financial situation meant that it was not possible to address all those  pressures at this stage. However, a prudent and responsible approach is being  taken, which balances the need to address the immediate pressures faced by  Departments and the creation of sufficient flexibility to accommodate pressures  that may emerge in the remainder of the financial year. I commend the September  monitoring position to the Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Finance and Personnel (Mr McLaughlin)</strong>: Go raibh maith  agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his statement and for the  courtesy that he and his officials afforded the Deputy Chairperson and me in  briefing us on it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Budget for 2008-09 included a planned capital receipt  of &pound;175 million from the Workplace 2010 project. The Minister outlined the  position regarding Workplace 2010, and the project&rsquo;s suspension was announced  last Friday. That was the correct decision, and I agree that it was prudent and  responsible. The Minister also outlined how the shortfall will be managed, and  it is important that the Minister believes that a black hole will not open in  the economy, despite comments to the contrary from some people in the media.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Capital receipts for all Departments in the current  financial year were projected at &pound;486 million. Will the Minister comment on the  extent to which that target will be met and the work of the capital assets  realisation team in that regard? During a recent briefing with the Department  of Finance and Personnel (DFP) officials, the Committee was informed that all  Departments had reassured the central finance group that they would spend their  entire budget in the current financial year. Indeed, the September monitoring  allocations forecast that underspend will be zero after the reduced  requirements have been taken into account. Is the Minister confident that  cross-departmental underspend will be minimal at the end of the current  financial year?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I thank the Chairperson of the Committee for his  contribution. I welcome what he said about the position of the Workplace 2010  project. Given the unprecedented conditions in the financial and property  markets, the decision to suspend that project was correct. Capital receipts  represented less than 10% of the overall gross investment by the Northern  Ireland Departments in 2008-09. Our in-year investment programmes have already  set aside some &pound;130 million to deal with the implications of the volatility in  the property and financial markets.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Slippage on planned capital spending is also likely before  the end of the year. In those circumstances, the issue will be revisited in  early 2009 in order to take stock of the financial position and the two  companies involved in the bidding process &mdash; in that context, there has been  considerable speculation about a merger.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and Personnel  also talked about capital receipts and the downturn in the property market,  which I mentioned in my statement. That situation has improved little since it  was dealt with in the June monitoring round and substantial amounts of capital  funding have been set aside in order to manage it proactively. There will be  reduced in-year requirements coming through and, given the scale of the  projects, some slippage will occur. That ties in with the Committee  Chairperson&rsquo;s last point &mdash; about Departments forecasting that they will spend  their full financial allocations. My statement pointed out that that has been a  recurring theme over the years. Therefore, it is not entirely surprising that  that is what Departments are saying. However, given what has happened historically,  and the nature of the process, it is expected that the position will be much  clearer in the December monitoring round and as we move towards the end of the  financial year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I could stop everything now; halt everything in its tracks,  cease all spending and take up a very cautious position. That may suit me, but  it would not be good for the local construction industry or for Departments.  The best way to manage the situation is through careful monitoring; setting  aside money while recognising the reality of what might happen later on, and  taking a detailed look at the situation in December. That approach avoids  taking money away from Departments; something which I am determined to avoid  doing at all costs. Ultimately, Departments must be able to deliver on the  priorities, objectives and goals of the Programme for Government.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  It is understandable that the Minister&rsquo;s statement has attracted a lot of  interest in the House and quite a number of Members wish to ask questions. I  remind Members that they must ask a question &mdash; not make a further statement or  ask multiple questions. If Members bear that in mind, all those with questions  may get an opportunity to speak.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Speaker. I will do my best to comply.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Minister for his statement and I agree with  him; the agreement of the statement by urgent procedure is less than ideal. All  Executive decisions affecting Departments must be taken at Executive meetings.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister mentioned many emerging pressures and his  discussions with the Treasury on a range of issues. Has he considered asking  the Treasury for greater access to Northern Ireland&rsquo;s stock of  end-year flexibility? I also remind the Minister of the concerns that the  Committee for Finance and Personnel has raised consistently about the lack of  funding for Civil Service reform projects. Will the Minister assure Members  that those projects remain a priority and on-track to be implemented given  their importance in realising efficiencies?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I thank the Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for  Finance and Personnel for his remarks. I agree that it is less than  satisfactory to use urgent procedure in order to proceed with the monitoring  round and allocate money to Departments. It is probably less than they would like,  but &pound;50 million is a considerable amount of capital and current funding that  will enable Departments to manage their budgets and move forward.</p>
	      <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr McClarty] in the Chair)</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is less than satisfactory that the matter is being dealt  with by urgent procedure, because it cuts out the opportunity for discussion,  debate and consideration around the Executive table. It is vital that that  should happen. It is unsatisfactory, by any stretch of the imagination, that  matters cannot be discussed and agreed at Executive meetings.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Hamilton mentioned end-year flexibility; we continue to  press the Treasury on the issue. At the end of the year, any underspend goes  back into the Treasury, and we have to negotiate that. It is all the more  important, therefore, that money that is not required is released during the  in-year monitoring round and reallocated as quickly as possible. We are  negotiating the position on end-year flexibility as part of our ongoing  discussions on equal pay, and it will be extremely important to have access to  the money as quickly as possible.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I assure Mr Hamilton that the Northern Ireland Civil  Service reform projects are proceeding. Civil Service reform is important to  realise efficiencies and, most importantly, to deliver a better service to the  public. At the end of the day, that is what Civil Service reform is all about.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I hope to be in a position shortly to announce progress on  some projects that come under that agenda. As the Member will be aware from my  statement, money has been allocated in this monitoring round to address some of  the issues regarding funding for taking forward cross-departmental,  cross-cutting projects that will benefit all Departments and people across Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement. The First Minister recently claimed  responsibility for almost every good initiative that the Executive have managed  to produce, including free prescriptions, which required a lot of money. Will  he then take responsibility for the frighteningly large black hole of  potentially &pound;500 million in the Executive Budget? What will be his  responsibilities in the crushing effect of the emerging shortfall of a further  &pound;500 million hole in the coffers of the Department for Regional Development?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I thank the Member for his succinct question. It is  not a new question, but I will answer it again for the third or fourth time.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  I will keep on asking it.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I am sure that the Member will keep on asking the  question, because nothing seems to be getting through. Nevertheless, I will  have a go at answering it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is no black hole in the Budget. I should be happy for  officials to sit down with the honourable Member. I sincerely mean that &mdash;  leaving aside the knockabout stuff &mdash; because he is a member of the Finance and  Personnel Committee, and it is important that Committee members have an opportunity  to discuss the process with officials. However, I assure him that there is no  black hole in the Budget.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is nothing new in the idea that Governments face  spending pressures. It happens all the time, and I have been very open about  that in various statements to the Assembly on the in-year financial position.  The Executive have the in-year monitoring process so that resources no longer  required by certain business areas can be used to meet pressures in others.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member talked about a black hole, but we have set aside  &pound;130 million in the capital budget. In 2007-08, &pound;230 million in current  expenditure and &pound;270 million in capital expenditure were declared surplus by  Departments, even before the significant levels of underspend were declared at  the end of the year.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It would be easy to say that I will protect myself and the  Department of Finance and Personnel by stating that there will be no more  spending and that we will ensure that every penny is in place now, or I could  tell the Departments that I will ask for money back. I am not prepared to do  that because the delivery of services to the community is vital.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We will be able to manage our way through this situation.  We have proactively done that already, and we will continue to do so. We will  revisit the situation during the December monitoring round, by which time we  will have a clearer picture. I stress that it is vital that Departments  recognise that we are all in this situation together, and that if there are  areas in which money cannot be spent and is unlikely to be spent, it is far  better to free up those resources so that we can address shortfalls in areas  such as housing where that money can be spent productively and sensibly now.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That is why I decided, even in this constrained situation,  to put another &pound;15 million into housing capital. I took the view that although  we could hold that money back and keep waiting to see what happens, it is  important to keep moving forward and to try to deliver on the objectives of the  Programme for Government.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We will continue to monitor the situation, and, as I said,  I leave open my offer to the Member to meet officials &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  What about DRD?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I understand that the DRD position relates to an  internal document on the strategic stocktake. There will always be emerging  pressures and reduced requirements within Departments. All Departments&rsquo; returns  will come to DFP. We will examine them all, and we will make decisions on that  case. However, as we saw in the present monitoring round, even this year, there  were bids worth &pound;137 million. There will always be pressures and easements; it  is a question of managing them as we go forward.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement, but he has said that &pound;130 million of  capital expenditure will not proceed. That is a statement to the construction  industry &mdash; which is in crisis &mdash; that there will be a spending cut of that  order, largely in respect of construction projects. The Minister must state,  not to me but to that industry, why, instead of expenditure going ahead, as the  industry requested, it is being cut to such a degree.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The current stocktake has been described as nothing more  than a glorified monitoring round. In view of the huge pressures on the Budget,  a few of which the Minister enumerated, such as Workplace 2010, the equal pay  issue, the loss of revenue from property sales &mdash; and one could mention the  property at Crossnacreevy in particular &mdash; will he give us a commitment that he  will bring a revised annual Budget before the Assembly?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I thank the Member for his contribution, but he must  under&shy;stand that there has not been a cut of &pound;130 million in the capital  budget. That money has been set aside and proactively managed to deal with the  issues that are emerging, in year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">No doubt, the Member would be the first person to criticise  me if I were to say that those pressures were emerging, and we had not set  anything aside. He would be the first to ask what type of way that is to manage  public finances. Of course such matters will have an effect. Next he will say  that, if certain Departments &mdash; perhaps some Departments are closer to his heart  than others &mdash; experience reduced requirements, they are, somehow, suffering a  cut.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">What this is really about, as the Member must understand,  is that all Departments, at certain times, experience reduced requirements in  certain areas. That is not to say that they will not have increased demands to  spend money in other areas. Therefore, there is no cut.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As for the capital investment strategy, I wish to be very  clear that the public sector is providing the construction industry with more  than 40% of its total turnover in Northern Ireland. For instance, the  Department of Health has seven major projects under construction this year,  with a total value of &pound;264&middot;6 million. There will be capital spend of &pound;440  million on roads this year. Northern Ireland Water has &pound;127 million available  for the Belfast  sewers project and &pound;90 million for 10 waste-water treatment projects. Contracts  for an additional four schemes, with an aggregated value of &pound;45 million, will  be awarded this year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department for Employment and Learning (DEL) has  projects currently under construction that total &pound;83 million, including South Eastern  Regional College,  South West  College, Northern  Regional College,  and North West Regional College.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The education and library boards have embarked on a major  programme of works with a total value of &pound;120 million. The Department of  Education (DE) will, shortly, work on other programmes and PPP projects that  are worth &pound;84 million at the contract-award stage.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Let us not allow party-political point-scoring to paint a  different picture of the situation. Over the next three years, &pound;925 million  will go into housing in order to meet the objectives of creating 10,000 new  affordable social houses by 2013, and &pound;5&middot;5 billion will be spent through the  investment strategy over those three years.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  Perhaps.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The Member says &ldquo;perhaps&rdquo;, but is it not far better  to aim for a progressive, ambitious programme than to say that &lsquo;we will spend  only &pound;3 million and will keep all the other money back&rsquo;? I could take a far  more cautious approach. I am taking a prudent approach, as are the Executive.  Through that, we will try to move ahead as much as we can in order to help to  deliver the infrastructure projects that the Departments and the public want,  at the same time helping our construction industry. Let us not be senseless  about the &pound;130 million that the Member mentioned. It is not a cut; it  represents prudent management, given our current situation.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  The Department of Finance and Personnel has committed to giving the Department  of Health, Social Services and Public Safety first call on the &pound;20 million that  is available in the monitoring rounds. According to the Minister&rsquo;s statement,  it appears that that new money will be phased in, or, in practice, backloaded.  Is that not self-defeating for the health budget?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Bearing in mind the existing flexibility that is available  to the Minister, as well as the new money in the monitoring rounds, how will we  ensure transparency in the manner in which that money will be spent? The public  is confused about the situation in which an announcement about free  prescriptions is followed a week later by news of cuts &mdash; including the possible  loss of 700 nursing posts &mdash; in front-line services.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The allocations to the health budget are part of the  commitments that have been made in the overall Budget process. The Department  of Health, Social Services and Public Safety has already allocated that money  in its budget, so the extra money will simply go into that budget. There is no  issue, because that Department knows that that money is coming.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  is responsible for the announcements that have been made, and Dr Farry and his  colleagues should raise those issues &mdash; and the question of transparency &mdash; with  Mr McGimpsey.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, to go back to Mr O&rsquo;Loan&rsquo;s contribution, I should  have made the point that &pound;100 million of the &pound;130 million that he mentioned is  coming out of end-year flexibility from previous years. Therefore, it is even  less of a concern to him than it would otherwise be.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure (Mr McElduff)</strong>: Go raibh  maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Will the Minister explain why &pound;1&middot;5 million  was allocated to the new library authority? It is my understanding that the  nature of a monitoring round is such that allocations are made on the basis of  unforeseen and unanticipated pressures. How could such sudden circumstances  have arisen with regard to the new library authority?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In my capacity as a private Member, will the Minister tell  me whether he received a bid from the Minister of Health, Social Services and  Public Safety for health and community-care centres? The establish&shy;ment of  several of those centres has been put on hold, including projects that were  earmarked in the Western Health and Social Services Board area for Carrickmore  and Fintona, which are in County   Tyrone.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I will answer the Member&rsquo;s second question once I  have taken advice on the matter.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">To answer his first question, the bid that was made was  partly successful. The reason for the request was that the creation of the new  library authority will require five redundancies at senior level. Those are  inescapable calls on the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure (DCAL).</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If that bid were not to proceed, the anticipated savings  that would otherwise be made by the establishment of the authority could not be  realised. There is a difference between sudden pressures that may or may not  emerge and inescapable pressures. It is not a matter of anyone&rsquo;s being taken by  surprise; it is just that those pressures have crystallised at this time. There  are other issues that we may know about, but when they crystallise is another  matter; and they may only come to be decided during an in-year monitoring  round.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McQuillan</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his sensible approach to public finances. Given the  downturn in the property market, why can the Executive not simply borrow more  to implement projects to help the construction industry?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: There are several approaches that could be taken on  the financial position. More money could be raised through the regional rate or  through increases in manufacturing or business rates. However, the Executive  have taken the right decision in those regards by freezing the regional rate  over the next three years and capping at 30% the industrial de-rating for the  manufacturing industry as well as business rates.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">No one in the Assembly can print money &mdash; although I was  reminded that there may be some people who may, but not legally. Under the  reinvestment and reform initiative, the Executive could seek more borrowing  from the Treasury; a substantial amount has already been borrowed under that  facility &mdash; about &pound;250 million. It would not be wise, in the present  circumstances, to increase that, and in so doing meet considerable resistance  from the Treasury on public expenditure issues. That is unlikely to be a  runner.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Northern    Ireland receives a block grant &mdash; a finite amount  of money. Money could be raised through rates, but that would be at the  margins. Therefore, we have to manage the money over the three-year period,  recognising that we do not have the resources to accrue new money unless it is  given to us through the Treasury. That is one of the reasons underlying the  call for a Budget process &mdash; despite the decision of the Executive and the  Assembly to reject that process this year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A Budget is decided on when setting out new governmental or  Executive priorities. Surely no one is suggesting in the current circumstances  that what the Executive are trying to do with the allocations that they have  made and with the general thrust of trying to push the economy forward needs to  be revisited. What do need to be revisited are the in-year pressures and how  those are addressed. If Members are telling me that we need fundamentally to  revise the allocations that were agreed in the Programme for Government, they  should be upfront in outlining where they propose to cut money and where they  propose to put it, because that is the only thing that can be done in a new  Budget round. I would love to hear the Members who call for that revision  outline where they would like to see more money spent and where they would cut  the Budget. If they want a new Budget round, that is what they will have to do.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement, and I support the view that having a fire  sale of Government assets would be futile at this time. Will the Minister  dispel the media speculation about the bidders coming under common ownership as  a result of Workplace 2010 and that it will, therefore, not be necessary to  re-advertise that important contract?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I thank the Member for his question, which, if I may  say so, is a very important one.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Since the idea was first mooted and the bidding system set  up, the process has taken many twists and turns, including the withdrawal of  one bidder. The recent decision to suspend procurement, which I announced at  the end of last week, was prompted by a significant development in the sale  process of one of the companies.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">12.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member mentioned a fire sale. Given the fact that the  cost of borrowing has risen steeply and that there has been a downturn in the  property market, it is right to suspend now and take stock again early in 2009.  I remain committed to the view that we are on the right lines in trying to  obtain a modern estate in which civil servants can work better and deliver a  more efficient service to the community.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If the two bidders were to merge, the contract could still  be awarded; it is not uncommon to procure through sole-source negotiations. One  example of that is the procurement process for the aquatics centre for the  London 2012 Olympics. We will carefully consider and assess our position when  the intention of both bidders becomes clear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement. He referred to the figure of &pound;1&middot;5  million that was allocated to the DOE for flood relief in August. No reference  was made to a request from the Depart&shy;ment of Agriculture and Rural Development  (DARD)regarding flood relief for farmers, who have perhaps suffered more than  some householders. Was any request made from that Department?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My colleague Declan O&rsquo;Loan mentioned the DARD-owned  property at Crossnacreevy. Will the Minister confirm whether consideration of  the value of that property disrupted his entire thinking on the monitoring  round? Will the reduction in value by an estimated &pound;195 million result in an  ongoing loss?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The receipts for the sale of the property at  Crossnacreevy will not be realised in the current financial year and do not  fall within this year&rsquo;s in-year monitoring process. However, it is important to  take the matter into account when considering the strategic stocktake. I am  sure that the Department of Agriculture will be raising the issue as part of  its strategic stocktake, and it would be entirely sensible for it to do so.  That is matter for that Department because it came forward with that proposal.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am delighted that, at the time of the flooding, the  Executive were in a position to move quickly to ensure that a payment was made.  It was not the purpose of the scheme for that payment to be compensation, but,  in August 2008, an immediate payment was made where there was evidence of  suffering of severe inconvenience. That payment to councils is an inescapable  bid.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I met the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development in  relation to the monitoring round, and she pressed me on the priority of the  allocation to animal health. To date, I have received no business case relating  to flood relief for farmers, and, therefore, I am not in a position to consider  a bid sensibly and properly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Like other Members, I have much sympathy for, and  understanding of, the concerns of farmers. However, farmers cannot be  compensated by the Executive; just as we cannot compensate householders. I can  only respond to the view that a payment should be made if it is pressed on me  as a priority ahead of other priorities and if I have a business case on which  to make a decision. As yet, no business case has been forthcoming.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement. The sum of &pound;1&middot;5 million that has been  allocated to enhance the collection of rates arrears compares with a bid from  Land and Property Services for &pound;2 million in the June monitoring round. Will  that be entirely adequate to meet the backlog in rate collection, which is part  of the Minister&rsquo;s potential income?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I also notice that the Minister called for Committees to  robustly challenge the expenditure performance of Departments. Will he remind  his fellow Ministers of the importance of ensuring that Committees get adequate  time to carry out that process, given that that has not been the case for  several Committees so far?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, on a technical point, will the Minister ask his  staff to examine the figures in table 2 of his statement? It seems that several  figures have misplaced decimal points, which suggests that Departments are  doing better than they actually are.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minster of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Mr Ford&rsquo;s concern about the decimal points has been  duly noted. If the figures are wrong, they will be corrected.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The importance of reducing the level of rates arrears as  quickly and by as much as possible has been raised in Committee and elsewhere.  A certain amount of rates arrears will be accrued every year, because some  people, by nature, will not pay as quickly as others. Steps have recently been  taken to reduce substantially rates arrears. The extra money allocated will  reduce rates arrears even further. It is important that we do that. The money  will also fund the reform agenda of Departments.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Like Mr Ford, I am also concerned that Committees do not  have sufficient time to challenge Departments&rsquo; expenditure performance. We must  work to ensure that Committees have sufficient time to examine those issues. I  know that the Committee for Finance and Personnel has done some work on that. I  have pledged the full co-operation of my officials with the Committee on that  piece of work.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement. Mr Ford&rsquo;s point about rates arrears  collection is a reminder about the importance of rates relief for small  businesses. From reports, I understand that rates relief is available to small  businesses in England, Scotland and Wales. Will he comment on, or give  an assessment of, the possibility of rates relief for small business in the  future?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, the statement makes no mention of roads  maintenance, despite the serious deterioration of roads, particularly minor and  rural roads, and how that is linked to road safety. What are the Minister&rsquo;s  views on that?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I thank the Member for his question. I was  sympathetic to many of the suggested bids. From my statement, the Member will  be aware &mdash; as Ministers are well aware &mdash; that the Departments collectively  proposed &pound;137 million worth of bids. All Ministers presented strong arguments  for their particular bids. Some arguments were more valid than others, but,  nevertheless, they were strongly felt.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, there came a point when I had to say that if I  were to allocate funds to a particular bid, for which there was no surplus  money, I would have to remove it from somewhere else. Departments have the  flexibility to reallocate money. If a Minister decides that something is of  pressing concern and requires higher priority spending, he or she is at liberty  to examine reallocations internally within his or her Department.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Forgive me, but I forget what the Member&rsquo;s first question  was.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  It was about small businesses.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I thank the Member for the reminder. The Member will  be aware that that matter is under consideration, along with several other  rates relief issues. After consultation with, and consideration by, the  Committee, my Department recently announced several decisions on rates relief.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A number of other issues are still to be decided, one of  which is rates relief for small businesses. A report has been carried out, and  it has raised issues about how effective rates relief would be in helping small  businesses, as opposed to just putting money into the hands of landlords.  Therefore, the issue needs to be considered. There are other schemes, as the  Member said, and we will be considering them carefully.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must be mindful that every time we do things like this &mdash;  and there may well be good arguments for doing so &mdash; it means less revenue for  the Executive and the Assembly to distribute than would otherwise be the case.  On the one hand, the Member is calling for more money to be spent on roads  maintenance; on the other, he wants us to not raise as much money as we  otherwise could through other ways. It is always important to bear in mind that  the money that we allocate has to come from somewhere; it does not grow on  trees, and we cannot raise the amounts that we need by ourselves. We have a  finite, block amount of money, and when we allocate money to one area, that  inevitably has an impact on another area in the public expenditure round.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Given that the monitoring round deals with unforeseen pressures in spending,  has the Minister received any advice from my Ulster Unionist colleague in Lagan Valley?  I hope that he does not take too much of that advice if he receives it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister indicate whether the Minister of  Agriculture has raised with him the possible &pound;28&middot;5 million disallowance that  the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development may face following an EU  audit into single farm payments? We are all shocked to hear that no bid has  been submitted for flood relief when the Committee was informed that that was  going to be the case. With respect to extended schools funding, will the  Minister tell us where the Department of Education may find the &pound;5 million in  its own resources as indicated in his statement?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The Department of Agriculture did submit a bid for  flood relief. However, when I met the Minister of Agriculture, highest priority  among the bids submitted was given to payments to the animal-health sector.  There is presently no business case forthcoming; therefore, we are not in a  position to make a sensible decision on the matter in this in-quarter  monitoring round.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member raised another important point &mdash; the emerging  issue of the potential common agricultural policy disallowance of the single  farm payment. My Department will work with the Department of Agriculture to  assess the current and future implications of that disallowance. We will advise  the Department on the need for a provision, or a contingent liability, for the  amount involved. We will assess the financial implications and consult with the  Treasury and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs on the UK position and  what assistance they may provide. Now that that issue has emerged, we will  offer assistance.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Everyone agrees that the extended schools programme has  been extremely useful. I met primary school teachers and head teachers in my  constituency recently to discuss that and other issues. I made a point about  the Department of Education&rsquo;s budget, which is relevant to other issues  floating about regarding the extended schools programme and issues affecting  the boards. My reason for saying that the money may have been available is that  the Department&rsquo;s resource underspend in 2007-08 was &pound;50 million, some 2&middot;8% of  the final allocation, and its resource underspend in 2006-07 was even greater  at 4&middot;3%, some &pound;70 million. Past performance indicates that there would be more  than sufficient scope for the Department to meet those costs and others as well  as emerging pressures.</p>

	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Presumption of Death Bill</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Extension of Committee Stage</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Finance and Personnel (Mr McLaughlin)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That, in accordance with Standing Order 33(4), the period  referred to in Standing Order 33(2) be extended to 16 January 2009, in relation  to the Committee Stage of the Presumption of Death Bill (NIA Bill 23/07).</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. The  Presumption of Death Bill completed its Second Stage on Monday 15 September  2008 and was referred to the Committee for Finance and Personnel for its  Committee Stage. The Bill has 20 clauses and three schedules, and its purpose  is to provide a legal framework through which the needs of the families of the  disappeared, as well as the families of other missing persons, can be addressed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My Committee has engaged closely with the Department of  Finance and Personnel on the Bill&rsquo;s development and has received oral and  written briefings from departmental officials on its provisions. Committee  members raised several issues during those briefings, and the Department  provided further clarification on those matters.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, the Committee is aware of some important issues  that have not been addressed fully. For example, the Department is working on a  new clause that confers on the High Court the power to order someone who is not  a party to the proceedings to disclose relevant information to the court.  During the Committee&rsquo;s public consultation on the Bill, other issues were  raised by the Human Rights Commission and the WAVE Trauma Centre, which acts on  behalf of the families of the disappeared. The Committee has sought a formal  response from the Department on those issues, and, as a follow-up to the  submission from the WAVE Trauma Centre, it has agreed to take oral evidence from  family representatives.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee reviewed its heavy work programme for the  current session and agreed to give priority to its consideration of the  Presumption of Death Bill. Other work pressures on the Committee include:  another Bill that is at its Committee Stage; two new, pending Bills; an ongoing  inquiry; the Budget stocktake; and the in-depth scrutiny of several policy  areas in the Department of Finance and Personnel.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee requires additional time to liaise further  with the Department on the issues that have arisen from the evidence that it  received on the Bill, including the proposed new clause on the disclosure of  information. Therefore, I seek an extension to the deadline for the Committee  Stage to 16 January 2009 so that the Committee has sufficient time to reach a  considered position and report on the Bill to the Assembly. That revised  timetable has been agreed with the Department. The Committee aims to conclude  its deliberations and report to the Assembly as soon as possible in advance of  that deadline. I ask Members to support the motion. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That, in accordance with Standing Order 33(4), the period  referred to in Standing Order 33(2) be extended to 16 January 2009, in relation  to the Committee Stage of the Presumption of Death Bill (NIA Bill 23/07).</p>

	      <p class="Q3Motion">That, in accordance with Standing Order 33(4), the period  referred to in Standing Order 33(2) be extended to 20 March 2009, in relation  to the Committee Stage of the Civil Registration Bill (NIA Bill 20/07).</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Civil Registration Bill is the other Bill that has  reached Committee Stage and that the Committee for Finance and Personnel is  considering. The Bill comprises 31 clauses and two schedules, and it will  provide a more flexible legislative framework for the civil registration of  vital events, including births, deaths, marriages and civil partnerships. It  aims to provide improved service delivery, better access to services and  information, as well as introducing new and more responsive services.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee engaged closely with the Department on the  Bill&rsquo;s provisions and received written evidence from stakeholders, including  the Council of Irish Genealogical Organisations, the Association of  Professional Genealogists in Ireland,  and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee will wish to follow up with the Department  issues that arise from that written evidence. It may also require oral  evidence. Moreover, the Committee has already indicated its intention to  examine various measures and safeguards that will be required as a result of  provisions in the Bill in order to protect the public from the risks of data  disclosure and fraud.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have already explained that, given the Committee&rsquo;s  considerable work pressures at present, it has had to prioritise its business.  Following consultation with the Department, it was agreed that the Presumption  of Death Bill would be given priority over the Civil Registration Bill.  Therefore, I seek an extension of the deadline for the Committee Stage to 20  March 2009, to allow the Committee sufficient time to reach a considered  position and to report on the Bill to the Assembly. That revised timetable has  also been agreed with the Department. The Committee will endeavour to conclude  its work on the Bill in advance of that deadline. That will depend on the progress  that can be made on other business that is before the Committee and on any  unforeseen pressures on its work programme. I ask Members to support the  motion.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That, in accordance with Standing Order 33(4), the period  referred to in Standing Order 33(2) be extended to 20 March 2009, in relation  to the Committee Stage of the Civil Registration Bill (NIA Bill 20/07).</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading"><a name="4"></a>Health and Social Care (Reform) Bill</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Extension of Committee Stage</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mrs I Robinson)</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That, in accordance with Standing Order 33(4), the  period referred to in Standing Order 33(2) be extended to 5 December 2008, in  relation to the Committee Stage of the Health and Social Care (Reform) Bill  (NIA Bill 21/07).</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Health and Social Care (Reform) Bill passed its Second  Stage on 1 July 2008 and was referred to the Committee for Health, Social  Services and Public Safety on 2 July 2008. The Bill is a major piece of legislation  that contains 35 clauses and seven schedules. It deals with the reorganisation  and restructuring of the health and social care reform system. The Bill&rsquo;s  stated purpose is to provide the legislative framework in which the proposed  new health and social care structures will operate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Prior to the Bill&rsquo;s introduction, the Committee heard  evidence from several key organisations that are likely to be affected by its  provisions. Following its introduction, 30 organisations responded to the  Committee&rsquo;s requests for written evidence during the summer recess. The Committee  has taken further evidence from key organisations and is now undertaking its  formal clause-by-clause scrutiny of the Bill. It is conscious that the  Department aims to have proposed changes in place by 1 April 2009. It  recognises that that will be a tight timescale. The Committee is also mindful  that proposals to restructure the health and social care system have been under  discussion for some time; previously, by direct rule Ministers, and, at  present, by the Health Minister.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I know that the lengthy period of uncertainty has caused  great anxiety and concern for many of those who will be affected by the proposed  changes. Therefore, the Committee aims to complete the Committee Stage as  quickly as possible, while, at the same time, giving due consideration to the  detail of the proposals. That process is nearing completion. I therefore seek a  short extension of the deadline to 5 December 2008 in order to allow sufficient  time for the Committee to complete its consideration of the views that have  been expressed and to compile its report on the Bill. I ask Members for their  support.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>

	      <p class="H5StageHeading"><a name="5"></a>Report of the Committee on Procedures on its Inquiry  into Private Legislation</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30  minutes for the debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes in  which to propose and 10 minutes in which to make the winding-up speech. All  other Members who wish to speak will have five minutes.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee on Procedures (Lord Morrow)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly approves the Report of the Committee on  Procedures on its inquiry into Private Legislation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee on Procedure&rsquo;s second report of the current  mandate examines how the Assembly should deal with private Bills. On behalf of  the Committee, I ask the Assembly to approve the report on private legislation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Private legislation should not be confused with a private  Member&rsquo;s Bill. A private Bill&rsquo;s purpose is to obtain particular powers for an  individual, corporate body or association of persons. It seeks exemptions or  benefits in excess of, or in conflict with, general law, and it can relate to  the estate, property, status, style or otherwise of the promoter&rsquo;s personal  affairs.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the main, private Bills are likely to concern: the  legislative arrangements for charities, colleges and churches; powers sought by  local authorities; and general company law. Private Bills often seek exemptions  from, or additional powers to, public law: in 2007, for example, the National  Trust introduced to Westminster a private Bill  related to its governance structures in Northern Ireland. Had the Assembly  been restored at that stage, the Bill would have come before it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although private Bills are not routine in other  legislatures, they are not uncommon, and a private Bill will probably be  introduced to the Northern Ireland Assembly sooner rather than later. However,  research suggests that it is unlikely that any more than four, or at the most  five, private Bills per mandate &mdash; if even that many &mdash; will be introduced to the  Assembly. With that in mind, the Committee on Procedures recently conducted an  inquiry into private Bills and today seeks the Assembly&rsquo;s approval of the  resulting report. If approved, the aim is to produce Standing Orders to govern  the progress of such Bills through the Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will not attempt to cover all of the report&rsquo;s 26  recommendations in detail. Other legislatures informed the Committee that  elected Members may first become aware of a private Bill only when it is  introduced. Therefore, the Committee on Procedures recommends that, before a  private Bill is introduced to the Assembly, it should undergo a preliminary  scrutiny to ensure that it is appropriate. In other words, the person or body  that promotes the Bill must prove that it is required, that no alternative  means of meeting that requirement exists, and that it concerns a matter on  which it is appropriate for the Assembly to legislate. The promoter of the Bill  must also prove that appropriate consultation has taken place with those  affected by the Bill and that all relevant documentation has been provided to  the Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When the promoter has provided such proof, the Speaker will  introduce the Bill by announcing that it has been received and will be  published, and that a private Bill Committee will be established. The Committee  on Procedures recommends a period of 60 days between the introduction of the  Bill and the debate at Second Stage. That may seem excessive, but considerable  work must be done between those stages. Those who would be adversely affected  by the Bill have the right to lodge an objection and have 42 days in which to  do so. The private Bill Committee will assess the objections and agree on  whether they are valid.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Unlike public Bills from the Executive, private Members or  Committees, the provisions of a private Bill will probably be completely new to  all MLAs. Therefore, the private Bill Committee will be asked to produce a  report on its principles to assist the Assembly during the debate at Second  Stage. The Assembly will vote on the principles of the Bill at Second Stage,  and it will either pass or fall. If the Assembly approves the principles, the  Bill will be referred to the private Bill Committee for its Committee Stage.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee on Procedures recommends that a private Bill  Committee comprising five members is created each time a private Bill is  introduced. That template is similar to a private Bill Committee in the  Scottish Parliament and the UK Parliament. In keeping with tried and tested  procedures and processes in those jurisdictions, the Committee recommends the  introduction of a specialist role for private Bill Committees in the Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">1.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A private Bill is different from a public Bill, which  covers policy and addresses issues that affect a large number of people. A  private Bill affects a small number of people on a personal and direct level, and  that is at the heart of why a private Bill Committee will behave differently to  a public Bill Committee.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Based on examples from other legislatures, objectors to  private Bills are, normally, ordinary individuals rather than the lobby groups  or interest groups that give evidence to Statutory Committees during the  Committee Stage of a public Bill. Those individuals object to the Bill because  it directly and adversely affects them. The Bill may affect their property or  cause the loss of an amenity or an increase in noise levels.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The objectors can present their case to the private Bill  Committee. Furthermore, they can bring witnesses to support their case and hire  legal counsel to present the evidence. The promoters of the Bill will have the  same privileges, and, after both presentations, the objector can cross-examine  the promoter, and vice versa. Thereafter, the Bill Committee will decide which  side to support.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Another major difference is that the private Bill Committee  can make amendments to a Bill rather than going to the Assembly for approval.  The reasons for that policy are outlined on page 16 of the report. If a Statutory  Committee wants to make an amendment to a Bill, the Minister and Committee  members debate it in the Chamber. The Committee argues for the amendment, and  the Minister has ample opportunity to defend his or her position. Based on that  debate, Members vote for or against the amendment. That process is not  available to the promoter of or objector to a private Bill. Those persons must  outline the argument to the private Bill Committee, and only members of that  Committee will have the opportunity to hear both sides directly. Therefore, the  private Bill Committee is best placed to make a decision on amendments.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, MLAs will have an opportunity to table amendments  to the Bill during the Consideration Stage. The Committee on Procedures  recommends that there be a minimum of five working days between the Committee  Stage and Consideration Stage. During that time, any Member can table an  amendment under the normal rules for tabling amendments to public Bills. The  debate on the private Bill at Consideration Stage will follow existing  procedures on public Bills. However, if there are a substantial number of  amendments, or they are of a technical or substantive nature, the Bill can be  referred back to the private Bill Committee. Again, that provision arises  because of the personal nature of private Bills and because they affect a small  number of individuals personally and directly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The promoter and objector must be allowed an opportunity to  declare that an amendment tabled by a Member may disadvantage them. Moreover,  an amendment tabled by a Member may affect a new group of objectors who,  therefore, must be allowed to present their case. The Committee on Procedures  recommends that the Further Consideration Stage follow existing procedures  except that technical or corrective amendments only are allowed. Final Stage,  Consideration Stage and Royal Assent for private Bills will follow current  procedures.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The report recommends that private Bills are not subject to  Standing Orders on accelerated passage. All other legislatures charge a fee for  private Bills, and the Committee on Procedures believes that it is reasonable for  the Assembly Commission to do so. The Committee has consulted the Assembly  Commission and agreed that the fee for promoters &mdash; which can be reduced by 75%  for charitable-type bodies &mdash; will be &pound;5,000.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The fee that is recommended for lodging an objection is  &pound;20. That is not enough to cover administrative costs, but it should &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member draw his remarks to a close?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  However, setting the fee at &pound;20 should deter frivolous objections. The  Committee on Procedures recognises that a fee of &pound;20 may represent a substantial  amount for retired people or those on benefits, so it has agreed that objectors  can band to submit a single objection.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I recognise that my time has elapsed; however, other points  still need to be made. Perhaps I will get a chance to make them when Members  ask questions.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I call Mr Mickey Brady.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: It  is Mr Brolly who is speaking in this debate.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I call Mr Francie Brolly.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brolly</strong>:  Mickey cannot read.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat. The passage of private  legislation is unlikely to cause Members to spend long days and late nights in  the House. Rather, it will occur rarely, if at all. Nevertheless, it is  important that procedures are in place to deal with it. I commend the work of  the Committee on Procedures and its staff to produce a framework within which  private legislation may be processed and advanced. I ask the House to approve  the report.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Private legislation will have limited impact on the general  legislative estate. However, the issues that promoters of private Bills submit  to the House will be important and, in some cases, vital to those promoters.  Therefore, it is important and commendable that the Committee on Procedures has  been meticulous in the preparation and presentation of its report. The  preliminary scrutiny, under the leadership of an Assembly official, to be known  as the examiner of private Bills, is a useful safeguard against the waste of  Member and staff time on proposals that are insufficiently significant,  frivolous or have no prospect of approval. The promoters&rsquo; fee of &pound;5,000 may  also act as a deterrent in some such cases.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I ask the House to approve the report.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>: I  thank the Clerk to the Committee on Procedures and her staff for the huge amount  of work that they put into the report. I also thank the Chairman, who has  precisely outlined the fairly complicated issue of private Bills.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee researched and compared practice in other UK legislatures  and in the D&aacute;il. The Assembly&rsquo;s opinion was sought on the recommendations,  particularly on the subject of fees. I am pleased that the Committee took into  account the Assembly Commission&rsquo;s view, especially on a reduction in the fee  for charitable organisations. Committee members were keen to facilitate  objectors, and, in recommendation 21, the fee for objection has been set at  only &pound;20.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">This type of legislation is not frequently enacted. As the  Chairman of the Committee on Procedures said, in 2007, the National Trust  introduced at Westminster a private Bill that  related to its governance structures in Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The legislative stages for private Bills are set out  clearly. In keeping with the experience of other legislatures, a raft of  private Bills is not anticipated. The report merely recommends provision of  procedures that exist in other elected institutions. We have taken advice from  a wide range of relevant sources. The Committee is strongly of the view that  preliminary scrutiny is vital before introduction of a Bill to the Assembly;  and it believes that the promoter of the Bill should meet the necessary  criteria. Any private legislation should meet all the normal standards that  Executive legislation must meet. Private legislation should go through all the  procedures that apply to all other legislation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee has also drawn up criteria for objections to  Bills. I support the report that is before the Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Browne</strong>:  As a member of the Committee on Procedures, I also thank all of the Committee  staff for their commitment and patience during the inquiry, which commenced in  May 2007. As part of its research, the Committee arranged visits to the  Scottish Parliament, Westminster  and the D&aacute;il. I was privileged to visit those legislatures along with the other  Committee members.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">From the evidence received, I concur with the Committee&rsquo;s  recommendation that the Stages of a private Bill should reflect those that are  in place for public Bills in this Assembly. Those include preliminary scrutiny;  followed by introduction, which is the First Stage; then the Second Stage;  Committee Stage; Consideration Stage; Further Consideration Stage; and the  Final Stage. Pre-introductory scrutiny is normal for public Bills, and it would  be wise to have a similar stage for private Bills. To do otherwise could mean  that Members might only become aware of a private Bill when it was introduced.  As stated in the report, evidence from the Scottish Parliament suggests that  preliminary scrutiny can smooth the passage of Bills.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I do not intend to through each proposed Stage that the  report details, but it is worth highlighting some of the recommendations. One  of those recommendations was that, at Committee Stage &mdash; in line with Westminster and the  Scottish Parliament &mdash; the promoters and objectors should be allowed to call  witnesses and cross-examine each other under the direction of the Committee.  They should also be allowed legal represent&shy;ation when presenting their cases  to the Committee.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee gave detailed thought to the issues of  cross-examination and legal representation, particularly concerning the  management of the private Bill Committee and the matter of equality of arms for  objectors who may not be able to afford legal representation. That is an issue  that may require further consideration.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, it is also worth noting that the Committee did not  make any recommendation about the involvement of the Assembly&rsquo;s Legal Services  in the cross-examination process. The Committee left it to the discretion of  the private Bill Committee to decide whether &mdash; based on the specifics of the  private Bill &mdash; the promoters and objectors can undertake the cross-examination  under the direction of the Chairperson, or whether that is better done with the  assistance of Legal Services.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Another recommendation is that a private Bill should be  introduced via an announcement from the Speaker that a private Bill has been  received and will be published. A further recommendation was that there should  be a minimum of 60 working days between a Bill&rsquo;s First and Second Stage. My  noble friend Lord Morrow has already said that the National Trust introduced a  private Bill in Westminster in 2007 that was  related to its governance structures in Northern Ireland. I am sure that  all Members of this House wish that all such private Bills could be dealt with  by this Assembly in future.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The report puts a robust process in place, with an  effective and efficient set of procedures that will enable private legislation  to come before this House. I therefore support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  At the outset, I concur with the other Members of the House who have  congratulated the staff of the Procedures Committee in appreciation of work  that they carried out.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The procedures for private Bills are not the most  stimulating or interesting of topics. However, people outside this Chamber will  appreciate the discussion of any legislation, let alone legislation that comes  from the normal legislative process.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">1.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Nevertheless, the Assembly is a legislature, and it should  have proper procedures in place to enable private Bills to be introduced. That  is the aim of the Committee&rsquo;s report, which provides a working policy for  private Bills, and which, if agreed by the Assembly, will enable the Committee  to begin drafting the appropriate Standing Orders.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When undertaking its inquiry, the Committee on Procedures  visited the House of Commons, the Scottish Parliament and the Irish Parliament,  as Lord Browne mentioned. We spoke to Members and officials from those  legislatures about the operation of private Bills, which was a great help to  all members of the Committee. Private Bills and the procedures relating to them  are not easy to get a grip of but, on behalf of the Committee, I thank those  who gave their time and advice to assist us with the inquiry &mdash; it certainly  made the Committee&rsquo;s task much easier.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In developing the procedures that the Committee is  recommending to the Assembly, we tried as much as possible to follow those that  are currently in place for public Bills. However, because of the special nature  of private Bills, that was not always possible. That is particularly evident in  respect of the procedures recommended for private Bill Committees, which are very  different from the Standing Committee procedures in the Assembly, but there are  good reasons for that. A few examples of private Bills from other legislatures  may help to illustrate that point.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the Scottish Parliament, for example, several Bills have  been promoted by the private-transport companies for light-rail links. One such  Bill involved a small number of local people who objected, either because part  of their garden was being vested or because they were going to be subject to  additional noise in their homes or business from the operation of the transport  scheme. The private Bill Committee had to listen to parties on both sides and  decide which argument was the most reasonable.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">During the clause-by-clause examination of the Bill, the  Committee was then able to decide whether amendments were necessary. The  amendments were technical because the Bill was, by its nature, very technical.  The Bill was factual and detailed provisions such as the number of square feet  that would be taken from Mr and Mrs Smith&rsquo;s garden. The amendment, therefore,  had to be just as factual. The private Bill Committee&rsquo;s decision that the rail  line would be moved 3 ft away from Mr and Mrs Smith&rsquo;s land subsequently  affected someone else. That Bill, and other similar Bills in Scotland, took  up to two years to be passed. Members will be glad to know that such Bills are  unlikely here in Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">An example from Westminster  concerned four local councils that were seeking additional powers to control  peddlers and street traders. An example from the Irish Parliament involved Trinity College seeking to change its governance  arrangements. Trinity   College was founded by a  charter, which had to be changed using a private Bill. There was a substantial  number of objections to that private Bill, which gave the Government more  management control, and the Bill took almost 18 months to complete its passage.  Everyone employed by Trinity was entitled to object and a substantial number of  people did so. The private Bill Committee had to listen to all the objections  and make a decision that came down on one side.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Such examples provide some indication of the wide range of  subjects covered by private Bills. The procedures recommended in the report  mirror those used by the House of Commons, the Lords, the Scottish Parliament  and the Irish Parliament, and are designed to meet the usual needs of private  Bills. The procedures have not simply been plucked out of the air but are based  on good practice elsewhere, as well as the unique character of private Bills.  By their very nature, private Bill Committees have a quasi-judicial nature,  because they adjudicate between competing private and/or personal needs. A  private Bill Committee will, therefore, behave very differently from any other  Committee that considers a Bill.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That said, a large number of private Bills receive no objections  and can complete their passage in a matter of months. Our Committee report  includes recommendations about how private Bill Committees would operate when  no objections have been received.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, the circumstances in which Members should be  allowed to serve on a private Bill Committee are important, because Members  must protect themselves from possible accusations of looking after their own  interests at the expense of other people&rsquo;s interests. The procedures  recommended by the Committee are based on the model outlined in rule 9A.5 of the  Scottish Parliament&rsquo;s Standing Orders.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Private Bills deal with Members&rsquo; personal concerns, and  therefore, Members who serve on a private Bill Committee must be impartial and  neutral, which is different from their normal political advocate&rsquo;s role. The  example of land vesting by transport companies in Scotland, which I quoted earlier,  illustrates that fact.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Brolly and Mr Neeson referred to fees, and the Committee  on Procedures discussed that matter for a considerable time. The Committee  concluded that it is appropriate to charge fees. Unlike public legislation,  private Bills affect a relatively small number of people. In fact, such Bills  afford extra powers, or exemptions from existing laws, to individuals,  companies and organisations. Therefore, it is inappropriate to fund such  legislation from the public purse.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The promoters of private Bills will be expected to pay  drafting costs and a fee towards the Assembly&rsquo;s administration costs. The  report recommends a fee of &pound;5,000 plus associated costs, such as the printing  of a Bill. Having discussed the issue with other legislators, the Committee  discovered that it is unlikely that that fee would cover the Assembly&rsquo;s  administrative costs. However, drafting a Bill &mdash; for which a promoter would  have to pay &mdash; can cost more than &pound;40,000, so the Committee considered it  inappropriate to ask for more money, particularly, as Mr Neeson said, because  such costs might prevent charities and smaller organisations from introducing  private Bills. For charitable organisations that might find it difficult to pay  even a &pound;5,000 fee, the Committee recommends that the fee be reduced by 75% to  &pound;1,250.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The recommended fee payable by objectors to a private Bill  is &pound;20. That caused considerable discussion in the Committee, because members do  not wish to disadvantage anyone or make it difficult to object. Nevertheless,  frivolous objectors must be deterred. Other legislatures&rsquo; experience  demonstrates that some people object simply for the sake of objecting and not  because they are in any way disadvantaged. Objections should be received only  from those who have a clear and direct interest in a Bill. In order to address  concerns that people might be unfairly disadvantaged by the fee, the Committee  recommends that a single fee should be allowed to cover several objectors.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee on Procedures recommends that the stages for  introducing private Bills follow those in place for public Bills. We do not  expect many private Bills to be introduced; however, familiarity with the  stages that existing Bills undergo will assist us in smoothing the passage of  what we hope will be rarely used procedures.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Nevertheless, some procedural differences are required to  make the process work. For example, preliminary scrutiny is necessary. It would  be unusual to introduce a public Bill without prior warning; however, that is  not the case for private Bills. In other legislatures, private Bills are often  introduced with no warning, and, therefore, preliminary scrutiny ensures that  several prerequisites are in place: the Bill must be appropriate; all  documentation must be completed; the fee must be paid; the Bill must meet the  requirements stipulated in Standing Orders; and, most importantly, proper and  full consultation must have been undertaken. The Committee recommends that  private Bills should not introduced until promoters have proven that the  aforementioned points have been satisfied. After introduction, given the  likelihood that most Members will know little &mdash;</p>

	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are many things that I could say, and which I would  like to say, during the debate, but, in deference to the wishes of the families  of the disappeared &mdash; some of whom are here today &mdash; it might be better that they  remain unsaid. I have spoken to the families, and I will be guided in what I  say by their wishes and desires for the debate. As you did, Mr Speaker, I ask  other Members to also be so guided. The wishes and desires of the families are  that this motion and debate will focus attention on their plight and help open  the hearts and minds which are still closed to their pain to divulge important  information that has not been forthcoming. Such information will aid the  process of the recovery of the remains of their loved ones.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Throughout the history of what we call the Troubles, many  individuals have been killed, and many families and communities have struggled  with the aftermath. The overwhelming majority of families have had the  consolation of waking and burying their dead in accordance with the rights of  the faith within which they were raised. Although those ceremonies may not have  wiped away every tear, they provided the possibility of closure on the grief,  sorrow and pain of the traumatic death of a loved one. The families of the  disappeared who have not yet had the remains of their loved ones returned to  them have not had even that possibility opened to them. They have been left &mdash;  in many cases for decades &mdash; pondering the whys and wherefores of their loved  ones&rsquo; disappearance, wondering about their fate, arriving at their own  conclusions and awaiting the recovery of their remains.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The words of Se&aacute;n O&rsquo;Casey&rsquo;s famous poem &lsquo;A Rare Time for  Death in Ireland&rsquo;,  which was written over 80 years ago, are strangely prophetic of the disappeared:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;You will be unknown for ever &nbsp;&nbsp;You  died without a word of praise &nbsp;You will  be buried without even a shadowy ceremony &nbsp;No bugle will call your name &nbsp;No gunshot will let loose brave echoes over  your grave &nbsp;You will not be numbered  among the accepted slain.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those of us who have experienced deep sorrow at the death  of a loved one can never imagine the anguish that the families of the  disappeared have had to endure over the years. In our sad situations we have  been enwrapped in the support and concern of our communities. In some areas,  however, the community from which people have disappeared has been silenced by  the omert&agrave;: whatever you say, say nothing.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the end, it has been left to the families to speak for  their loved ones, and I hope that what Members have to say today will add to  their voices in the same dignified way in which they have spoken.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">1.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We can but stand back and admire the families&rsquo; endurance,  patience and great dignity in the face of prolonged anguish. They are not, as  they are entitled, asking for even justice or retribution; they are asking only  to be able to bury their loved ones with dignity. Surely that is not too much  to ask in a civilised, Christian country.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those who, quite rightly, demand justice, equality, human  rights and the truth about the past must ensure that they, too, afford the same  rights to others who yearn for them. Now is the time for those who have said  nothing, or who have not said enough, to speak and come forward with vital  information. The families of the disappeared ask all of us in public life &mdash;  including Members of the House &mdash; to assist them in several ways. Where they  can, they should publicise the mechanisms by which information can be given to  the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims&rsquo; Remains. Mr Speaker,  the commission&rsquo;s confidential telephone number, which I hope that you will  permit me to read into the record, is 00800 55585500, and its address is ICLVR,  PO Box 10827, Dublin 2.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The families have told me that we can also help by  reinforcing in all publicity on the disappeared that any information given to  the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims&rsquo; Remains is privileged  and can be used only for the recovery of the bodies of the disappeared, and  cannot be passed on to any other agency or authority.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The commission has a team of forensic experts working on  its behalf, and that new methodology, which it is hoped will prove effective,  can work only with information. Any information, no matter how small or  insignificant it may seem, could be the key to the recovery of remains. The  commissioners and the forensic team are halfway through their timetable of  work. If, at the end of their tenure, bodies have still not been recovered,  there is an onus on the British and Irish Governments to continue to support  the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims&rsquo; Remains. The families  ask all of us in public life to support the continuation of the commission.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I use, as I am entitled to, the platform that this debate allows  in order to appeal to anyone, including Members of the House, who has any  influence over those who were involved in the actions that led to the  disappearances to redouble their efforts, to return to their sources, and to  help to ensure that no effort is spared to bring closure to the families.  Likewise, I ask anyone who may have information, to use the mechanisms already  outlined, or any other channel with which they feel comfortable, in order to  convey that information to the commission. The families have waited long  enough; they deserve closure. Let us do all in our power in order to help them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The remains of Seamus Wright, Kevin McKee, Columba McVeigh,  Brendan Megraw and Danny McIlhone have not been returned to their families.  Charles Armstrong and Gerard Evans, both from Crossmaglen, disappeared in County Armagh.  No one has admitted responsibility for their disappearance, and their remains  have not been returned to their families. The remains of Seamus Ruddy, who was  killed by the INLA, have not been returned to his family.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Robert Nairac, a member of the SAS, also disappeared in County Armagh,  and his remains have not been located. Legal proceedings are ongoing in that case.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The disappearance of Lisa Dorrian from Ballyhalbert in 2005  may have had loyalist links. Her family still await the return of her remains.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Speaker, I am sure that you share my hope that today&rsquo;s  debate will move and change hearts and minds so that the information necessary  for the return of the remains of the families of the disappeared will be  forthcoming.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Agus ar&iacute;s eile, a Cheann Comhairle, gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leat  as an deis a thabhairt domh inniu c&aacute;s na dteaghlach a chur os comhair an T&iacute;  agus os comhair an tsaoil.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Speaker, I thank you again for affording me the  opportunity today to highlight the plight of the families of the disappeared.  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  I support the motion, and I urge those with any relevant information to bring  it forward as swiftly as possible so that the bodies of those known as the  disappeared can be returned to their families for burial. I agree with Dominic  Bradley that it is important that we maintain the right tone in this debate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The story of the disappeared started in west Belfast, on 2 October  1972, with the disappearance of Kevin McKee and Seamus Wright and their  subsequent murders. They were both republicans from west Belfast, but they were accused by the IRA of  being informers and were murdered by the IRA. The next murder happened in  December of that year, and that time the victim was Jean McConville, a widow  and the mother of 10 children. She was taken from Divis Flats by the IRA and  shot dead.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Up until 1972, the IRA had a policy of shooting suspected  informers and leaving their bodies by the roadside as a public warning to  others who might be tempted down the same path. However, in 1972, that policy  changed, and there is one man in this Assembly who knows only too well how that  came about &mdash; the Member for West Belfast Gerry Adams.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Adams had joined the IRA  in 1966, and he went with the Provisionals in 1970. The following year he was  the IRA commander in Ballymurphy, and he became second in command in the Belfast brigade staff.  Then, in 1972, he became the Belfast  commander. As such, he was in command of the IRA when McKee, Wright and Jean  McConville were murdered. In the wake of the Four Square Laundry affair, Adams  set up two secret IRA units, each comprising four members; one was based in  west Belfast and the other in north Belfast. Their role was  to carry out special tasks, such as the murder of suspected informers and the  disposal of their bodies. The fact is that, apart from Captain Robert Nairac  and Lisa Dorrian, all of the disappeared were members of the nationalist and  republican community, and with one exception, they were murdered by the IRA.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">At a recent conference in Carlingford to mark the fortieth  anniversary of the civil rights movement, the former Stormont MP Austin Currie  spoke of an elderly mother who went to her grave mourning her son, who was one  of the disappeared. Austin Currie described the murders and the disposal of the  bodies as the worst violation of human rights during the Troubles. That is why  some of us find Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s support for human rights somewhat hypocritical &mdash;  republicans have been guilty of some of the most appalling human rights abuses  in the history of this country.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A daughter of Jean McConville said of Gerry Adams:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;It was common knowledge in our area he was an IRA  leader at the time. When he came to my house, he went to the bathroom for about  15 minutes the moment he arrived and when he came out he insisted that he had  nothing to do with my mother&rsquo;s disappearance. But he couldn&rsquo;t look me in the  eye and I just didn&rsquo;t believe him.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">She did not believe him, and neither do I. Of course, Gerry  Adams has always sought to distance himself from the whole gruesome episode,  but the fact is that we do not believe him.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">More than 3,600 people died during the Troubles, and almost  half died at the hands of the IRA. The violence is over, and for that we are  glad, but is it not time for Adams to show  some remorse for those crimes? Is it not time that he showed some remorse for  the evil that was inflicted on so many families by the organisation that he  commanded?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On 25 September, Gerry Adams called for the setting up of  an independent international truth commission on the Troubles. He said that he  wanted the truth, so perhaps he will tell us today what he knows about the  disappeared. Perhaps he will tell us what he knows about the perpetrators of  those crimes. Those people know where the bodies are buried, and only their  information can lead to the bodies of the disappeared being brought home for a  proper burial.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that the motion will not be passed simply as a  formality. Rather, I hope that it will yield some results and that some people,  particularly the Member for West Belfast, will do what they can and tell us  what they know so that movement can be made in that direction.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. I had hoped that you would intervene &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  I have finished my speech.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Given your ruling at the start of the debate, I had hoped that you would  intervene on the Member&rsquo;s speech. Some of the Member&rsquo;s comments are unhelpful  and not in keeping with the tone in which the debate was set.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I said at the beginning of the debate &mdash; and I am mindful of this fact &mdash; that  this is a very sensitive matter, and it is important that Members from all sides  of the House act responsibly. Mr Adams is the next Member to speak, and I am  sure that he will answer any allegations that need to be answered.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Adams</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Bh&iacute; m&eacute; ag &eacute;isteacht leis an m&eacute;id a d&uacute;irt  an fear amaideach sin. Ba mhaith liom a r&aacute; an-soil&eacute;ir go raibh s&eacute; m&iacute;cheart sna  ruda&iacute; a d&uacute;irt s&eacute;. T&aacute; m&eacute; ag caint i bhfabhar an r&uacute;in seo, agus aonta&iacute;m gur rud  millteanach br&oacute;nach &eacute; clann gan uaigh acu le cuairt a thabhairt uirthi n&aacute; le  paidir a r&aacute; ag a taobh.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Before speaking in support of the motion, I deny and refute  the assertions that were made by the Member for North   Belfast. I commend and support all the families who have suffered  a grievous injustice and who have campaigned with dignity for many years to  locate the remains of their loved ones. I welcome those people to the Public  Gallery. Once again, I acknowledge the grave injustice inflicted upon those  families, and I express my deep regret about that. I thank everyone who has  worked to help the families, including the Independent Commission for the  Location of Victims&rsquo; Remains, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and all the experts and staff  who provided assistance. Those people deserve our full support.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For its part, the IRA has apologised for the grief that it  has caused; it has acknowledged that its intention in working closely with the  special forensic investigating team has been to rectify that injustice; and it  has accepted full responsibility for its actions. I know that that is of little  consolation to the families who are involved. Those families want and deserve a  Christian burial for their loved ones. I also believe that the IRA has provided  a full disclosure of all the information that is available to it and that  republicans continue to work diligently on this important and heartbreaking  issue. That fact was recognised some time ago by Geoff Knupfer, the forensic  science investigative consultant who works for the independent commission. He  said:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;in a spirit of cooperation and reconciliation they  are trying to help in every way they can. I am absolutely convinced that they  are doing everything they can to assist. The support we have had from them has  been absolutely 100% from day one.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I make it clear, a Cheann Comhairle, that none of that  minimises the IRA&rsquo;s responsibility for the suffering endured by those families.  Mr Knupfer also acknowledged the incredible difficulties and challenges facing  the search teams. He stated:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;I think that probably  in some cases&hellip;the people directly involved have died. If you&rsquo;re reviewing  events that took place 30 years ago, then memories do fade and locations change  and that&rsquo;s one of the things we have identified pretty rapidly &mdash; that sites  have changed dramatically.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Despite that, a Cheann Comhairle, let me make it very clear  that it is imperative that efforts to find those remains continue. Such efforts  must also continue in cases in which the IRA has said that it is not involved.  The disappearances of Seamus Ruddy, Charlie Armstrong and Gerard Evans are a  source of as much trauma and grief for their families as that endured by other  families.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The suffering of those families has gone on for too long.  They have a fundamental right to bury their loved ones, and there is an onus on  those responsible to help bring that about.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It was stated earlier in the debate that the remains of  four people have been found. However, the bodies of Seamus Wright, Kevin McKee,  Columba McVeigh, Brendan McGraw and Danny McIlhone remain missing. Contrary to  suggestions that have been made by some Members, there must be no doubt that  republicans continue to work to ensure that the families of those men can give  them Christian burials as soon as possible. I assure those families that, even  as I speak, republicans continue to work towards that. They do so by visiting  sites, meeting regularly with the experts involved in the searches, and doing  everything possible in order to bring closure to the families involved. I also  offer an opinion that is based on work already done &mdash; the locations identified  by republicans contain the burial sites.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, I repeat my call to anyone with any information to  bring it forward. Sin &eacute;, a Cheann Comhairle. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I welcome this very solemn debate. The Ulster Unionist Party supports the  motion. The issue before Members is serious. The aftermath of any terrorist war  involves a search for many victims of the conflict, not least for the families  of those victims who have become known as the disappeared. That is an important  part of the healing process after a conflict. It is not an issue that can be  brushed under the carpet as inconvenient or uncomfortable for the current  political set-up. On the grounds of human dignity and human decency, it must be  addressed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The depth of suffering for many families of the disappeared  cannot and must not be airbrushed out of history. It is very real, and the  hearts of Ulster Unionists go out to those families who have been deprived of  even the most basic human right &mdash; being able to grieve properly for their loved  ones. The callousness of those murders was bad enough, but to compound that  with a failure to surrender their bodies for burial adds insult to injury.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important for Members to issue a clear and  unequivocal call, as representatives of a democratic process embedded in human  rights and freedom, for every individual and every organisation who can  contribute to resolving the issue of the disappeared to bring forward the  necessary information without any further delay. Structures to enable that to  happen have been in place since August 2006, when the British and Irish  Governments agreed to a series of key measures to ease, and to make more  accessible, the process of providing information.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those measures included the retention of experts and the  establishment of a project team to work as part of the Independent Commission  for the Location of Victims&rsquo; Remains in order to develop the commission&rsquo;s  recommendations. Confidential telephone lines were created and widely  advertised in order to enable people to share information on the whereabouts of  the bodies of the disappeared with the commission. Where beneficial, other  experts and resources have been added to the measures available to the  commission, including the collection of DNA samples from the closest biological  relatives of those whose bodies have yet to be recovered. Medical and dental  records are also available.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Independent Commission for the Location of Victims&rsquo;  Remains was established in 1999 by treaty between the United Kingdom Government  and the Government of Ireland. Such measures are welcome, but, frankly, they  have proven to be insufficient.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Frank Murray is an independent commissioner, as is Sir  Kenneth Bloomfield, who said:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Everything that can be done is being done to locate  the bodies of the Disappeared.</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">Every possible lead and fresh piece of information is  being investigated and areas, often of bogland or other difficult terrain,  surveyed by a dedicated team who are committed to doing all that they can to  bring closure to the families and find the remains of their loved ones.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, efforts are being made, but they must be  supported. The energy and commitment of former terrorists and their political representatives  have been questioned by the relatives of some of the disappeared. Therefore, I  call on Sinn F&eacute;in to respond specifically to that matter. Recently, Sinn F&eacute;in  representatives have made many comments on the importance of other parties in  the Executive adopting a proper attitude towards them, but if Sinn F&eacute;in were to  address the issue &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Will the Member draw his remarks to a close?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  If Sinn F&eacute;in representatives were to address the issue of the disappeared in a  more effective and committed way, it would help in some small way to improve  how those parties perceive them.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  thank the proposers of the motion for bringing the matter to the Assembly. The  situation with respect to the disappeared is one of the most frightening and  troubling aspects of Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s history during the past four  decades. As other Members have stated, people must reflect on, and never  forget, the degree of suffering that has been experienced by the families  because of the brutality of the murders and the failure to bring closure.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is extremely troubling for people when they cannot bury  someone whom they know in their hearts they have lost. Indeed, the mother of  Columba McVeigh went to her grave last year without getting closure. I spoke to  her several years ago, and, to her dying day, she retained the hope that her  son&rsquo;s remains would be returned to her. She was unable to move on with her life  during the 30-year gap between his disappearance and her death, and that is  extremely sad.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When we talk about dealing with the past &mdash; and I hope that  this is something that the Eames/Bradley Consultative Group on the Past will  consider &mdash; we must bear in the mind that the disappeared must be very much to  the forefront of efforts to bring closure to the Troubles in Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly can deal with the matter of death certificates,  and it is important to note that the individuals whose remains have not yet  been recovered have not been formally declared dead because of the absence of  those remains. Hopefully, the Presumption of Death Bill will address that  situation. However, that is only one aspect of bringing closure on this  important issue. The most crucial aspect is the recovery of the remains so that  the victims can be given a proper burial.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I note with interest and encouragement the IRA apology and  the words that have been said by Mr Adams from Sinn F&eacute;in, but I would like  those words to be extended to try to deal with that for which the IRA was  responsible in our society. However, a start has been made in that respect.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It has been nine years since the Independent Commission for  the Location of Victims&rsquo; Remains was established, and, aside from two sets of  remains that were found in 1999 &mdash; one set of which were handed over in a coffin  &mdash; progress has been sparing. One must ask why there has been a delay during  those nine years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If the co-operation is there and is as fulsome as has been  described, I would like to think that we will see much more progress than we  have seen to date.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must reflect extremely seriously on the situation with  Jean McConville &mdash; the travesty of the searches finding no remains and the body  being recovered several years later.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to take this opportunity to reflect also on the  situation that relates to one of my former constituents, Lisa Dorrian from  Conlig, who has been missing for more than three years. That case reminds us  again that the problems of the disappeared are not merely a legacy of the 1970s  and early 1980s; they are very much alive in recent memory. There are people  who know what happened to Lisa Dorrian. Hopefully, their consciences will  eventually be pricked, and they will come forward with the information to give  members of her family the closure that they seek. I praise the work that is  being done by Lisa Dorrian&rsquo;s family and others to keep her case very much  alive. However, there is always a danger, as time goes on, that such cases fade  from memory. The message going out from today&rsquo;s debate is that we should keep  the memory of all the disappeared very much alive and to the forefront of  people&rsquo;s minds.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I note with some concern that the remit of the Independent  Commission for the Location of Victims&rsquo; Remains extends only until 1998 and,  therefore, does not include the case of Lisa Dorrian. Perhaps that matter  should be considered by the two Governments in the coming months.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  I, too, congratulate the Member for bringing this matter to the House. I certainly  do not wish to change the tone or tenor of the debate, because I recognise that  we are debating an important and solemn issue this afternoon.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">This is an era in which we hear much about human rights. It  is interesting to note that those who shout the loudest about such issues are  strangely muted &mdash; to put it mildly &mdash; when it comes to the issues regarding the  disappeared. If ever there was a violation of human rights, that is surely one  of the greatest.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I listened intently to what Mr McCausland said, and I  waited for Mr Adams&rsquo;s reply. Alas, although Mr Adams said that he refuted what  Mr McCausland had said, he did not elaborate on why he refuted it. As we travel  through life, our pasts can sometimes come to haunt us, our consciences can  often prick us, and we can often find ourselves in difficult positions. Mr  Adams&rsquo;s party claims to want human rights; this would be a good place to start.  This would be the time to show that it not only wants human rights for its own  group and organisation, but that it wants them to be extended to all and  sundry.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I wonder whether Sinn F&eacute;in regards the disappearance of  individuals as a crime. I cannot help but refer to an instance when one of its  members was asked whether he classified the murder of Jean McConville as a crime.  His answer was, &ldquo;I do not&rdquo;. Therefore, a mother of 10 is taken from her home  and she has never been seen or heard of since, and that is not a crime.  Frankly, if that is not a crime, I am at a loss to understand what a crime  really is. How could anyone take a mother from 10 young children who needed her  most, when her alleged crime was that she stopped to give assistance to a  soldier, or someone who was in trouble or who had been shot? That was Jean  McConville&rsquo;s crime. God help society if we have not moved on from that. I  thought that this society was supposed to be moving on. However, it seems that  some things will not change.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I, too, met the family that was referred to earlier. I  listened to the pain and anguish of the mother, who was more than 80 years of  age, as she yearned for her son whom she would never see again. She reminded me  that her husband died of a broken heart because their son had been taken away  and had never been seen again. She said that she hoped and prayed, before her  time came, that her son would be returned. She said that she did not want  vengeance; she just wanted to be able to bury her son and visit the graveyard  on a Sunday afternoon to place a bunch of flowers in memory of one whom she  loved dear.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is a responsibility on Sinn F&eacute;in. It knows something.  Society is crying out, and the families of the disappeared are turning to Sinn  F&eacute;in directly for help. Nothing that Nelson McCausland said changed the tone of  the debate, but we are saying to Sinn F&eacute;in directly that it must give more. It  knows more than it is telling those families, and it must give them assistance,  and tell them exactly where their loved ones are. That is not too much to ask.  Sinn F&eacute;in would demand it if the situation was the other way round.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The families of the disappeared are not asking for  vengeance. They are not asking for very much. Nevertheless, Sinn F&eacute;in has a  responsibility to assist those families in every way that it possibly can in  order to ensure that their loved ones get a funeral. That is all that they are  asking for &mdash; a place that they can visit.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I appeal to Sinn F&eacute;in to give whatever information it can  today.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  As colleagues have done, I offer my sincere sympathy to the families of the  disappeared. The situation has been a heartbreaking one for those families over  the past years. I appeal to many Members to put themselves in the families&rsquo;  position for a short time, and to think of the anguish and pain that they have  gone through, not just in recent months and years, but over decades. Think of a  situation in which you, as a member of society and as a family member, have a  loved one taken away from you for no reason at all, and then have to listen to  the speculation and rumours that abound, sometimes from within your community,  the media, or from some of those people who are supposed to be &ldquo;in the know&rdquo;.  However, the heartbreak still goes on for the family members. I appeal to  anyone who has any knowledge of these matters, inside or outside the Assembly,  to come forward with it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome Dominic Bradley&rsquo;s motion, but that in itself is  not enough. The families of the disappeared have suffered over the years.  Sometimes they have been offered a chink of light, and, thankfully, in some  cases, that has been successful. However, others have been given high hopes and  thought that they were going to receive positive news, but, all of a sudden,  their hopes were brought back down again. That is one of the worst situations  that a person could be in. Having lived with despair for years, all of a sudden  there is some hope that the body of a loved one can be brought home for a  Christian burial, only to have that hope taken away.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Please let us not get into that situation again, if at all  possible. We want to give those families real hope, and that is what I am  asking for today. Let us give those families some satisfaction that they can  bring their loved ones home.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Watching the despair of some of those families witnessing  searches, it is not helpful for them, morally or psychologically, to have to do  that, and then to be brought back down with no positive result.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The circumstances of the disappearances must also be  considered, and colleagues on this side of the Chamber raised some of those  issues. Please do not let us return to a situation in which people are taken  from their loved ones and, we assume, murdered for no reason. Thankfully, the  Province has moved on somewhat from that, but we want to keep it moving on. Do  not let us fall back into the despair that we had for several decades. We cannot  allow society to do that. If one thing can be taken from this affair, it is the  positive nature of what has happened over the past few years, and the fact that  we are trying to move on. However, almost as a mirror image of some of those  things that have happened to the families of the disappeared, we have been  brought back down again by people pushing the Assembly into stalemate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If we are to move on, let us move on not only the political  situation, but with for those families that have experienced years of despair,  discouragement and anxiety. Let us give them some hope, as well as the rest of  society.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I fully support the motion, and congratulate the proposer for bringing it to  the Chamber. The wording of the motion says everything that should be said on  the matter. It is a shame and disgrace that the motion even needs to be brought  to the Assembly to be addressed. I add my sympathies and support to all those  who have lost loved ones, and who are unable properly to grieve and achieve  closure.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It has been said that there is only one certainty in life,  and that is death. A day is appointed for each of us to pass from this life and  on to the next, and the best for which one can hope is to be remembered,  perhaps with a fond memory and a smile, by those who are left behind. However,  as with many things in life, things do not always go the way that we plan or  had hoped. We have families and children devastated by the loss of a parent. It  is a horrible fact that people die every day in the Province, but what is more  horrible is that the bodies of those who have been murdered, and who are now  the disappeared, lie in the cold earth, their whereabouts unknown to their  families.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am told that there are five stages of coming to terms  with grief &mdash; denial, anger, bargaining, depression and, perhaps, acceptance. It  takes varying times in order for a person to go through those stages. Grief  cannot always be measured or compared, as everyone takes it differently.  However, what is even worse is that the grief of the families of the  disappeared is as real today as it was on the day that their loved ones  disappeared.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Most people gain some closure at a wake and funeral, as  they say goodbye to their loved ones. Although that is not the end of the  grief, it is a major part of the expression of that grief. I support the motion  because too many families in the Province have not been allowed properly to  grieve the loss of their loved ones. There are those whose fathers, sons,  brothers, mothers, daughters or sisters were murdered, and who have not had the  chance to gain closure at a funeral because there has been no body to bury.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I dislike the term &ldquo;the disappeared&rdquo;. It lends itself to an  image of a sort of abduction, but that is not the case. It is not something  from &lsquo;The X-files&rsquo; or anything like that. People on Earth can answer to this  matter, and they can solve the problem. Those people were taken and murdered by  people connected to this Province, and someone in this Province knows the  location of each of those who have been disappeared.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">They have not vanished into thin air; their remains are  somewhere, and there are those who know where they are. Having remains would in  no way bring the loved one back, but it would bring the mourners some comfort  in being able to carry out a Christian burial, and to have somewhere to go to  lay flowers and shed tears. The matter is really about common decency, and the  right to have respect in life and death. It is clear that those who carried out  those murders have no respect for life, but they should at least allow for the  sanctity of someone resting in peace, which gives relatives a sense of peace.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Who holds the information? For the sake of decency, I plead  with those who have the knowledge and the information to allow families to gain  closure, and to bury their loved ones&rsquo; remains in an acceptable fashion.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are those who have information and others who are  able to exert influence on those who have the information. I urge those people  and all Members to do the right thing to allow families to have a proper  resting place that can then become a point for their grief.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Farry mentioned Lisa Dorrian, and I know that case from  my constituency of Strangford. I have met the Dorrian family, and I am aware of  the grief from which they suffer each and every day. I urge those who have  information on that case to come forward.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is much talk in Northern Ireland about moving  forward, and that is right and proper, but I have always maintained that that  should be done while remembering and respecting the past. Whether Catholic or  Protestant, male or female, and no matter what creed or colour, people should  be allowed to grieve and come to a place of acceptance. That cannot be done  while wondering where one&rsquo;s husband&rsquo;s remains are.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For the sake of the Province and of families that are torn  apart, let us have no more talk of the disappeared. Let us have honesty from  every section of the community and allow people their human right to grieve.  Whoever you are and whatever you have done, you have the chance to eventually  do the right thing. Take it, and let those people have their time to mourn  properly. I support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  As Question Time commences at 2.30 pm, I suggest that the House takes it ease  until then. The debate will continue after Question Time, when the next Member  to speak will be Mr Alex Attwood.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The debate stood suspended.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenAnswersHeading"><a name="7"></a>Oral Answers to Questions</p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading">Office Of The First Minister And Deputy First  Minister</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Conflict Transformation Centre</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mr  McClarty </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister  what action it is taking to ensure that the conflict transformation centre at  the Maze does not glorify terrorism.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO855/09>(AQO  855/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister (Mr M McGuinness)</strong>: With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle,  before I answer the question, I take this opportunity to express, on behalf of  my family, our deepest appreciation and thanks to you and to all Members of the  House for the many expressions of support and condolences that I received after  the recent death of my mother.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The master plan for the regeneration of the Maze/Long Kesh  site includes the proposed international centre for conflict transformation. It  is envisaged that the centre will have international, local and community-level  conferencing facilities, and that it will offer research, study and academic  activities. For example, it is envisaged that it will host summer schools and  study visits, offer research fellowships, facilitate archiving and provide a  shared space for visitor access, events and exhibitions. The objective of the  proposed centre is to promote and encourage peace building so that other  nations and regions across the world suffering from conflict will benefit from  the experience gained here.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McClarty</strong>:  In light of the very real concerns about the conflict transformation centre  becoming a shrine and a centre of controversy, will the two First Ministers  consider delisting and removing the existing buildings so that everyone has the  opportunity to move forward?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: At present, an extensive programme to demolish buildings and  structures is under way. That will be completed in this calendar year. The  first phase of substantial remediation work to remove contamination at part of  the site is also near completion.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Recently, we approved a &pound;3&middot;5 million second-stage  remediation programme that is essential to prepare the site for future use. As  the funding suggests, second-stage remediation is extensive and will entail,  for example, the removal of diesel oil spillages and contaminates from other  parts of the site.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Given the recent downturn in the global economy, those  essential public works will not only provide employment in the building sector  but will help to promote confidence in the economy here.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The delisting of buildings on the site, however, is a much  more controversial aspect. If we are to resolve the issue over what to do with  the Maze/Long Kesh site, as I hope that we can, we must examine the holistic  aspect of the site and the enormous advantages that it offers to the Assembly  and the Executive.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  I thank the deputy First Minister for his answer. Is he aware that members of  the Sinn F&eacute;in club at Queen&rsquo;s University, in describing a visit to the H-blocks  at the Maze on their website, paid homage to the bravery of the hunger strikers  and the prisoners, and said that the resistance and the resilience of the  prisoners were a constant source of inspiration? Does the deputy First Minister  agree that, in using words such as &ldquo;homage&rdquo; and &ldquo;inspiration&rdquo;, it is clear that  members of his party already regard the H-blocks as a republican shrine?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: I strongly believe that this part of the world has much to offer  the international experience. Many Members, from all sides of the House, have  been invited to various parts of the world to offer their contributions and  experiences, which have allowed people to consider whether those experiences  hold any lessons for them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">From my involvement with people, including unionist members  of the House, it appears that there is a demand for our contributions and  experience, which will exist for the next 10 or 20 years. A strong argument  exists for the establishment in the North of a conflict transformation centre  that has international appeal.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Efforts to attract support for a centre would be undermined  if the Long Kesh site were turned into a shrine to whomever. The European Union  has already expressed its support for a centre. Its task force has indicated  that it would be suitable to site a centre here.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I do not want anybody to do or say anything premature. I am  unaware of the comments that were recorded by students after a visit to the  H-blocks; no doubt people will record their own experiences when they visit the  site. The important thing for me is that we do not have a shrine at the Long  Kesh site. We want a meaningful centre for conflict transformation where people  from other parts of the globe can learn from our experiences, and, in doing so,  bring enormous benefits to us in the North. Such a centre would be a massive  focus for international attention and bring many more visitors to this part of  our island.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  welcome the deputy First Minister&rsquo;s statement implicitly criticising those who  wish to turn part of the Maze site into a shrine. Earlier, in his substantive  answer to Mr McClarty, the Minister referred to little other than remediation  of the site. Last year, Ministers told us that they would confound the sceptics  by the progress that they intended to make; I am not yet confounded &mdash; although  I would like to be &mdash; on the inability of the Executive to deliver anything  substantial on the Maze site. Will the Minister tell us what will be done  substantively rather than by remediation?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: I have been critical in interviews of the fact that we have not  moved more speedily to develop the Maze/Long Kesh site in the interest of our  people. I hope that over the course of the coming period, we can see progress  on that issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member referred to those who wish to see a shrine at  Long Kesh; I do not know anybody who has argued for a shrine at Long Kesh. I  have heard people from the unionist persuasion articulate a view that that is  what republicans want. Let me state here and now: that is not what republicans  want. Republicans want, alongside our unionist colleagues who have contributed  to the many visits and trips that we have been on &mdash; I have been to Sri Lanka,  the Basque country and Iraq, and many other people in this House have made  similar trips &mdash; a viable, meaningful centre that will contribute to world  peace, not a shrine to anybody. If anything, what will happen at the site will  be a shrine to peace building, not just here in the north of Ireland, but in  the world.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Investment Strategy for Northern Ireland</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr Brolly </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and the deputy First Minister to  detail how the rollout of the investment strategy for Northern Ireland  will provide opportunities for the local construction industry in the short  term.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO893/09>(AQO 893/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: The Executive&rsquo;s investment strategy will result in up to &pound;20  billion being invested by 2018 to tackle the legacy of decades of  underinvestment. Our investment strategy has special relevance to the  construction industry. The First Minister and I recognise the seriousness of  the situation facing the construction industry and are particularly concerned  about recent reports regarding future employment levels.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We recently had a valuable meeting with construction  industry representatives, who put their concerns and ideas to us directly. We  are considering them carefully with the Strategic Investment Board (SIB) and  will respond shortly. We believe that we have established a good basis for  further engagement with the industry. Our Department is working with  construction employers, SIB and other Departments to ensure that we do our  utmost to help the construction industry within the resources that are  available to the Administration.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Our construction industry stands to benefit significantly  from the 10-year investment strategy that has been agreed by the Executive. The  procurement of projects under the investment strategy will be taken forward in  full compliance with procurement rules, and there will be opportunities for our  local construction industry, either as a lead contractor or as part of the  supply chain.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive are determined to deliver the investment  strategy to the fullest extent possible. We must recognise that we are  constrained by the funding available to us; however, it should be remembered  that just over five years ago, infrastructure investment was less than &pound;1  billion per annum. Last year, it amounted to almost &pound;1&middot;4 billion, and it is  planned to reach &pound;2 billion per annum by the end of this Budget period. That is  a measure of the progress that we have made, and a signal of the Executive&rsquo;s  ambition to go further.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brolly</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Will the Minister detail the  arrangements that are in place to monitor the delivery of projects by  Departments?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: New arrangements are being implemented to monitor the timely  delivery of projects and programmes by Departments and agencies. A detailed  delivery-tracking system for the investment strategy is being rolled out across  Departments. Working closely with DFP and other Departments, the Strategic  Investment Board is leading the development and management of the system.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When fully operational, the delivery-tracking system will  enable the Executive to have a detailed performance-monitoring framework that  shows progress against the 23 sub-pillars in the strategy. In addition, the  construction industry will be able to access directly information about future  work that is in the pipeline to help with that sector&rsquo;s business planning.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Central Procurement Directorate will advise on the most  appropriate procurement strategies and work with the Strategic Investment Board  and Departments to implement suitable delivery arrangements and enhance the  delivery capacity of Departments and agencies.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burnside</strong>:  Does the deputy First Minister agree that although it is all very well having  an investment strategy for Northern    Ireland, the credit crisis has destroyed  investment opportunities for firms and there is no cash available in the  financial system? Will he provide evidence that he has made representations to  Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government, the Treasury and the National Economic Council, which  was established after the nationalisation of much of the British banking  system, to help companies to invest and to help small businesses to get  favourable credit facilities to allow them to escape the recession?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: The Department of Finance and Personnel and the Office of the  First Minister and deputy First Minister (OFMDFM) are involved in ongoing  discussions with the British Government. When we have the opportunity, we  discuss the economic situation in detail with the British Prime Minister. These  are difficult times, not just for our small economy but for many democracies  throughout the world that are suffering. I am sure that all Members, like  myself, are keen to see the outcome of the pending US presidential election, which  could have massive financial implications for the planet.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to recognise that there are huge challenges  before us. We have a limited ability to remedy the difficulties that exist.  There will be some &pound;6 billion available to us over the next three years and up  to &pound;20 billion available over the next 10 years &mdash; we must ensure that that  money is used to benefit our construction industry. This is not a time to be  defeatist or a time to throw the arms up &mdash; this is a time to knuckle down and  recognise that there is much that we can do, in spite of the great challenges  that exist.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. The Construction Employers Federation  recently suggested that some public-sector projects should be brought forward.  In light of the instability that has been created by the lack of Executive  meetings, will the deputy First Minister outline what has been done by the  Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister to effect that proposal?  Does he agree that doing nothing is not an option and that the stalemate  between the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in is an embarrassment?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: The Office of the First Minster and deputy First Minister and the  Strategic Investment Board are working closely with DFP to ensure that the  available capital resources are deployed as effectively as possible. We met all  the different interest groups in society that are experiencing pressure, so we  are aware of the need to ensure that the Executive take decisions that will  benefit those people.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We are not powerless, and it is wrong to say that nothing  is being done. I agree that there is a difficulty, which must be overcome, and  I hope that that happens in the not too distant future. As we proceed, we must  recognise that although there are huge challenges before us, we have resources  available that we can use to benefit the construction industry.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is unacceptable to all Members that people, particularly  construction workers and employers, go through such difficulties at present.  Therefore, it is our duty and responsibility to explore every prospect, idea and  suggestion that we receive &mdash; several of which have been received in recent  weeks. We will advance that work through discussions with the Strategic  Investment Board and different interest groups in a manner that will, I hope,  allow us to meet the challenges that clearly lie before us.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Cohesion, Sharing and Integration</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Mrs Long </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister what  assessment it has given of the role of central Government in delivering  cohesion, sharing and integration.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO872/09>(AQO  872/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: At the outset, I apologise to members of the Committee for the  Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister, and to other Members,  that the First Minister and I have been unable to honour our commitment to  provide the draft programme for cohesion, sharing and integration to the  Committee before the Halloween recess.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Having said that, I must make several points. First, the  delay should not be taken as an indication that we do not regard building a  shared and better future for all our people to be a top priority. Indeed, it is  because we consider it so important that we want to take a little longer to  tighten and clarify our proposals.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, I remind Members that we do not work in a  good-relations vacuum while the refreshed policy proposals are finalised. The  work to challenge sectarianism, racism and all forms of intolerance continues  to great effect &mdash; with the active support of my colleagues, I must add. Last  year, we spent &pound;6 million to support good-relations work throughout all 26  council areas. This year, we will have spent &pound;8 million, which includes &pound;1  million that was specifically directed to support minority-ethnic groups, as  well as many vital initiatives to tackle sectarianism and racism.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although many issues must be dealt with, my Department&rsquo;s  recently published good-relations indicators confirm many positive trends that  reflect tangible improvements in the nature of society. OFMDFM&rsquo;s role in the  cross-cutting good-relations policy is central, pivotal and directional. We  will ensure that the programme for cohesion, sharing and integration  contributes to our overarching policy to achieve a peaceful, fair and  prosperous society, in which there is respect for the rule of law, thereby ensuring  a shared and better future for all our people.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Our work demonstrates our commitment to build cohesive,  inclusive communities. The fact that we have already begun to deliver the  additional funding that was secured in the Executive&rsquo;s Budget means that vital work  on the ground and with new communities is better resourced than in recent  years. Obviously, 2008&rsquo;s peaceful summer is attributable to the dedication of  youth workers and interface workers. Our role is to ensure that their efforts  are recognised, resourced and supported.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, some Member will surely ask when the policy will  be provided to the Committee and the Assembly. We have made the matter a top  priority. We will clarify timescales with the Committee as soon as possible.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>:  When I tabled the question, I hoped, rather than expected, that the Committee  would have the document by now. I understand what the deputy First Minister  said, but how perfect does the consultation document need to be at this stage?  Given that feedback will be received from different groups during lengthy  consultation, must the document be gilded before it is issued? Is it not wiser  to present the Committee with the document in its current state so that the  consultation process can proceed? That appears to belie a complete lack of  urgency on the matter.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: I want to dispel the notion that there is a lack of urgency on  the issue. We recognise the importance of introducing the plan for cohesion,  sharing and integration. A little more time is required. I am sure that, when  it is eventually handed over, Members will recognise that it was worth the  wait.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I share other Members&rsquo; frustration about the strategy&rsquo;s delay. Can the deputy  First Minister confirm whether the delay is in any way connected to his party&rsquo;s  blockade of Executive meetings? Irrespective of that, when will he and his  party catch themselves on and start to work for the people of Northern Ireland?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: The Members on this side of the House work extremely hard for all  the people of the North of Ireland. The criticism that was levelled at the  delay in publishing the report is justified, but that has nothing to do with  the present situation between Sinn F&eacute;in and its partners in Government. We must  expedite the publication of the report, and we firmly intend that it will be  published sooner rather than later.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  Does the deputy First Minister agree that sectarianism remains the biggest  problem in, and divider of, communities in Northern Ireland? Will he identify  to the Assembly the Government&rsquo;s role in promoting reconciliation and tackling  sectarianism?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: Sectarianism and racism are terrible evils in our society.  Members&rsquo; experience over the past few years of coming together in the Assembly  and embarking on a new course &mdash; albeit one of uncharted waters for many &mdash;  clearly suggests to the vast majority of people that times have changed.  However, the Assembly cannot eradicate sectarianism or racism overnight; it  will be a process that requires people to lead by example. Members&rsquo; role is to  provide political leadership through the Assembly. Community leaders also have  a huge responsibility to set an example, and that is happening. The extremely hard  work by many people in the youth and community sectors continues to complement  Members&rsquo; efforts.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As we move forward, it is important to recognise that there  is a process involved. Sectarian bigots and racists exist, and the Assembly&rsquo;s  job is to cut the space available to them through leading by example. We must  take the necessary decisions to ensure support and funding for those who work  at the coalface to defeat those twin evils.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Strategy for Children and Young People</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Ms S  Ramsey </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister how  it will ensure Departments deliver against targets set out in the strategy for  children and young people. <a name=AQO901/09>(AQO 901/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: The junior Ministers are responsible for the co-ordination of  policy that impacts on the lives of children and young people, and they are  driving forward the 10-year strategy. OFMDFM is developing a three-year  cross-departmental action plan in order to contribute to the delivery of that  strategy. The action plan is for a specific period of three years and reflects  the priorities in the Programme for Government and associated public service  agreements. It will include input from all Departments, the NIO and the Court  Service.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">OFMDFM will send to ministerial colleagues the conclusions  of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the Department  will ask them to consider any further specific recommendations for inclusion in  the action plan. The junior Ministers established and chair the strategy  planning and review group (SPRG), whose role is to advise on, and monitor the  implementation of, the strategy&rsquo;s action plans. Recently, the group received  draft copies of the three-year action plan. Ministers will consult with SPRG  and give due regard to its views.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Key Departments are represented on SPRG, and it will submit  review reports to the ministerial subcommittee on children and young people,  which is also chaired by the junior Ministers. That provides a platform for  highlighting progress at ministerial level. OFMDFM intends to publish biannual  progress reports that will identify any targets that individual Departments are  unlikely to meet. In addition, each Department has nominated a champion for  children and young people in order to promote their interests and to ensure  that their views on policy and strategy are sought.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. I thank the deputy First Minister for his answer. I  appreciate that individual Ministers and the junior Ministers are working hard  in order to ensure the implementation of the 10-year strategy for children and  young people. I am interested in the three-year action plan, and if the deputy  First Minister would highlight some of its specifics to give Members a feel for  the current state of play, I would appreciate that.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: The action plan seeks to highlight the key pieces of work that  will make the largest contribution to the delivery of improved outcomes. It  recognises new and targeted actions, as well as the ongoing work that continues  to have a positive impact on the lives of children and young people.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It has been developed to include three main elements in  each outcome area. Key pieces of ongoing work have been successful and continue  to benefit children and young people. Furthermore, key pieces of work have been  amended to extend current provision, build on achievements or address areas in  which the desired impact was not being achieved. During the three-year period,  new actions have been implemented to improve outcomes for all children and  young people. The draft action plan is being discussed by the strategy planning  and review groups, the views of which will be used to develop a revised draft.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  Although I appreciate the deputy First Minister&rsquo;s response, elected  representatives and the Committee for the Office of the First Minister and  deputy First Minister are frustrated by the lacklustre approach to delivering  the Committee&rsquo;s 47 recommendations.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister agree that it is imperative that all Departments  &mdash; such as the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure, the Department of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety, the Department of Finance and  Personnel, the Department for Employment and Learning and, in particular, the  Department of Education &mdash; deliver a strategy urgently in order to address child  poverty directly and not tinker around the edges?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: I am disappointed that the Member considers our approach  lacklustre. I disagree with that analysis; much good work has been done, and  the process has now reached the action stage, whereby cross-departmental work  is under way to ensure delivery for young people. It is critical that the  process advance speedily, and I am satisfied that the junior Ministers, who  have been charged with that responsibility, are acutely aware of the need to  progress that matter as quickly as possible.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  The deputy First Minister mentioned action plans. However, in my constituency  of Strangford, 6,300 children live in poverty. In light of the economic  downturn, will the deputy First Minister outline whether Executive targets for  eradicating child poverty are realisable?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: All Members recognise that such figures are unacceptable, and  other Members could cite similar figures from their constituencies. Those  figures highlight the extent of the problem and the Assembly&rsquo;s responsibility  to reduce child poverty dramatically. The Programme for Government outlines our  targets. The worldwide economic situation affects all Governments, not least  the Assembly. However, Members should be confident that we can reduce those  unacceptably high figures, not only in Mr McNarry&rsquo;s constituency but in others.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Integrated Development Fund</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Ms N&iacute;  Chuil&iacute;n </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and the deputy First  Minister how it intends to build on the work of the Integrated Development Fund  to redress poverty and inequality. <a name=AQO892/09>(AQO  892/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">8. <strong>Ms  Anderson </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and the deputy First  Minister to provide an update on the projects currently under way, or agreed,  that will be funded by the integrated development fund in Derry/Londonderry and  in north and west Belfast. <a name=AQO907/09>(AQO 907/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I will answer questions  5 and 8 together. The integrated development fund (IDF) was established in 2003  as a pilot scheme to promote greater local partnership in a range of sectors,  including selected areas of Departments. To date, eight north-west IDF projects  and 15 projects from west Belfast/Greater  Shankill have been formally approved. The total cost of those projects is  almost &pound;92 million, and IDF support totalling almost &pound;29 million has been made  available to bring them to a conclusion.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, seven projects from the north-west and three  from west Belfast/Greater  Shankill have, in principle, received approval but have yet to be submitted for  full approval. The estimated cost of those projects is almost &pound;46 million, with  an IDF element totalling more than &pound;19 million. The Department is happy to  provide details of individual projects on request, and it is considering  correspondence from the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment on the  future of the west Belfast  and Greater Shankill task force initiative.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We remain committed to addressing poverty and inequality  for all our people. The Executive will shortly consider proposals for the  adoption of Lifetime Opportunities, which is an overall strategy for tackling  poverty, social exclusion and patterns of deprivation based on objective need.  Those proposals include the establishment of an Executive subcommittee to  identify priorities and develop a cross-departmental action plan to address  poverty and social exclusion. The work of that subcommittee is expected to  include consideration of how existing and developing cross-cutting strategies  can contribute to better equality of opportunity and realisation of the poverty  targets contained in the Programme for Government.</p>

	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Local Government Boundaries Commissioner</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mr  Kennedy </strong>asked the Minister of the Environment what is his assessment of the  recommendations made by the Local Government Boundaries Commissioner in his  Provisional Recommendations Report.&nbsp; (AQO  835/09)</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">13. <strong>Mr K  Robinson </strong>asked the Minister of the Environment for his assessment of the  consideration given by the Local Government Boundaries Commissioner to the  identity of local communities in his Review of Northern Ireland Government  Boundaries Provisional Recommendations Report.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO844/09>(AQO  844/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment (Mr S Wilson)</strong>: With your permission, Mr Speaker, I will  answer questions 1 and 13 together.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Local Government Boundaries Commissioner has been  tasked with providing recommendations for the names and boundaries of the 11 new  local government districts referred to in the Local Government (Boundaries)  (Northern Ireland) Act 2008 and for the number, names and boundaries of the  wards that will compose them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Commissioner&rsquo;s provisional recommendations form an  important part of the process of consultation on the new boundaries. That will  include public hearings, which the commissioner has arranged in each of the 11  proposed local council districts and which will provide an opportunity for oral  representation. The hearings are scheduled to take place between 20 and 28  November. If individuals, communities or their representatives wish to comment  on the provisional recommendations, in relation to local identities or any  other matter, they have an opportunity to make representations to the Commissioner,  either at the public hearings or in writing.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The commissioner is independent of central Government, so  it is not for me or my Department to make an assessment of the provisional  recommendations or any aspect of those recommendations. I will read the final  report with great interest, but it would be inappropriate for me to comment at  this stage.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I am grateful to the Minister for his reply. Does he not accept that, since  they rejected amendments to the legislation that would have given the Local  Government Boundaries Commissioner greater flexibility to expand natural  boundaries, DUP Ministers have effectively increased the likelihood of Belfast turning green,  which might prevent future civic events such as yesterday&rsquo;s wonderful occasion  when we welcomed home our troops?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I am at a loss to understand where the Member comes from  on this issue. The commissioner has the ability to absorb large areas into new  district council areas. There is, therefore, ample room for moving boundaries.  If the Member doubts his party&rsquo;s ability to make effective representations to  the Commissioner, he should not point the finger at me or my Department or my  predecessor, but should consider instead the inadequacy of his party&rsquo;s  resources. If he wants to make representations to the Commissioner along that  lines that Belfast  should remain a balanced council, there is ample opportunity for him to do so, and  for the Commissioner to act on those representations &mdash; within the existing  legislation and the regulations laid down by my predecessor.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Will the Minister give any indication  as to the remit of the District Electoral Area Commissioner? What are the  minimum and maximum numbers of wards to be contained in each district electoral  area to ensure transparency and equality?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The Local Government Boundaries Commissioner has been  tasked with making representations on the boundaries of the 11 new local  government districts. In doing so, he can consider how many wards will be in  each. The legislation provides that 60 wards may be included in Belfast and 40 in each of  the other districts, but the commissioner may allow a degree of variation, that  is, up to five wards either way.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is for parties to make representations to the  commissioner to ensure that boundaries are fair and that they allow local  councils to reflect the make-up of those areas. As I said to the Member for  Newry and Armagh, the effectiveness of those  representations will depend on the ability of parties to get their act together  and make known their views.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There will be an opportunity for that after the  Commissioner submits his report. I will study his report initially, but it must  be endorsed by the Assembly. Therefore, if people feel that the Commissioner  has not done his job adequately &mdash; or they feel that there are serious flaws in  his recommendations &mdash; there will be opportunities in the Assembly to make  changes.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his responses thus far. Although some Members seem to  have thrown in the towel as regards Belfast,  it is clear that there are others who will continue to focus on that issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I ask the Minister &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Member has the Floor.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: Is  the Minister confident that the timescales he set will be met by the  Commissioner who has been appointed?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I expected the fireworks to come later in this period of  Question Time, but it appears that the Members to my right are excited about  this issue: perhaps it is because they feel that they are not able to represent  the people who voted for them.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I assure the Member who asked the question that the  Commissioner has the tools to ensure that the populations within the boundaries  are fairly represented and reflected and to allow parties to make effective  representations.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Commissioner is on target to complete the review on  time. Consultation on the provisional recommendations has finished; the  deadline for written representations is 12 November 2008, and oral hearings  will take place from 20 to 28 November. The assistant commissioners will be in  place before the end of the week. I have made it quite clear to the  Commissioner that I expect his final report by 30 June 2009.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">International Banking Crisis</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr  Simpson </strong>asked the Minister of the Environment for his assessment of the  financial losses accrued by local councils as a result of the international  banking crisis.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO863/09>(AQO 863/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: None of the 26 district councils has incurred a financial  loss as a result of the international banking crisis.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Simpson</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer. Local councils face twin financial issues  &mdash; they must deal with the implications of the review of local government and  the move to 11 councils, and they must cope with the current financial  downturn.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister detail the criteria for investment funds?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The criteria are set out in the Trustee Act (Northern Ireland)  2001. Councils are required to carry out numerous tasks. From time to time,  trustees must review the investments of the trusts and &mdash; while having regard to  the standard investment criteria &mdash; should consider whether those should be  varied.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The standard investment criteria relate to the suitability  of trust investments of the same kind. They also relate to the need to ensure  that investments are diversified, so that councils do not have all of their  eggs in one basket. If that were the case, and a financial crisis occurred &mdash;  such as the one that affected organisations with funds in Icelandic banks &mdash;  councils would be exposed to risks.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The criteria require councils to review their investments  and make sure that they do not have all of their eggs in one basket. Councils  are also required to ensure that their spread of investments meet the standards  that are required of investment trusts.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  am pleased that local councils have not suffered financial losses, but the  Minister will be aware that local councils currently have significant debts. How  will he ensure that the ratepayers in Larne and Carrickfergus, for instance,  will not have to pick up the &pound;34 million of debt that exists in Ballymena Borough  Council after it built lavish new council offices?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The debt that has been incurred by district councils prior  to the reorganisation of councils will be absorbed within the new council  boundaries. There will be a larger rate base within those boundaries.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Some of the new councils may incur debts; however, they  should also have assets from which ratepayers will benefit. Where there is a  transfer of some areas from one council to another under the review of public  administration, it will be up to the transition committees to ensure that the  transfer of assets is reflected clearly in the transfer of debt. That is how  inequalities will be dealt with.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  Do any of the Department of the Environment&rsquo;s agencies hold funds in any of the  Icelandic banks that have got into difficulties?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The only groups that were likely to hold such funds are  the councils and, as I made clear in an earlier answer, none of the councils  holds funds in Icelandic banks. Nor do councils hold assets with banks that are  not covered by the guarantees that have been given by the UK Government or by  the Government in the Republic.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Bryson House</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Mr Ross </strong>asked  the Minister of the Environment for his assessment of the contribution of  Bryson House to the waste management strategy.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO842/09>(AQO  842/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I acknowledge fully the valuable contribution made by  Bryson House to achieving the objectives of the Northern Ireland waste management  strategy. Recently, I visited the Bryson House facility and saw the excellent  work that is being done there. Recycling and recovery are an important part of  the progressive transition towards better resource management. I have no doubt  that Bryson&rsquo;s kerbside box-collection scheme &mdash; which started in my council area  in 1999 &mdash; has contributed to the material-recycling facility and to the  increase in recycling from 4&middot;9% in 1999 to 27&middot;7% in 2006-07.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The success of the strategy largely depends upon changing  attitudes and behaviour. Therefore, I welcome initiatives such as the  innovative Bryson House schools-education programme Sort It Out, which has  raised awareness and encourages best practice and behavioural change.  Programmes such as that will help us to achieve our main aim &mdash; a cultural shift  towards better resource management and improved environmental quality. That  programme is a good example of how to deliver key messages concerning waste to  our young people.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his answer. The Minister will know that waste management  is an important issue &mdash; indeed, there was a conference in the Long Gallery  earlier today about it. Does the Minister intend to continue funding Bryson  House after 31 March 2009?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: My officials are considering the future of the community  waste innovation fund, through which Bryson House is funded. That is part of  the implementation of the waste management strategy. However, there are no firm  plans to extend the fund beyond March 2009, simply because the Department has  not yet received the evaluation of it. The fund involves a considerable amount  of money, so it would be wrong to proceed without a proper evaluation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must examine the evaluation before I can consider  whether there should be a successor to the community waste innovation fund.  However, as I said in the Long Gallery today, we want to improve the  communications strategy by putting resources into it; given the kind of work  that Bryson House is undertaking, I have no doubt that it will be in a position  to bid for some of that work.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  What discussion has the Minister&rsquo;s Department had with the Department of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment to develop opportunities for other  social-economy enterprises to contribute to the waste management strategy?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Bryson House is the major social enterprise that is  implementing the waste management strategy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to encourage social enterprise, and that is an area  in which it can do a good job. Bryson House has used some of its profits from  recycling to reinvest in socially worthwhile programmes throughout Northern Ireland,  including schemes to make areas safer. That is the way forward.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although I have not had any discussions with the Minister  of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, when I visited Bryson House a couple of  weeks ago, I spoke to its representatives about the importance of social  enterprise and how it can result in money being ploughed back into local areas.  That is a good model, which I hope we can develop.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: My  question is similar to the previous one. What action has the Minister taken to  encourage local job creation by growing recycling businesses?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, concerning the link between the Department of  the Environment and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, rather  than having just one social-economy business, Bryson House, does the Minister  envisage any potential for further developing the social economy?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: There are opportunities for organisations that seek niche  markets. However, although recycling rates must increase, there is a limit to  how effective it can be. I am sure that Bryson House and other recyclers will  have suffered owing to the vagaries of the market. Over the past week many  recyclable materials &mdash; such as glass, paper, woodchip &mdash; have had a nil value.  Consequently, we must be careful not to put all our eggs into one basket, and  we must not overemphasise the potential of such enterprises. Nevertheless,  given the fact that niche schemes have an impact on local communities, social  enterprises should undertake such schemes because they are the only enterprises  that are likely to plough profits back into those communities.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Irish Hare: Protection</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mr Wells </strong>asked the Minister of the Environment for his assessment of the level of  protection given to the Irish hare in Northern   Ireland, in comparison to that afforded to the species in  the Republic of Ireland.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO817/09>(AQO  817/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>:In Northern    Ireland, the Irish hare is a quarry species,  the hunting of which is regulated under extant game laws, and they are  protected in the close season. In addition, from 2004, the Irish hare has been  protected by annual special protection orders, which prevent the taking, sale  and killing of the species. Such protection is in contrast to that provided in  the Irish Republic by the Green Party&rsquo;s Minister  for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, who has refused to protect  the Irish hare. By introducing a special protection order this year, I have  protected the Irish hare, and I understand that several hares have already  sought asylum on this side of the border. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There has been some opposition to that from obvious  sources, and the Equality Commission is reviewing my actions to ensure that I  am not convening any race or colour legislation by protecting the English brown  hare. However, I assure the Member that, despite my reputation, I am greener on  this matter than the Minister in the Irish   Republic.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>: I  welcome the Minister&rsquo;s assurance that the Irish hare will continue to be protected,  and it is ironic that the Green Party&rsquo;s Minister in the Irish Republic  has failed to do the same. Will the Minister embarrass the Irish Minister even  further by announcing permanent protection for the Irish hare in Northern Ireland?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Let me make it clear to the Member: the special protection  order is being renewed year on year, and the objective is to increase the  density of hares in Northern    Ireland to one hare per square kilometre by  2010.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Such Orders are renewed annually in order to ascertain  their effect. If we find that they help us to achieve our target, there is an  opportunity to make permanent legislation on the matter.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Between now and 2010, it is important that we look  carefully at the impact of the Order year to year to see whether we are  achieving our goals.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  What co-operation has there been between the North and the South on the  protection of the Irish hare? The Minister can let the hare out of the bag. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Having done my bit during Question Time for cross-border  relations and for relations with the Green Party&rsquo;s Minister for the  Environment, Heritage and Local Government in the Republic, I can say that  co-operation between Northern Ireland  and the Irish Republic exists on the issue. However, I  accept that they are slightly behind us, and we have to drag them along a  little. An all-Ireland species-action plan was published jointly by the former  Environment and Heritage Service and the National Parks and Wildlife Service in  November 2005. That plan identified several actions that were aimed at  promoting increases in the respective populations.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  have no doubt that the Minister enjoyed the opportunity to blow his trumpet &mdash;  or, in fact, the trumpet of the Assembly in its first guise &mdash; for the  protection that is afforded to the Irish hare in Northern Ireland. Furthermore, I  acknowledge that his party colleagues &mdash; with the exception of Mr Shannon &mdash;  voted in favour of my amendment to the legislation at that time, which enhanced  that protection. However, the legislation lacks protection for hares that are  being imported illegally across the border. In view of the Minister&rsquo;s concern  for cross-border relations, I thought that he would take action on those illegal  importations.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In response to a question for written answer, the Minister  informed me that it costs &pound;30,000 every year to implement the temporary Special  Protection Order. Why will he not do the decent thing on environmental, welfare  and financial grounds and introduce permanent protection?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The Member ought to read more carefully the answers that I  give him. Had he done so, he would have seen that the &pound;30,000 costs are not for  the implementation of the temporary Special Protection Order; that money is  spent on monitoring whether the protection is leading to an increase in the  hare population in Northern    Ireland. Even if a permanent Special  Protection Order were in place, the &pound;30,000 would be spent on monitoring its  effectiveness. To suggest that putting a permanent Special Protection Order in  place would save &pound;30,000 shows either that the Member has difficulty in  understanding my answers to him or that he is trying to use my answer in a way  that was not intended.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Climate Change Bill</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mr  Dallat </strong>asked the Minister of the Environment to outline his Department&rsquo;s  position in relation to the Climate Change Bill.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO888/09>(AQO 888/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I would have been disappointed had I not been asked a  question on climate change. I think that some Member has managed to ask such a  question in every Question Time so far &mdash; albeit the Members are becoming less  inventive. It appears that the system has ensured that those questions are near  the top of the list, and I am happy for that to be the case.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department continues to provide relevant input to the  passage of the Climate Change Bill at Westminster.  It agrees arrangements with Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (DEFRA) on funding arrangements for the Committee on Climate Change, and it  provides an input to the implementation of the Bill. Members will be pleased to  hear that in the two most recent communications that I had with the DEFRA  Minister Hilary Benn on the implementation of the legislation on climate  change, I made it clear to him that the proposed measures on carbon trading and  carbon reduction &mdash; which would lead to a 45% increase in electricity bills &mdash;  were unacceptable. I believe that my comments reflect the views of all Members  on that matter.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Additionally, the Department is taking forward discussions  on governance arrangements in respect of the Climate Change Bill.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>: I  have listened carefully to the Minister. I am pleased that he has dispelled the  rumours that he has been awarded an honorary degree from the Bart Simpson  school of environmental science.<span class="Italic"> [Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Last week, the Minister took part in a debate at Westminster, where he  acted with the Noes. Does he believe that Northern Ireland has any reasonable  chance of representation in respect of the Climate Change Bill, bearing in mind  the scandalous way in which he behaved?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: It is appropriate during questions to the Environment  Minister that the Member should recycle some of his jokes. They do not get any  better. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Climate Change Bill has passed through the House of  Commons, and will go to the House of Lords. If it passes through the House of  Lords unchanged, there will be targets for 80% reductions in CO2 emissions by  2050, by which time, of course, none of us will be around to take account of  whether that target was achieved.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As I look around the Chamber, I am surrounded by Members  who have taken the same view on this subject as I have &mdash; namely that an 80%  target, resulting in a reduction of CO2 emissions to 1990 levels by 2050, is  not possible.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Every measure that the Government suggested we need to take  to achieve those levels has been rejected by all parties in the Assembly. One  of the principal measures was to increase the price of fuel, including petrol,  and all parties in the Assembly have rejected that suggestion. Another major  measure was to reduce carbon emissions from power stations, which &mdash; according  to the Government&rsquo;s admission in letters to me &mdash; would increase the price of  electricity by 45%. All Members have rejected that suggestion on the grounds of  fuel poverty. Another measure was to increase the tax on cars with high carbon  emissions, which Members have also rejected because many people in Northern Ireland  own cars that are more than seven years old.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The only measure to receive widespread endorsement by  Members is the insulation of homes, which, according to the Budget paper, will  have a minimal impact on carbon emissions. All Members have doubts about the Climate  Change Bill.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Butler</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Does the Minister agree with setting  annual targets for emission reductions, as provided for in the Scottish Climate  Change Bill?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: No, I do not. One must look at the influences on carbon  emissions. For example, a bout of very bad winter weather that would cause  people to use more home heating oil and electricity &mdash; which are both major  sources of emissions &mdash; would mean that the target could be missed completely.  The output of carbon depends, among other matters, on the weather and economic  activity, and the current downturn may well lead to a reduction in carbon  emissions this year. However, the economy may grow next year, and that could  lead to another increase. It is nonsensical to set year-on-year targets because  they are fairly pointless, bearing in mind that so many factors can influence  them.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McClarty</strong>:  Last week, in another place, the Minister spoke against the Climate Change  Bill, and he was one of only five out of 645 MPs to vote against an amendment  that will require improvements in energy efficiency. Given that five of his  colleagues voted in favour of the Bill, is he now not only at odds with his  Department, but with his own divided party?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The Members on the Benches to my right know all about  divided parties &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Answer the question.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: That party has more divisions than there have been in the  House of Commons over the Climate Change Bill. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member has described the Climate Change Bill as a Bill  that promotes energy efficiency. The Bill, as passed through the House of  Commons, requires draconian cuts in carbon emissions. According to the Government&rsquo;s  Budget 2007, those cuts can be achieved only by increasing fuel and energy  prices, cutting farm outputs and introducing a range of other measures,  including a 20% target for biofuels. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Many people have said that such a target is unrealistic.  All I say to the Member is that if he can produce for the Assembly ideas and  recommendations on how to achieve that target without hurting constituents, and  hurting them badly, I will support his recommendations. If he cannot, I will  not.</p>

	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Green Rebate</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mr  McGlone </strong>asked the Minister of Finance and Personnel if he will give a  commitment in principle to provide a &ldquo;green rebate&rdquo; on rates to encourage  greater use of renewable technologies.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO926/09>(AQO  926/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel (Mr Dodds)</strong>: The Executive decided to proceed with two  proposals on the matter. One offered rates rebates to owner-occupiers to bring  their houses up to modern insulation standards, and the other offered initial  rates exemption to the first residents of new homes that are assessed as being  zero-carbon-rated. The consultation on the details of those policies ended on  26 September, and departmental officials briefed the Committee for Finance and  Personnel on the outcome of the process on 8 October. I am considering the  consultation outcome and the Committee&rsquo;s views, and I will then take a decision  on a way forward. I will announce the scheme&rsquo;s final shape shortly. The details  will also be published as part of the consultation report on all remaining  rating policies.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I can now say that the rates rebate is for insulation work  to houses. That measure is likely to make the biggest value-for-money  difference to the energy efficiency of our housing stock. If the scheme proves  to be successful, it may be worthwhile extending it to include renewable  technologies.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Given that grants for renewables were withdrawn earlier this year, can the  Minister expand on other measures that can be offered to encourage the use of  renewable energy in domestic properties?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The Member refers to a previous decision on a scheme  under direct rule that was time-limited, and that came to a natural end. The  impact of that scheme is being reviewed. I want to make that clear.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Extending the proposed energy-efficiency rates-rebate  scheme to include other measures would take more time than may be available to  us. However, I will consider those issues, and I will not rule out a second  phase of the scheme. The key is to ensure that the measures that would have the  most immediate benefit &mdash; for example, insulation &mdash; be introduced first. That is  an issue with which we will press ahead at the earliest opportunity.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Has the Minister authorised a review  of cost benefits to the regional economy of renewable energy, in the light of  the rising cost of fossil fuels?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: That matter falls within the remit of the Department  of Enterprise, Trade and Investment; if the Member wishes to pursue it, he  should do so with that Department, either through tabling a motion for debate  or through tabling questions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is an important issue. There is no doubt that decisions  taken on such issues will have far-reaching consequences, not only for energy  provision but for expenditure. Let us say, for example, that we decide to go  down the road of increased electricity generation from wind power, which would  provide the most readily accessible form of renewable energy. In that case,  infrastructure work would have to be carried out to the grid, and that would  require substantial investment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Time and again at this lectern, I have been at pains to  emphasise that investment decisions &mdash; on issues such as renewable energy &mdash; must  be informed by an assessment of where the money will not be spent as a result  of the investment. Those are big decisions on key issues, and they must be  discussed thoroughly by the Assembly, the relevant Committees and the  Executive.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: Has  the Minister given any consideration to reducing or removing the fees for  building control applications? Such a measure may encourage the use of  small-scale renewables.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I acknowledge the Member&rsquo;s comments. The nature of  the business is that there are costs incurred that have to be recovered. The  Member&rsquo;s proposal to cut the costs incurred by people making building control  applications may be desirable. However, once again, I emphasise that that  expenditure would have to be recovered from somewhere else. All the issues cost  the Executive and the Assembly money. Therefore, all matters must be considered  in the round as to where the money will come from. I assure the Member that his  suggestion will be given consideration.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Lone Pensioner Allowance Scheme</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr  Shannon </strong>asked the Minister of Finance and Personnel when payments will be  made under the lone pensioner allowance scheme.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO834/09>(AQO  834/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Land and Property Services began to issue refunds  following awards of lone pensioner allowances in July 2008. To date, some  16,078 refunds have been made to ratepayers. The Northern Ireland Housing  Executive, which manages lone pensioner allowance applications from ratepayers  who rent property, also began to make awards in July 2008. The Housing  Executive has made 2,103 credit adjustments to tenants&rsquo; housing accounts. Land  and Property Services is working to process the remaining 1,082 applications.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his response. Applicants for lone pensioner allowances  become annoyed because of delays in payments being sent out. I am aware that  looking after pensioners is a matter that is very close to the Minister&rsquo;s  heart. Other than the lone pensioner allowance scheme, what initiatives is the  Minister considering in order to help pensioners?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I thank the Member for his question. I share his  frustration about people having to wait unreasonable lengths of time to receive  payments. As I said, 1,082 applications still have to be processed, and I hope  that those will be processed very soon. Almost &pound;2&middot;5 million has been awarded  under the lone pensioner allowance scheme; a substantial amount of money has  gone back into the pockets of pensioners who live alone.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We have implemented a number of measures to help  pensioners, such as the increase from &pound;16,000 to &pound;50,000 in the savings limit  that is applicable to pensioners under the low-income rates-relief scheme. Consultation  on a rates deferment scheme for pensioners who are homeowners is nearing  completion, and I propose to make an announcement on that shortly. Furthermore,  the decision to freeze regional rates benefits all households in Northern Ireland,  including pensioners.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We have announced proposals on data sharing, which would  facilitate an increased uptake of benefits and rates relief for pensioners.  Much emphasis is placed on cases of money going to the wrong people. However,  many people &mdash; particularly pensioners &mdash; do not claim the benefits to which they  are entitled. The data-sharing measure that we announced last week will go a  long way to improving pensioners&rsquo; uptake of relief schemes. I am sure that that  will be welcomed throughout the community. We are also working on a fuel  poverty action plan that would benefit pensioners.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I am grateful to the Minister for his response, and I will focus on the latter  part of his reply. What steps have been taken to use Government databases to  reach people who are not claiming lone pensioner allowances to which they are  entitled and thus increase the uptake of that important benefit?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: As I have said, proposals were recently announced to  increase co-operation and the sharing of information and data between agencies  that hold that information. There is a long way to go before any Department or  agency will achieve automatic allocation of reliefs; however, progress is being  made. The proposals that I outlined will go a long way to improving the  position, particularly for pensioners.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have met people in my constituency &mdash; as I am sure Mr  Kennedy has in his &mdash; who come to discuss one issue only for it to emerge that  they may be eligible for several reliefs and benefits. It is important that  Government do more to ensure that people receive their full entitlements.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  The Minister has allayed some of my concerns. However, will he assure me that  there will be an assessment to guarantee that the application form for the lone  pensioner allowance is user-friendly and that it is continuously improved to  ensure that it is easily accessible to pensioners?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I assure the honourable Member that everything will  be done to keep the form as simple and as accessible as possible. I understand  from constituents and others who have been involved in the matter that the form  is relatively straightforward, which is among the reasons why the allowance has  become so popular &mdash; it is straightforward, it is clear and it is not  means-tested.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, in that sense, it is straightforward and lessons  may be drawn from it for other initiatives and projects in which the Department  is engaged. I hope that any lone pensioners who have not availed themselves of  the scheme will hear about it and do so quickly.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Question 3 has been withdrawn.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Prospective Homebuyers</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mr Burns </strong>asked the Minister of Finance and Personnel what discussions he has had  with banks and building societies on their ability to lend money to prospective  homebuyers.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO870/09>(AQO 870/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Finance  and Personnel</strong>: The regulation of banks and building societies is a reserved  matter for the Treasury and the Financial Services Authority. Members must note  that the package of financial assistance announced by the Prime Minister on 13  October was specifically aimed at releasing liquidity in the banking sector and  at stimulating activity to prospective homebuyers and to borrowers. I have not  had direct representations from the local banking sector; however, my officials  closely monitor the effect of the financial situation on the local banking  sector.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Over recent weeks, I have had several meetings with key  stakeholders such as the Institute   of Directors and various  chambers of commerce. I reassured them that the actions of the Executive will  alleviate some difficulties; in particular, the Budget commitment to spend &pound;5&middot;5  billion on capital projects over the next three years will provide a  considerable stimulus to the local economy.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burns</strong>: Is  the Minister aware that certain banks require a 25% deposit before they offer a  mortgage? Has the Minister made any attempt to have those banks reduce that  figure?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: As I said, the regulation of banks is a reserved  matter; it is not a matter for the Executive or the Assembly. Therefore, it is  not appropriate for me to engage with banks on such issues.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Ultimately, banks are commercial operations and many offer  more generous rates than that, and banks that insist on a 25% deposit will  probably do much less business. Many in the construction industry, in the  house-building sector and people who want to get on the property ladder have  stressed the importance of banks and financial institutions recognising that  they must act responsibly in the current climate. The financial situation is  essentially a matter of confidence; it is about banks being prepared to lend to  one another, and to businesses and individuals, at a sensible rate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Everyone hopes that confidence will be restored. Some of  the measures that have been taken, which are designed to restore liquidity in  the banking sector, will work. I believe that progress is being made on that  front.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>:  What is the Minister&rsquo;s view on the impact that the continuing fall in the  property market is having? What support is available for people who are  experiencing financial hardship?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I am aware of the major downturn in the property  market, and it is one of the reasons why I announced, at the end of last week,  the suspension of the Workplace 2010 procurement exercise. I am aware of the  downturn not only in the public sector, but in the private sector. That  downturn is having an effect on many households. The Chancellor announced  recently a range of incentives to assist people across the United Kingdom  who are experiencing hardship. Those incentives include the extended  mortgage-relief scheme and enhanced cold weather payments, both of which will  apply in Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive have established a ministerial subgroup, involving  the Minister for Social Development, the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment and the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, to  consider what can be done for people who are affected by fuel poverty. Issues  such as the viability of a fuel-credit scheme and a targeted mortgage-rescue  scheme will also form part of those deliberations.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Robert  Coulter</strong>: I congratulate the Minister on the excellence of his answer. Will  he take steps to assess the total acreage that is available in Northern Ireland  for housing development on and off flood plains? By setting that within figures  for the level of demand for homes, will he establish a reasonable base price by  area for the site element of housing? In that way, some confidence can be built  that the house-price level has bottomed out or is close to bottoming out, given  that that is the key factor in inter-bank lending and in home-loan provision.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The Member raised a pertinent point about our current  financial situation and about inter-bank lending, which is very important. I  will pay careful consideration to his suggestion. I will discuss the issue with  officials and come back to him in writing as soon as possible.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Green Rebate</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Ms J  McCann </strong>asked the Minister of Finance and Personnel to detail the reasons  why tenants, who are renting Housing Executive properties, and who meet the  criteria to apply for a green rebate on their rates are excluded from doing so.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO890/09>(AQO 890/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: As Members are aware, the consultation on the detail  of the intended policy ended on 26 September. Officials briefed the Committee  for Finance and Personnel on the outcome of the process on 8 October, and they  are considering the responses to the consultation and the Committee&rsquo;s views,  which include members&rsquo; comments on the issue, before deciding on the way  forward. I will announce the final shape of the scheme shortly. The details  will also be set out and published as part of the consultation report on all  the remaining policy issues that emerged from the Executive&rsquo;s rating review  last year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I understand the Member&rsquo;s concerns, and I, too, would be  concerned if the policy were to disadvantage anyone, either intentionally or  unintentionally.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer. Given the recent huge rises in fuel  prices, will the Minister consider offering a green-loan scheme to people in  low-income households who cannot afford to pay upfront for energy-efficiency  measures?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I hear what the Member is saying, and that issue  arose during the Committee&rsquo;s deliberations. Ultimately, fuel-poverty issues are  matters for the Department for Social Development, but the ministerial subgroup  will also examine them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to rates relief, we are trying to encourage  improvements to the energy efficiency of housing stock, but I will take on  board what the Member said. The purpose of the consultation is to try to  complement the Northern Ireland Electricity (NIE) cashback scheme and to  supplement and complement the DSD warm homes scheme. For instance, if someone  on a low income comes forward, the Energy Saving Trust will advise them on the  appropriate way to proceed with insulation and energy-efficiency measures. The  trust will steer people in the right direction. It may be appropriate for them  to apply to the warm homes scheme, which is aimed at people who are on lower  incomes. However, if they are not eligible for that scheme, they will be  advised to go in the direction of the NIE cashback scheme or the rates-rebate  scheme.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, it may be more appropriate for people on low  incomes to apply for the warm homes scheme. Only if they are ineligible for  that scheme, which is aimed at those on low incomes, will they be advised to  seek assistance through the NIE cashback scheme or the rates-rebate scheme.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The issue must be considered in the round. However, the  real purpose of the rates relief in question is to improve the condition of the  housing stock. Fuel poverty is a matter for the Department for Social  Development, but it is a very important issue that we should address.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I call Mr Gardiner to ask a supplementary question.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  I do not wish to ask a supplementary question on that topic, Mr Speaker. Thank  you.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Higher Energy Costs</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">6. <strong>Mrs Long </strong>asked the Minister of Finance and Personnel for an update on the budgetary  pressures arising from higher energy costs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO883/09>(AQO  883/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: On 29 January, the Assembly approved the programme  of expenditure proposals for 2008-09 to 2010-2011, as set out in the Budget  document that was laid before the Assembly on 22 January. Those spending plans  reflected the position at that time, including expected cost pressures, and  will be subject to ongoing review as more up-to-date information becomes  available and further pressures, if any, emerge.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In particular, as part of the in-year monitoring process,  Departments will be able to put forward proposals to manage emerging pressures  from within their existing resources. They will also have the opportunity to  submit bids to my Department for additional resources if they are unable to  manage the pressure within their overall allocation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">During the September monitoring round, two Departments  submitted spending bids that were directly related to rising energy costs.  However, it is expected that the falling cost of crude oil will shortly be  reflected in utility costs, with the result that those pressures should be  reduced.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>:  The Minister mentioned that two Departments had included higher energy costs in  their September monitoring round responses. Will he tell the House which  Departments did that, and whether the bids were met? I seek assurance about  that because, for example, in the health or education sectors, where energy  costs may have a direct impact on the level of service that can be provided,  services might be cut if such costs are not met through the in-year monitoring  rounds.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I can inform the Member that, as part of the  September monitoring round, the Department of Education submitted a bid, as it  had in June. The Department for Regional Development submitted a bid for some  &pound;2&middot;3 million with respect to increasing the public-lighting energy tariff.  There were no other bids from other Departments in respect of energy costs.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I understand what the Member said about the impact of those  costs. However, when the Budget was agreed in January, crude oil cost about $95  a barrel. The current price is about $60 a barrel. That is a significant drop  of almost 40%. Therefore, although there is a lag between the price of crude  oil and the price that is passed on to the customer &mdash; and we wish to ensure  that lower crude oil prices translate into lower utility bills for businesses,  Departments, Government and individuals &mdash; there is no doubt that that reduction  in the price should relieve the burden considerably in future.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  Does the Minister agree that, bearing in mind that the question was about  energy and that there have been many references to fuel poverty, including from  Members opposite, it stresses that it is imperative that the Executive should  meet to take decisions on tackling fuel poverty?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The Member raises an extremely important point. He  and other Members will recognise the measures that have already been taken by  the Executive in relation to fuel poverty issues, not least the freeze in  regional rates over the next three years, the deferral of water charges, the  cap on manufacturing and business rates, and the fact that householders in  Northern Ireland will be &pound;1,000 better off over the comprehensive spending  review period than they would been had direct rule continued.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, more must be done. The Minister for Social  Development and others have highlighted, rightly, the need to push the energy  companies, as well as simply looking to Government. However, the Executive must  meet to take decisions on such matters.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is absolutely intolerable and unacceptable that, given  those issues and wider economic issues, one party is not prepared to come to  the Executive and give priority to those issues. The First Minister&rsquo;s offer of  an Executive meeting tomorrow with an open agenda means that this issue, along  with many others, could be discussed straight away. There is no excuse for  holding back on this or any other issue.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. In recent times, there has been much  media talk of the need for the Executive to meet, particularly on the subject  of fuel poverty, and proposals have been made by the Department for Social  Development. Have those proposals been fully costed, and is the Department of  Finance and Personnel in a position to provide the finance for them?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Several suggestions and proposals have been made.  One of the reasons for the decision to set up a ministerial subgroup was to  ensure that all the issues were examined in detail and to determine the best  and most effective response by the Executive to the issue of higher energy  prices. Not the least of those issues was the fact that we need to talk to the  energy companies in order to discover how to target those who need help,  possibly through some form of fuel credit. There are other issues to discuss as  well. However, we are not yet in a position to allocate resources to a fuel  credit scheme, because any such credit could not be paid before March 2009 in  any case. Work must be done on identifying those who might be eligible and on  the processes by which such payments could be made. In the discussions that  took place with the energy suppliers, it became clear that such payments could  not be made any earlier than the March 2009 utility bills.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Work still has to be done, and progress has to be made. The  ministerial subgroup is working on those issues, but there will come a point  when they will have to be presented to the Executive for a decision. At that  stage, all Ministers will have to decide, given the need to provide resources  to such a plan, the areas on which less money will be spent by their respective  Departments. I reiterate that money to be spent on new proposals must be found  from allocations that have already been made. That will require an Executive  meeting and an Executive decision. I cannot take that decision; nor can any  other individual Minister.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">HR Connect</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">7. <strong>Miss  McIlveen </strong>asked the Minister of Finance and Personnel what progress has been  made on HR Connect.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO819/09>(AQO  819/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: HR Connect will modernise the personnel function  throughout the Northern Ireland Civil Service and the Northern Ireland Office.  It will replace outdated IT systems, modernise personnel processes through  greater use of self-service facilities by staff, and provide centralised  support services from a shared-service centre.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The shared-service centre has been set up, and is fully  staffed and operational. The first HR Connect external recruitment exercise was  launched in October 2007, and was followed by the phased release of employee  relations in HR services between mid-November 2007 and the end of January 2008.  Work on the remaining HR Connect services is progressing well.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms McIlveen</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his response. To what extent have staff been prepared  for HR Connect? Can the Minister allay any concerns that staff may have about  the security of sensitive data?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I thank the Member for her question. Both issues are  of concern to staff. There has been full communication with the trade union  side as part of the implementation of such a major programme. Training in  communication has also been undertaken in order to prepare staff in the new  services.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Data security is a very important issue, which I and my  officials take very seriously. The Civil Service accreditation panel, which is  the body that scrutinises new IT systems and determines whether they meet  Government standards, reviews and approves the physical and technical security  measures that are in place for HR Connect.

	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">9. <strong>Mr  Attwood </strong>asked the Minister of Finance and Personnel if he will set up a  competition analysis board, with an obligation to issue annual reports, on the  model of the National Competitiveness Council in the Republic of Ireland, as  recommended by Sir David Varney.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO924/09>(AQO  924/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I can see that the Member is probably as surprised  as I am that we have reached this stage. <span class="Italic">[Laughter]</span>.  I think that question 8 has been transferred to another Department, given that  it concerns a matter that is the responsibility of OFMDFM.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Sir David Varney recommended that a competition analysis  board be established in the Office of the First Minister and deputy First  Minister. Although I appreciate the reasons for that recommendation, it should  be noted that much of the work that has been published by the National  Competitiveness Council in the Republic has already been produced in the  Executive. However, I will look at how that information is made available and  presented to the public.</p>

	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Debate resumed on motion:</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly recognises the suffering of families of  the disappeared; believes that there has not been full disclosure on this  issue; and calls on any individual or organisation with information which may  lead to the remains of the disappeared being returned to their loved ones for  dignified burial, to bring forward that information without any further delay &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Mr D Bradley.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. Before we resume the debate, I wish to make Members aware that I have  some concerns about comments that were made earlier in the debate. I will  consider the Official Report, and I may return to the matter in due course.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I acknowledge the motion and the remarks that Dominic Bradley made when moving  it. His comments were characterised by compassion and dignity. That is  inevitable, given that the families of the disappeared have displayed those  qualities over the many years since the deaths of their loved ones.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It must be remembered that the recovery of the bodies of  the disappeared is an essential part of any truth process. Indeed, in some  parts of the world, it constitutes the essence of a truth process. If one  considers what is happening in Chile  and in other Latin American countries, or what has been happening in Spain over the  past two or three weeks as a consequence of the civil war there, the issue of  the recovery of the bodies of those killed &mdash; or the disappeared &mdash; can never be  laid to rest. It must always be part of the truth process of any society that  is emerging from conflict.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, as we await the Eames/Bradley group&rsquo;s report,  which may be published before Christmas, it is important that that group  understands that, in respect of the recovery of the bodies of the disappeared &mdash;  or of any other matter concerning the interests and needs of victims and  survivors &mdash; there cannot be any arbitrary deadline after which no further work  can be done. The Eames/Bradley group must recommend that, in respect of those  matters, no such deadline is appropriate. The group must, therefore, recommend  that time must be allowed for all such matters to be resolved, if at all possible.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The value of the motion is that the issue of the bodies of  the disappeared is part of the wider narrative of what illegal terror  organisations visited upon the people of Northern Ireland. In this case,  that is the nationalist community of Northern Ireland, given that all  those who were killed came from the Catholic tradition. Given that the  Eames/Bradley group is about to publish its report, I trust that that will  record the narrative of what so-called republican organisations visited upon  the nationalist community, including the issue of the disappeared. In its  statement before the summer, the Eames/Bradley group was silent about what  illegal terror organisations from the nationalist tradition visited upon the  nationalist community, not least in respect of the bodies of the disappeared.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, that was part of the terror that was visited  upon the nationalist community by the IRA and others over the years of  conflict. As we know, and as Dominic Bradley and others stated, 14 people were  killed &mdash; 10 claimed by the IRA and one by the INLA.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As we speak, the disappearance of three of the bodies has  not been attributed to any illegal organisation. Therefore, I listened closely  to Gerry Adams as he outlined how he believed that the IRA had co-operated with  the commission in respect of the bodies of the disappeared.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although the disappearance of three of the bodies has not  been attributed to any organisation, it is the belief and conviction of those  three families that those individuals were taken away and murdered by the IRA.  Therefore, the IRA has a responsibility to revisit and reassess the issue to  determine whether that was done unilaterally or independently and whether those  deaths were authorised or unauthorised. Was the IRA responsible for the deaths  of those three people who are missing and whose disappearance has not yet been  attributed to any one person or organisation?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion touches upon a broader issue; disclosure must be  the cornerstone of any healing and any truth in respect of the past. Debates  have taken place in the Chamber on the Police Ombudsman&rsquo;s report into the investigation  into the death of Raymond McCord Jnr and on the secret investigation into MI5  intelligence on the Omagh bombing. Those issues, the MOD&rsquo;s obstruction of the  Historical Enquiries Team&rsquo;s investigation of British Army killings, and the  McCartney murder show that, without disclosure, we will not be able to deal  with the past and we will not be able to move forward on a wholesale basis.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  welcome the opportunity to debate this important matter. During the Troubles,  families who lost innocent loved ones had a great wrong done to them; but those  whose loved ones disappeared suffered a double loss. They came home one evening  and their loved one was not there, and they were not there the following  evening, or the following week or month, resulting in the slow realisation that  their loved one was not coming home. Those families had to accept the fact that  the one whom they loved and cared for would no longer be part of their family.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There was no doctor&rsquo;s certificate or coroner&rsquo;s report;  there was no body, funeral service or graveyard committal. Those families had  nothing; they were left with emptiness. In that respect, the loss that those  families suffered superseded the loss that other people suffered during the  Troubles. In many cases, people were able to identify what had happened and how  it had happened, and they learned to cope with what had happened to their loved  ones. The families of the disappeared did not have that to hold on to.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, we have a duty to ensure that those people and  their families get justice. I have met people whose relatives were among the  disappeared. I welcome the fact that the Assembly is discussing the matter  today and that we can lay out our support for the families of the disappeared.  I expect that the motion will receive unanimous support in the Chamber.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Some people can do a bit more than simply say that the  families of the disappeared should receive the remains of their loved ones, and  no stone should remain unturned in doing that. I do not know whether everything  that can be done has been done, but I doubt it. The IRA was one of the main  perpetrators of the wrongs that took place against the disappeared. Given the  political process in which we are engaged, it is incumbent upon Sinn F&eacute;in,  which is so closely linked with the IRA, to ensure that all is done to get  those remains returned to their loved ones.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The families have acted with great dignity throughout the  adversity that they have faced. They have not targeted Sinn F&eacute;in in a political  way. Rather, they have simply sought what is rightfully theirs &mdash; the return of  the remains of their loved ones.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I implore Members of Sinn F&eacute;in in particular to do  everything within their power to ensure that that great wrong is put right, and  that the families of the disappeared receive the remains of their loved ones as  soon as physically possible.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I thank all those Members who spoke during the debate. It has been a solemn  debate, as Mr Kennedy said, but a worthwhile one, because it highlighted a  particularly painful issue, and one that should be a matter of great public  concern to everyone.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Dominic Bradley should be congratulated for tabling the  motion. His speech reflected the concern of many, although perhaps not all,  Members that the matter is dealt with in a compassionate way. The motion  promotes the ultimate goal of the families of the disappeared, which is to have  the remains of their loved ones returned. That is the important aspect of the  motion. It is not about scoring political points, but about promoting the  objective of bringing home the remains of loved ones who were victims of  paramilitary and terrorist violence.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Bradley should be commended for asking for restraint in  the debate, and for the concerns and feelings of the families to be taken into  consideration. It is important to remember that the families want closure. They  do not want to be part and parcel of a political debate, no matter how tempting  that may seem to some Members. The families want closure; that is their  objective, and that is why they would, in general terms, be supportive of the  motion. They have waited and suffered for a long time. It is clear from most  contributions to the debate that most Members share that view, and want to see  an end to the families&rsquo; suffering.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Allegations were made and refuted in the House. However, it  is not my place to comment on those, other than to say that they were raised,  and were refuted, and we move on.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Independent Commission for the Location of Victims&rsquo;  Remains has a responsible and important role. It has been given the  technological resources and expertise in order to locate the remains of people.  It is important that that process continues. I share Mr Bradley&rsquo;s anxiety when  he says that the commission is halfway through its mandate, and if it does not  succeed during the latter part, that mandate should be renewed until there is a  clear end to the suffering of the relatives. It is important that we show  solidarity with the families, and, in a collective way, as many Members on all  sides of the House have done, plead with people who have information to bring  it to the authorities and, in particular, to the commission.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are many ways to bring that information forward. The  best way is to go directly to the lawful authorities and the commission and to  apprise them of the information. As some Members said, that information may  seem trivial or unimportant, but it may well be of great importance when  properly analysed by those who have the expertise to make that analysis.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The commission continues its work, and has a dedicated  team. It is very important that those families are not forgotten, and that the  resources are available for them and for their friends and relatives. I agree  with Dr Stephen Farry that, with regard to the Richter scale of violence and  evil perpetrated in our society, this is very near to the top, if not at the  top, because of the evil nature of the deeds. For Jean McConville, for example,  to be taken from her children and murdered was a foul deed, and one that cries  to the very heavens for justice. How any organisation could justify that defies  logic and ordinary justice.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As Tom Elliott said, it is important that we continue to  support those families in their search. It is heartening for them that there  has been so much support coming from all sides of the House. I hope that that  support will continue over and beyond this debate, because we sometimes come to  the House and make grand statements and then forget about them and move on. We  should not forget those families. We should not move on. We must continue to  apply public pressure where necessary and where it can be effective, and to  encourage people to bring forward information.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As Alex Attwood said, it is important that disclosure must  be the cornerstone of any process of truth-finding. It is incumbent on all  parties involved in our society and in the conflict that took place that they  commit themselves to the process of disclosure. Everyone contributed to the  debate in a spirit which, I hope, was meant to facilitate the families. That  spirit must be retained. It is important that we move on and try to bring some  closure to those families who have suffered so much for too long.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly recognises the suffering of families of  the disappeared; believes that there has not been full disclosure on this  issue; and calls on any individual or organisation with information which may  lead to the remains of the disappeared being returned to their loved ones for  dignified burial, to bring forward that information without any further delay.</p>

	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Maintenance of Waterways by the Department of  Agriculture and Rural Development in the Upper Bann  Constituency</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I remind Members that the proposer of the topic for debate will have 15 minutes  in which to speak. All other Members will have approximately 10 minutes.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  From the earliest times, rivers have been a focal point for human activity. Man  settled close to rivers and became dependent on them for survival. Rivers  formed a working part of both the rural and urban industrial landscapes.  Although there are many benefits to living adjacent to rivers, there can be  many disadvantages, particularly the risk of flooding. The effects of flooding  can be devastating: roads closed; homes and farms severely damaged; and public  services, industry and commerce disrupted. Communities suffer from fear,  anxiety and hardships during periods of flooding.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I witnessed such events in August, in Lurgan, Craigavon and  Banbridge where there was extensive flooding, and many homes were damaged.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Agriculture and Rural Development is the  statutory drainage and flood-protection authority for Northern Ireland.  Under the terms of the Drainage (Northern Ireland)  Order 1973, the Department has discretionary powers to maintain watercourses  and sea defences, which have been designated by the Drainage Council for Northern Ireland;  construct and maintain drainage and flood-defence structures; and administer  advisory and enforcement procedures to protect the drainage function of all  watercourses.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">All executive functions that arise from the Department&rsquo;s  statutory remit under the Drainage (Northern Ireland) Order 1973 are  undertaken by the Rivers Agency, which also exercises the Department&rsquo;s  responsibilities for the regulation of the water levels in Lough Neagh. In  exercising its functions, the agency is required to adhere to the Department&rsquo;s  countryside management strategy.</p>
	      <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Dallat] in the Chair)</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Drainage Council for Northern   Ireland is a non-departmental public body constituted  under the Drainage (Northern    Ireland) Order 1973. The council has a  general scrutiny role in relation to the Department&rsquo;s drainage functions and  has a statutory duty to ensure uniformity in the treatment of drainage  throughout Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have outlined DARD&rsquo;s responsibilities with regard to the  maintenance of watercourses and to drainage because of the colossal failure in  the management of watercourses in Upper Bann.  Although the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development is a statutory consultee  on planning issues, many homes at Knockramer Meadows in Craigavon were  destroyed when a river burst its banks in the August floods. People are still  coping with the consequences of that, and one wonders what DARD&rsquo;s response was  to the planning application for those homes. We have not yet heard how DARD  will remedy with the developer the ongoing problem and allay the fears of  residents in that area. No wall was built to protect those homes from the  river.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I accept that DARD does not hold all the responsibility,  but that is part of the problem. In addition to DARD, the Department of the  Environment and the Department for Regional Development have responsibility. As  we saw in the summer floods, that is very confusing for people.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have just seen the Minister in the Chamber &mdash; I  congratulate her on the birth of her child and thank her for taking the time to  come to the debate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">One problem that constituents find is that there is no  one-stop shop, and people do not know who to contact if there is a problem.  Local authorities have a statutory responsibility for emergency planning &mdash;  thankfully, that is fairly new and has not been exercised. As the Minister  knows, there were several problems in the recent floods. Therefore, in addition  to the three Departments, local councils have responsibility.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">While I was doing some research for the debate, I discovered  that responsibility for a blocked watercourse is dependent on whether the water  is flowing. If the water is flowing, the local council&rsquo;s environmental health  services should be contacted, and if it is blocked, the Northern Ireland  Environment Agency is responsible. In any other cases, the Rivers Agency is  responsible. If a concerned member of the public shows some civic  responsibility and makes a phone call about a block in a watercourse, he or she  should only have to ring one number. I hope that the Minister will reflect on  that and consult with her ministerial colleagues on it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As the Minister knows, the River Bann and the River Lagan  run through the Upper Bann constituency. The  southern shores of Lough Neagh also form part of my constituency. Those are  areas of special scientific interest.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are also wetlands close to where I live. Part of the  problem is that there does not appear to be any routine, regular maintenance or  checking of culverts in the area. In June, one of those culverts collapsed. As  a result, part of a road caved in. In such a rural area, where there are no  public sewerage works, watercourses are the drainage outlets for septic tanks.  That created a backlog that drained into the fields and wetlands. Therefore,  not only did the area experience excessive rainfall during that time, but a  foul odour persisted as a result.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members of the public who wanted to report that collapsed  culvert did not know which agency to ring. They rang Roads Service, but were  passed from one Department to another. That is a huge problem. Regular, routine  maintenance and checking of culverts is needed. I accept that a lot of drains  are many years old. In the north Lurgan area, foul-water drains and storm  drains run into the same sewage-treatment system. Whether or not that is the  Department for Regional Development&rsquo;s responsibility, it has an impact on the  watercourse, for which DARD has oversight. I want my constituency&rsquo;s natural  heritage, particularly the wetlands and areas of special scientific interest,  to be protected, not only for the well-being of people who live in the area,  but to preserve the countryside&rsquo;s flora and fauna.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is always great debate about the role of farmers in  watercourse maintenance. Often, farmers are blamed for pollution; sometimes,  rightly so. In recent years, there has been discussion about the level of  phosphates being spread on fields. Although there is great compliance with the  nitrates directive, there is a problem with the use of phosphates. It is  actually less expensive for farmers to use more natural methods and to reduce  the level of fertiliser that they spread on their fields. I am not sure whether  the Minister has taken action on that issue, although I believe that a pilot  project was to be undertaken.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Work must also be done on the European water framework  directive. The Minister&rsquo;s Department is carrying out flood mapping of all the  counties in the North. I understand that in the Republic of Ireland,  a much more extensive flood-mapping project is being carried out. That ties in  with DARD&rsquo;s role as a consultee in planning matters. Can the Minister explain  how people who want to buy houses will be protected and how developers who wish  to buy land and apply for planning permission will be able to gain access to those  flood maps? Will they be charged for that access?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The difficulties that arise from the cross-cutting nature  of watercourse management across several agencies are not only experienced by  the public; I am sure that the Minister&rsquo;s colleagues also encounter them when  trying to research who has responsibility for certain matters. In the past few  months, when extensive flooding occurred in my constituency, part of the  problem lay with Rivers Agency. People in one part of my constituency had to  report to the Lisburn office, and people in the other part to the office in Armagh. That creates difficulties, even for the local  council&rsquo;s emergency planning. During the flooding, some sandbags had to come  from Lisburn, and some from elsewhere. Advice on what to do in the event of an  emergency must be provided from a central location.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I remember that when I was a little girl, the &ldquo;Ministry  men&rdquo; took care of watercourse management. They used to come out regularly and  clean the drains and bogs. Every year, I would have seen them working. That is  not the case any longer. Can the Minister indicate whether the budget for that  work has been maintained and how the situation will be remedied? There has been  a great deficit in investment in infrastructure and maintenance of waterways  throughout Northern Ireland,  particularly in my constituency.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The amount of pollution caused by the non-compliance of  sewage treatment works in Upper Bann, particularly in the Closet River  around Craigavon, is a matter of great concern. The Minister is aware that  Lough Neagh is the main reservoir of drinking water for Belfast  and greater Belfast.  However, the poor management of watercourses and the poor quality of rivers and  streams cause Lough Neagh&rsquo;s water quality to fall well below the standards  required by European directives. What action is the Minister taking, or  prepared to take, over the next two to five years to improve the environment  and the quality of the water for those who drink it?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  congratulate the Minister on the birth of her daughter, Aoise Geraldine. I am  sure that she and her husband are very proud. I met the Minister&rsquo;s mother the  other day, and she is an extremely proud grandmother. I thank the Minister for  attending today to respond to questions raised in the debate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank Mrs Kelly for securing today&rsquo;s debate. It is timely  because, as recently as 21 October 2008, the Assembly discussed promoting Lough  Neagh as a tourist attraction. However, any problems with the waterways that  flow into Lough Neagh will prevent it developing to its full potential. Other  Members raised several issues, and I have no doubt that those wishing to speak  will raise further matters.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On 16 August 2008, the Halfpenny River  caused severe flooding in the Knockramer Meadows area of Lurgan, and that must  be investigated. I thank the Rivers Agency for its prompt action and for twice  meeting local residents in the aftermath of the flood. The agency carefully  explained to residents the processes involved in a long-term flood defence for  that river, and it committed to regular patrolling of the river to ensure that  large objects are not blocking culverts, because that seems to have been one of  the causes of the severe flooding.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mrs Kelly is correct that questions must be asked: why were  flood defences not built in the first place to protect the developments along  the Halfpenny River, and why did the Planning Service  allow those developments to proceed? I welcome the fact that the Rivers Agency  is now closely examining that matter.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Closet   River was mentioned  during the Assembly&rsquo;s debate on Lough Neagh. It also concerns not only environmentalists  but local farmers whose land surrounds it. Although the Department of  Agriculture and Rural Development does not have direct responsibility for the  river, the sewage that is being pumped into the river overflows onto farmers&rsquo;  land and has caused severe pollution in the past. In future developments at the  waterworks, I hope that the Environment Agency in particular will keep its  promise that discharges will not contain the raw sewage that was previously  discharged on farmers&rsquo; land. I hope that that process will stop, but only time  will tell.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those who live in the Craigavon area of Upper   Bann are in a strange position because the River Bann divides it.  When the Rivers Agency responded to the recent flooding, some people had to  report to Lisburn and others to Portadown, yet they come from areas that are  close together. After the flooding at Knockramer, it would have been far easier  for residents to go to Portadown than to Lisburn, although I understand that  the Portadown depot provided sandbags for the area and assisted in dealing with  the flooding.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I also thank the &ldquo;Ministry men&rdquo;, as Mrs Kelly called them,  who turned up in Knockramer late in the evening and started to clear culverts,  and so forth. After a long and miserable day, they came to carry out work, and  their arrival was welcome. The watercourses in Upper Bann  require attention, as do those across the North. However, those in that area  require particular attention because they flow into Lough Neagh. The lough is a  major water supplier and a sizeable nature reserve, and, as was discussed in  the House two weeks ago, it has much tourist potential that must be fulfilled.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I mentioned the River Halfpenny and River Closet. We must  learn from past experiences of planning developments close to rivers. In August  2008, the River Halfpenny, which is, usually, merely a stream, became a raging  torrent within hours.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  I congratulate the Minister on the birth of her baby daughter.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I declare an interest as a member of Craigavon Borough  Council, which has interest in the surrounding areas of Lough Neagh.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to raise several issues about the management of the Upper Bann, and the Lough Neagh basin into which the  River Bann flows. The Upper Bann waterway  system and the entire Lough Neagh basin is one of the great underdeveloped  tourist and recreation resources in the Province, and the lack of a single  co-ordinating authority contributes to the problem. On several occasions, I  have put on record my support for the creation of a Lough Neagh authority,  which would expand the area&rsquo;s tourist potential and assume responsibility for  the management of all the waters in the region.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The fragmentation, which currently exists, does not provide  a good basis for progress. We require an executive body that is directly  accountable to the Assembly through one of the Departments, rather than one  that merely facilitates co-ordination. For some time I have been concerned that  the apportionment of responsibilities to existing Departments is incorrect. For  example, it is strange that the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development  has responsibility for flooding: it would be more logical for the Department of  the Environment to handle that matter. Also, responses to flooding would be  better if managed by one Department. In addition, the region&rsquo;s tourism falls  under the remit of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Regardless of the way in which one approaches the matter,  there are several ministries involved in the management of different aspects of  the Upper Bann and the Lough Neagh basin. That  is why the introduction of an overarching body to manage the region makes sense  and will keep local &mdash; as opposed to ministerial &mdash; executive responsibility in  one place. Furthermore, it might enable the injection of energy, which is,  inevitably, lacking when there are several Northern Ireland Departments  managing one particular issue. Too much time is consumed by co-ordination and  not enough time is spent on the directional energy needed to improve the  region.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is a pattern of increasing recreation and tourism in  the region based around honeypot sites such as Kinnego Marina. In addition, the  Upper Bann has important fishing grounds.  However, there is no statutory navigation authority for Lough Neagh, the River  Blackwater and the Upper Bann. A number of local  councils enforce rules and regulations in the vicinity of the marinas and  facilities around Lough Neagh.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The bed and soil of Lough Neagh are owned by the  Shaftesbury Estate. Therefore, many infrastructural developments on the lough &mdash;  such as piers, jetties and navigational markers &mdash; cannot commence without the  owner&rsquo;s agreement. The Rivers Agency and the Department of Agriculture and  Rural Development exercise a statutory rule to regulate Lough Neagh&rsquo;s water  levels, taking account of weather conditions and the needs of a wide range of  users including boating, farming, fisheries and conservation groups. We need  rationalisation of the confusion of authority, rights and operational methods.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>: I  declare an interest as a member of Craigavon Borough Council, and I commend my  fellow Member from Upper Bann Mrs Kelly for securing the Adjournment debate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, I congratulate the Minister on the birth of  her daughter. It is nice to see her back, and we look forward to seeing her in  the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Upper Bann has some of the  most scenic waterways in the Province. Although colleagues from South Antrim may have something to say about it, the  tourism potential of Lough Neagh is massive and untapped. Only last Tuesday,  the House debated that issue. Upper Bann&rsquo;s  waterways could prove valuable to the local economy. We need assurances from  the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development that the waterways will be  maintained to a high standard so that we can realise their tourist potential.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Agriculture and Rural Development,  however, is not solely responsible for all that is wrong with Upper   Bann&rsquo;s waterways; there are major issues with the quality of water  pumped into our rivers and into Lough Neagh. The pollution in and around the  Ballynacor treatment works is an absolute disgrace: I have raised that matter  with the Minister for Regional Development. Mrs Kelly mentioned the lack of  joined-up Government in this respect. I will not repeat what she and others  have said, but Northern Ireland Water continues to investigate serious issues  in connection with the Closet   River. Lough Neagh is the  largest freshwater lake in the British Isles,  but at this rate of pollution the water will not remain fresh for much longer.  Drastic action must be taken.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr O&rsquo;Dowd referred to another local issue that is the  responsibility of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. On  Saturday 16 August, Northern    Ireland was subjected to a massive deluge &mdash;  a once-in-a-100-year storm, the weather experts tell us. On that day, the  Rivers Bann and Lagan and all the main rivers in the area overflowed, damaging  potato crops and cereals. An answer to a question that I received today from  the Minister states that the estimated damage to farms in the Upper   Bann constituency alone, based on input costs, is &pound;97,000 in respect  of potatoes and &pound;66,000 in respect of cereals. No one can do much about the  storm; that is something over which we have no control. However, I call upon  the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development to clarify urgently whether  compensation will be paid to the farmers affected.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I urge that consideration be given to the creation of a  single body to administer, maintain and promote the waterways of the Upper Bann constituency, and I call on the Executive to  give that matter urgent consideration. The tourist and economic potential of  Lough Neagh needs vision and imagination if it is to develop. If we are serious  about caring for future generations, we must use all the potential at our  disposal.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I stress to the Minister, however, that before anything else  is done, we must eliminate the flow of undesirable stuff into Lough Neagh &mdash; and  I express myself as mildly as possible. I ask the Minister to address those  issues; knowing her and her Department, they will be taken seriously.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I, too, add my congratulations to the Minister and wish her family  every blessing for the future.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development (Ms Gildernew)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat. I am  grateful to everyone for their kind words and comments. I thank Dolores for  giving the Assembly an opportunity to discuss waterway maintenance in the Upper Bann constituency. I have not quite returned to  work, so you will not see me in Committee for a while yet, George. I returned  to the House for this debate because I believe that it is important; but I will  be off work for a wee while and for that, I ask Members to bear with me. I  thank other Members for their kind words and their contributions to the debate:  John O&rsquo;Dowd, Sam Gardiner and George Savage.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I recognise the strategic importance of Lough Neagh, and  its importance for tourism. Even though the weather was not great, my family  spent a few lovely days this year enjoying the amenities at Kinnegoe  Embankment. We had a great time.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I recognise that the wetlands of Lough Neagh are  environmentally important, and I recognise that the lough is important to the  local area. I am also a very keen advocate of the restoration of the Ulster Canal,  which links Lough Neagh to the River Blackwater, the Shannon-Erne waterway and  Lough Erne. I have been working on that from a constituency basis, and I  recognise that it would open up Lough Neagh&rsquo;s potential. It is also important  that the infrastructure be right.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I recognise that the farming community and the public have  very real concerns about watercourse maintenance, in view of the serious  flooding events of 16 and 17 August. I am conscious that the Upper   Bann constituency unfortunately experienced severe flooding at  that time. I emphasise that the events in August were exceptional and exceeded  the design standards of drainage infrastructure at many locations. However,  having seen the effects of the flooding, I very strongly sympathise with those  who were affected. It is very traumatic to have one&rsquo;s home, business or farm  flooded.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Government provided funds for district councils to make  emergency payments to householders who suffered losses, and I am aware that  farmers in Upper Bann suffered crop losses, as  George Savage pointed out. The assessment of the losses to the farming industry  in the North is now complete, and it is evident that potato growers suffered  the greatest losses due to the very high crop-input costs and the  susceptibility of the crop to flooding. My officials are discussing that issue  with the Department of Finance and Personnel, and I will follow that up at  ministerial level in the next few days. I hope to be able to clarify the  position shortly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My proposals will be similar to the de minimis payment  scheme. Potato growers who suffered because of the flooding incident will  receive payments of up to &euro;7,500. Any payments will take losses incurred by  individual growers into account. Hopefully, we will have a response on that in  the near future.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the meantime, the Rivers Agency continues to investigate  flooding incidence and the scope for remedial action. It has already carried  out immediate critical repairs to major flood defences, and I am conscious that  questions were raised about maintenance issues. Throughout the North of  Ireland, the Rivers Agency currently maintains approximately 6,800 km of  designated watercourses and associated flood defences, which largely provide  protection to built property.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The agency carries out a cyclical programme of inspection  and maintenance of designated watercourses to ensure free flow. In response to  severe weather warnings, the agency increases inspection and maintenance of  grilles at vulnerable locations where obstructions are likely to impede flow  and increase flood risk. That maintenance work has an essential  flood-management focus.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I also commend the staff of the Rivers Agency, whom I have  seen out working during events like the August floods to which I referred. Even  at weekends, they go to work when they are needed and it is all hands on deck.  They work very hard to prevent homes and businesses from being flooded,  although that is not always possible.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">To put it into context, the Rivers Agency does not have a  legislative remit to carry out maintenance on watercourses purely for amenity  or aesthetic purposes. The agency will only intervene where bank erosion  threatens flood defences, roads or built property. That is all that the agency  can do legally. Adjacent landowners have a responsibility to maintain  undesignated watercourses. The Rivers Agency has an advisory and enforcement  role in protecting the drainage function of all watercourses for  flood-management purposes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When Government recently responded to a review of  flood-management policy, we took account of representations from the farming  community about rural watercourse maintenance. The Rivers Agency continues to  maintain designated watercourses in the interests of drainage and flood  management. That work must be carried out in an environmentally sensitive manner  in order to satisfy the principles of sustainability and EU obligations. There  are many EU directives with which we must comply. The work must be done in an  environmentally sensitive way &mdash; a point that was made by Mrs Dolores Kelly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is no evidence to suggest that a lack of maintenance  of designated watercourses contributed significantly to the flooding in August.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I assure Members that Rivers Agency will investigate all  watercourse-related flooding incidents, as well as the scope that exists for  remedial action to be taken, including maintenance of those watercourses that  have been mentioned in the debate, such as the Halfpenny River.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Proactive flood-risk management is proposed in the  Government response to the flood-management policy review, and we will take  full account of the needs of watercourse maintenance and the concerns expressed  during the debate. I accept Mr Gardiner&rsquo;s frustration that some of the  flood-management responsibilities are split among different Departments, and we  must assess how those issues are managed. My Department will work closely with  Department of the Environment and Department for Regional Development officials  to try to bring a joined-up-government approach to bear.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mrs Kelly asked about an incident line, and I can confirm  that a number to be called in the event of flooding will be introduced before  the end of the year. That number will be: 0300 2000 100. Press releases will be  issued and other publicity undertaken when that number comes into operation.  The advantage of that number is that the people who will take the calls will  know to which agencies to direct the information, and that will ensure that  problems are dealt with as quickly as possible.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My Department will tomorrow launch the strategic flood  maps, which will be free and available online. The maps are very professional &mdash;  I saw them in advance, and I am pleased with the Rivers Agency&rsquo;s work on them.  The flood maps will be freely available in the next few days, and I am keen  that statutory agencies and other people use them to try to avoid repeating  past mistakes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If I have not responded to any local maintenance issues  that were raised, I am happy for the Rivers Agency to respond individually  about those. I thank those Members who participated in the debate for creating  an opportunity to discuss flood issues in Upper Bann.  My Department wants to continue working with representatives of that  constituency &mdash; as we do with all constituencies &mdash; to try to alleviate the  misery of flooding and some of the associated problems. We accept that we  cannot sort out every problem, but we will do everything within the legislative  framework to try to avoid flood incidents. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
