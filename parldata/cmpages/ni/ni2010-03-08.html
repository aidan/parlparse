    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The Assembly met at 12.00 noon (Mr Speaker in the  Chair).</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
    <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="1"></a>Assembly Business</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Points of Order</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Before we proceed to today&rsquo;s business, I will refer briefly to some points of  order that were raised during last week&rsquo;s sittings. I remind the House that, in  the past, I have encouraged Members to raise matters of concern with me outside  the Chamber rather than on the Floor of the House.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Over the past number of weeks, there has been an abuse of  points of order in the House to the point where Members are using them to have  debates on points of order. Rather than raising issues through points of order  in the House, Members would be better off talking to me outside the Chamber,  because they would achieve so much more.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also caution Members not to seek to use points of order  to start debates on points of order either with me or with other Members. I  have already spoken to some of the Members who raised points of order last  week, and I intend to speak to others today or tomorrow.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I warn the Member not to raise any point of order that he has already raised in  the House. I have given the Member quite a bit of latitude. I have had two  face-to-face meetings with him, and I have allowed him to raise the same point  of order on at least four occasions. If it is a totally different point of  order, I am happy to take it, provided that it is a point of order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. You may recall that, beyond the matter that I  have raised on four separate occasions, I raised a separate point of order last  week with you in relation to the comment made by a Member who referred to the  &ldquo;stigma&rdquo; in relation to applicants to the PSNI. I invited you to make a ruling  on that matter because it impacted not necessarily on Members but on &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. I made a very clear ruling on 24 November 2009 that we needed to move  away from examining specific words that are used in the Chamber, because, when  it comes to unparliamentary language, it means different things to different  Members. On 24 November 2009, my ruling was absolutely clear. Members might  believe that that is a weakening of my position; I assure them that it is not.  I assure Members who still believe that they can cross the line that they will  be dealt with, albeit in a different way, in the hope that we can bring dignity  to the House.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member should not go there. I had a discussion with him  and Mr McDevitt this morning about a range of issues and how I intend to deal  with them in the future. I have sympathy with what the Member has said to me  privately this morning and with his comments in the House. However, I ask the Member  and the whole House to allow me to develop this issue.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  Further to that point of order, Mr Speaker. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span> Some Members might yawn in relation to the authority and integrity of the  House; that is a reflection on them. This morning&rsquo;s conversations were about  comments that Members have made about other Members. This is about &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Member is coming very close to challenging my authority and ruling  on the issue. I ask the Member to reflect on and be careful about what he is  saying. I will not take any further points of order on the issue, and I will  now move on.</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="2"></a>Suspension of Standing Orders</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cobain</strong>: I  beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That Standing Orders 10(2) to 10(4) be suspended for 8 March  2010.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Before I put the Question, I remind Members that the motion requires  cross-community support.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved (with cross-community support):</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That Standing Orders 10(2) to 10(4) be suspended for 8 March  2010.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  As the motion has been agreed, today&rsquo;s sitting may go beyond 7.00 pm, if  required.</p>
    <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="3"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">North/South Ministerial Council</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Special EU Programmes &nbsp;Sectoral Format</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have received notice from the Minister of Finance and Personnel that he  wishes to make a statement.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel &nbsp;(Mr S Wilson)</strong>:  I note that the House was in enthusiastic form this morning for that first  vote.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The North/South Ministerial Council (NSMC) met in special  EU programmes sectoral format in Dublin  on 17 February 2010. The Council last met in that format in September 2009. The  Government of the Republic   of Ireland were  represented by Finance Minister, Brian Lenihan, who chaired the meeting. I  represented the Northern Ireland Executive and was accompanied by the Social  Development Minister, Margaret Ritchie.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Pat Colgan, chief executive of the Special EU Programmes  Body (SEUPB), provided an update on the progress of its work since September 2008.  He advised that the Peace II and INTERREG IIIa programmes, which relate to the  2000-06 EU funding period, are now in the final stages of closure. SEUPB  remains confident that both programmes will earn all the relevant EU receipts.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Colgan advised us of the progress of the current Peace  III programme and the cross-border INTERREG IVa programme. Since 2007, both  programmes have been receiving and assessing funding applications from  throughout their respective eligible areas. Mr Colgan reported that both  programmes were performing well. Between them, the two programmes have approved  139 projects, representing funding of around &euro;265 million. He reported that in  2009 Peace III had spent &euro;21 million and INTERREG IVa had spent &euro;16 million,  both comfortably above the relevant EU spending targets. As a result of that  expenditure, neither programme will have any of its budget deducted by Brussels.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council noted SEUPB&rsquo;s progress on a number of issues  relating to the Peace III and INTERREG IV programmes. Peace III projects  included efforts to ensure that the needs of victims and survivors of the  terrorist campaign are properly addressed. The Peace III theme of acknowledging  and dealing with the past has a particular focus on victims and survivors. To  date, it has approved 55 projects, representing &euro;23 million in funding.  Ministers emphasised how important it is that that work continues over the  remaining years of the programme and that the direct focus on victims and  survivors is maintained.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Ministers also agreed that it is essential that both  communities participate in the Peace III programme, and they noted and welcomed  the work that SEUPB is doing to encourage applications from the Protestant  community. Research expected towards the end of this year will provide the  first indication of community participation in the Peace III programme. The  Council noted that implementation of the local peace and reconciliation action  plans has begun.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council noted that concerns raised by the five local  authority-based groups regarding the approval of their multiannual plans for  INTERREG IVa are being addressed. Pat Colgan reported to us that individual  projects based on the plans are being progressed through the INTERREG programme  selection procedures. There are 63 such projects across the five groups. Each  will need to demonstrate its relevance to the agreed INTERREG aims and  objectives and to demonstrate value for money in exactly the same way as any  other application for INTERREG funding. It was reported that nine projects that  were submitted by the groups have already been approved for INTERREG funding  and that a further 37 remained under assessment. According to SEUPB&rsquo;s  indicative timetable, all 37 should have their decision &mdash; either way &mdash; by July.  The remaining 17 projects have so far submitted too little information to allow  assessment to begin.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Ministers noted the following key activities and priorities  for SEUPB in 2010: the management and delivery of the 2007-2013 Peace III and  INTERREG programmes, ensuring that all targets are achieved; ensuring that  SEUPB services are delivered efficiently; supporting North/South engagement  with the EU-funded transnational and inter-regional programmes; and ensuring a  successful closure of the Peace II and INTERREG IIIa programmes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council noted that SEUPB had applied efficiency savings  of &pound;262,000 in the 2010 budget. In addition to those savings, SEUPB will reduce  EU programme running costs, mostly for technical assistance, by &euro;2&middot;4 million in  2009 and 2010 and &euro;3&middot;1million for 2011-15. Those savings will enable higher  expenditure on projects.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council approved the 2010 business plan of the SEUPB  and recommended a budget provision for administration costs of &pound;2&middot;254 million  and EU programme expenditure of &pound;67&middot;659 million. The Council aims to meet again  in special EU programmes sectoral format in October 2010.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">The Deputy Chairperson of the  Committee for Finance and Personnel (Mr Weir)</span>: I thank the Minister for  his statement. He mentioned the previous under-representation of applications  from the unionist community. I appreciate that an evaluation of measures taken  will be carried out at a later stage, but will the Minister outline what  proactive measures have been taken to encourage and facilitate greater  representation from the unionist community and to increase the number of  applications from it?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Quite an amount of work has been done. As I said in  the statement, we will not know how effective that has been until the  evaluation of the work has been carried out. There has been direct contact  with, for example, the Orange Order and institutions therein and with community  associations that are representative of and exclusively in the unionist  community. I visited some of the projects that received funding, and we hope to  see an end to the under-representation of the Protestant community in the  applications.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One of the problems has been that fewer applications have  been received from groups in the unionist community than from the nationalist  community. As a result, fewer applications are going through. That is where the  under-representation has occurred. We have been working with those groups.  There has been direct contact with them, and I have received good feedback from  some of the groups that feel that they got a sympathetic hearing and that they  received good advice and guidance on the projects that they are applying for.  At the end of the day, they have to meet the criteria. The more capacity there  is in the unionist/Protestant community, the more effective that work will be.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Finance and Personnel (Ms J McCann)</strong>: Go raibh maith  agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his statement. He will be  aware that the five partnerships raised concerns about INTERREG IVa funding.  Will he assure the House that those five partnerships will still receive the  &euro;60 million for the multi-area plans that they submitted to INTERREG IVa?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: There was some difficulty with the five local  authority partnerships. The first action that we took was to make some changes  to the application process so that the selection criteria are clearer. The  selection criteria have not changed, but we provided clarification on the  information that needs to be provided in support of the applications to enable  them to be processed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Nine applications worth &euro;5&middot;5 million have been received by  the steering committee in respect of which approval has been given and letters  of offer issued. There are 37 applications in the system on which we hope and  expect a decision to be made by July 2010. That does not mean that a positive  decision will be made on them, but they will be assessed by July. There are 17  applications for which insufficient information has been provided and on which  no assessment or final decision can be made.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is no guarantee that all 63 projects will succeed.  However, we are happy that we are working apace to ensure that the money is  spent and spent on time and that the help and clarification that may not have  been there at the start is now available to the groups.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: I  declare an interest as a member of North Down Borough Council. I thank the  Minister for his timely report. Is he aware that the multiagency plans suffered  significant delay largely because of the board&rsquo;s changing advice to the various  councils? Five local authority-based partnerships expressed no confidence in  the programmes body. Is the Minister satisfied that enough has been done to  restore the confidence of the local authorities involved?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The multiannual plans that the local authority-based  groups developed were agreed some time ago. There may have been a  misunderstanding that the multiannual plans were all that was needed, but they  provided too little detail to allow funding decisions to be made. That is one  of the reasons why we have now given clarification and explained the process,  what has to be done and what information has to accompany the applications so  that they can be processed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That message seems to have got through because, as I said  to the Chairperson of the Committee, we have approved nine applications worth  &pound;5&middot;5 million, and there are others in the pipeline that we should approve by  July 2010. I hope that that is an indication that the local authority-based  groups now understand and are doing what has to be done. We are determined to  process applications as quickly as possible.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I met two local authority-based groups and got an  understanding of the difficulties that they face and their misapprehensions  about the multiannual plans. I hope that the issue has been sorted out.  However, it is a complex area, and we do not want to give any money back. If  Members are aware of any difficulties, I want to hear about them so that we can  keep on top of the matter.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  INTERREG IVa, which is overseen by the Department, is progressing well. Having  said that, I do not overlook the concerns that were expressed by the local  authority-based groups, and I am hopeful that they are being addressed  properly. Officials from the SEUPB present themselves extremely well when they  come before the Committee, and they give me a lot of confidence about how the  programmes are being operated. Departmental officials, who also come before the  Committee, also engage well with the programmes. Given the success of INTERREG  IVa, does the Minister, when reading from a wider script, feel that there are  lessons to be learned about the immense benefits that the adoption of an  inter-regional approach can bring for our economy and public service delivery?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I have never made any secret of my belief that,  because we share a land boundary with the Irish Republic,  it makes sense to co-operate, where possible, to bring about a better use of  resources. Any Finance Minister would want to achieve the best value for money  and avoid duplication. Of course, where possible, we should marry plans on one  side of the border with those on the other side of the border to avoid costly  delays and so on.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some of the programmes illustrate that sensible  co-operation can lead to a better delivery of service. I am not saying that  that is true all the time or that INTERREG IVa always represents the best  method of delivery, because there may well be other ways in which that can be  done. However, any sensible person would want plans to be married so that we do  not have unnecessary overlap.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  commend the Minister for fitting in the NSMC meeting in Dublin, given all the long Budget debates  that we had in the Chamber in February. Does the Minister agree that the real  way in which we test the success of the programmes is not by the amount or  efficiency of spend but by the impact of the schemes on the ground? Similarly,  the quality of the projects will not be best measured by examining what side of  the community they come from. If we are genuinely addressing good relations,  the projects, by definition, will embrace both the Protestant and the Catholic  sections of the community.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Let me take the Member&rsquo;s last point first. It is  important that the money is spent as the Member describes within the theme that  is designed to produce a greater understanding. It is valuable to spend it in  that way.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I visited the headquarters of the Orange Order, which has  benefited from some of this money for educational projects. Two points emerged  from that meeting. First, a significant number of Catholic schools are invited  to visit and to have explained to them the Order&rsquo;s background and what the  Order is about. That is designed to try to destroy some of the myths that there  are around the Orange Order and a whole lot of things associated with the  unionist community. If that bears fruit, some of the contention around what  many unionists see as a cultural event but what &mdash; as a result, sometimes, of  the activities of mischievous people &mdash; is seen in the nationalist community as  a bit of political coat-trailing will abate. The money will have been well  spent, for it will have an impact on the security situation and on community relations.  The Orange Order is to be commended for its work, as is SEUPB for the way that  it has financed that. I use that as an illustration, but there are many other  examples and that is just one that I am familiar with from conversations that I  have had in the last couple of weeks.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The other point that the Member made related to impact on  local communities. One of the changes in this funding is that we are now going  for larger projects, some of which will have a more lasting impact and leave a  legacy. People sometimes look back at INTERREG IIIa and Peace II and ask what  has been their long-term effect. I am probably off script here, but I do not  mind. Some of the money could perhaps have been spent more wisely and made a  greater impact. Members are concerned about delays or what they perceive as  delays. However, they must accept that, when we target larger, more complicated  projects, a lot more work is involved in getting them processed and assessed.  There is an up-front cost in that but, in the long term, the benefits are  greater.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McQuillan</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement. What is being done to help the 17  groups that submitted too little information?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: In all cases where groups have submitted too little  information, they are made aware of what information is outstanding. They are  told what has to be done to enable the projects to progress. In some cases, the  reason why too little information has been sent is that the outstanding  information is not there, and the projects may fail at the end of the day.  However, it is not a case of our sending the application back and saying,  &ldquo;Tough. There is not enough information here&rdquo;. It is explained to them what  additional information is needed and what is needed for the process. Hopefully,  then, they will come back. For some of the 37 applications that are currently  being assessed, some additional information was required. That was supplied,  and they are now being processed.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  statement. My question follows on from Adrian&rsquo;s.  We must wait until July to discover how many of the 37 applications being  processed and evaluated will succeed. The Minister referred to efficiency  savings and technical support: will they have a detrimental impact on  applications that have not come up to scratch or not satisfied the criteria?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A matter of more serious concern was not reflected in the  statement, but I would be surprised if it did not arise during the sectoral  meeting. Projects have had to be withdrawn not because they do not satisfy the  criteria or are unable to draw down the European money but because they could  not access, in the current economic downturn, the necessary matching funding.  Has there been any discussion on how to address that problem? The tentacles of  the recession affect all sorts of programmes.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Technical assistance efficiency savings between now  and 2015 should amount to &pound;5 million, all of which will be poured into new  projects. We identified superfluous technical assistance, which means that  savings can be made that will not harm efficiency. The Member is right that  there is no point in making savings only to find that projects cannot go ahead.  We believe that administrative savings can be made, and extra money can be  ploughed into projects.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">(Mr Deputy Speaker <span class="Italic">[Mr Molloy]</span> in the Chair)</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member raised the issue of the financial difficulties  in the Irish Republic, where some Departments had  spent their full capital allocation, resulting in moratoriums being placed on  projects. Peace III funding is offered to Scotland,  Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic,  so there are cross-border elements. If match funding cannot be found, a project  cannot go ahead.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">After discussions with Minister Lenihan, my understanding  is that priority for new capital allocations will be given to projects that are  already in the system. When capital allocations are made to departmental  budgets next year, priority will be given to projects that are in the system or  are required to meet international commitments. Rather than projects being  halted, they will probably be delayed until those capital allocations are made  in the next financial year.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: I  declare my membership of the Committee of the Regions and an SEUPB funding  body.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s positive statement. Will he join  me in welcoming the good stewardship that means that there has been no  reduction in finance from Brussels and that, at  a time of unparalleled recession in Northern   Ireland, Northern    Ireland is receiving direct finance? Will he  ensure that his statement underlines the fact that the direct focus on victims  and survivors, who have suffered so much, is maintained and, if possible,  enhanced? Given that the evidence base shows a lower application rate from the  Protestant community, will the Minister ensure that SEUPB officials continue to  encourage applications from the Protestant community and that they monitor the  effectiveness of that encouragement?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Mr Deputy Speaker, you will have to take that boy  aside and tell him that he is allowed only one question, not three, on  ministerial statements. I will try to answer all three questions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We still need to evaluate whether the efforts that have  been made so far have been effective. At the very least, more applications are  being made, more help is being given and more attention is being paid to the  under-represented section of the community. It remains to be seen what the  outcome will be, but the SEUPB has not pulled back. The Minister for Finance in  the Irish Republic, Brian Lenihan, supports the  issue as much as I do. At the meeting, he emphasised that he wants a more even  spread of money. The pressure comes not only from the unionist side but from  the Irish Republic.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member&rsquo;s second question was on victims and survivors.  I should have the figures some&shy;where in my big black book of answers. However,  I will write to the Member with the precise figure. Peace III money places an  emphasis on victims and survivors, and that will continue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to money&rsquo;s not being returned to Europe, there have been discussions about the N+2 targets  for Peace III and INTERREG IVa. Given that other parts of the EU were not meeting  some of the targets, there was discussion about whether they should be relaxed.  We are meeting those targets, so that does not apply to us. Therefore, there is  no danger of money being lost or sent back to Brussels. If anything, consideration is being  given to changing the targets because other Administrations have failed to  spend the money. However, we are well on target.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: As the Minister said, Members should ask one question.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  I would love to ask the Minister many questions, but I have just one. I declare  an interest as a member of Antrim Borough Council, which is part of the North  East Partnership.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am concerned that the advice and guidelines keep  changing. I know that the Minister said that things are more complex, but will  he consider some form of fast-tracking or dynamism to get the applications that  were mentioned in the statement processed before the end of July, or will we  have to wait until then?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Some things have happened already. Perhaps I did not  make myself clear: the deadline for the receipt of the 37 applications is  between now and the end of July. The steering committee will process some  applications before July, but the deadline to have all 37 processed is the end  of July. I am sorry if I did not make myself clear about that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am interested in what the Member said. I know that people  say that Members of the Assembly should not be members of local councils;  however, the Member illustrated a very important issue in bringing to the  Assembly some knowledge of what happens at local level. If there is still some  confusion about what is required, especially for the local authority groups, I  would like to hear from the Member. As I said, I listened to two of the groups  concerned, and we sought to make the criteria and the selection process much  clearer to them. If there is still contradictory advice, changing rules or  changing selection criteria, I would be more than happy to speak to the Member  or to receive a delegation from his council or the group of councils in which  he is involved so that we can ensure that there is no misunderstanding.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement. Returning to the issue that his party  colleague Mr Bell raised, will the Minister provide to Members or lodge in the  Assembly Library the details of the 55 projects that have been approved under  the theme of acknowledging and dealing with the past? When it comes to funding  those 55 projects and addressing that theme, is the Minister satisfied that the  overall balance of that funding among groups, organisations, communities, and  victims and survivors is appropriate?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: As I am sure the Member knows, I do not have the  details either in my head or in my papers of all the projects that have been  funded. However, there should be transparency in the matter, so I am more than  happy to provide that information. I suspect that the Member was alluding to  the amount of money that goes to ex-prisoner groups as opposed to victims&rsquo;  groups. We should not forget that prisoners&rsquo; groups qualify under all three  themes. Before I took up my position, I was unhappy that the rules that were  set perhaps favoured groups that many people thought should not get such  favourable treatment. Indeed, now that I am in the post, I remain unhappy with  that situation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, the rules have been established, and applications  must be processed on the basis of those rules. I think that we can supply  information on the balance of the groups that have applied, the groups that  have been successful and the total amounts of money awarded.</p>
    <p class="H3SubHeading" style="page-break-before:always;"><a name="4"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Draft Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Bill</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I have received notification from the Minister of the Environment  that he wishes to make a statement.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment (Mr Poots)</strong>: Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. If the Finance  Minister were to move from his position on the Front Bench, I would start, but  with your permission &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel (Mr S Wilson)</strong>: The Minister may regret chasing me  from my seat so quickly if he is looking for money. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: We are not looking for his money on this occasion, Mr  Deputy Speaker.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to make a statement about the draft clean  neighbourhoods and environment Bill, which I issued for public consultation on  1 March. I am delighted to have received Executive clearance to proceed with  the draft Bill, and I appreciate the many supportive comments that I have  received from ministerial colleagues in respect of it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is very important to understand the magnitude of the  draft clean neighbourhoods and environment Bill. It is about much more than the  individual elements of the Bill, important though those elements are. It is  about more than litter, graffiti, fly-posting, noise, nuisance or dog litter.  Although those issues and others addressed in the Bill merit our attention,  taken together, they have a cumulative impact on people and communities that  goes far beyond tidy streets.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">First and foremost, the Bill is about promoting quality of  life by taking care of the environment. Clean neighbourhoods are healthier,  safer and happier neighbourhoods. Litter, noise, nuisance vehicles and  vandalism attract antisocial behaviour, crime, long-term illness and all of the  social problems that have a high cost for communities, the ratepayer and the  taxpayer. That is the context in which the Bill&rsquo;s purpose must be seen and  welcomed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Since the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005 was  introduced by the UK Government in England and Wales in May of that year, my  Department has been receiving calls from many quarters about the introduction  of corresponding legislation in Northern Ireland. MLAs, MPs, district councils,  Tidy Northern Ireland, the Northern Ireland Local Government Association  (NILGA), the chief environmental health officers&rsquo; group and other interested  parties have called for the introduction of clean neighbourhoods legislation in  Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Until now, we have been unable to respond positively to  those calls because of resource pressures. However, following a review, and  despite the challenging financial circumstances that we face across the  Executive, I have made a point of finding the necessary staff resources to look  at the issue. We must now consider the task of how, with the support of  appropriate legislation, we can help district councils in Northern Ireland  to deal more effectively with a range of problems associated with local  environmental quality.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My view, informed by representations from the local  government sector in particular, is that we should aim to provide councils here  with broadly the same powers that their counterparts in England and Wales have under the Clean  Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005. Those powers are important, because  they will enable councils to tackle the issues directly and because they will  allow them to do so in a more streamlined and less resource-intensive way. Used  properly, the powers proposed in the draft Bill should cut red tape and enable  councils to do more with their resources to make a serious impact on the full  range of issues addressed in the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill will address the following issues: litter of all  forms, including, for example, chewing gum litter that blights the appearance  of the footpaths in our towns and cities; cigarettes and other litter that is  casually cast aside; illegal fly-posting and graffiti, which degrade local  environments; and irresponsible dog ownership and dog-fouling, which further  degrade our public spaces and, at best, present an unpleasant hazard for young  and old alike. There are other, no less important issues that affect the  quality of life in our local neighbourhoods, such as noise levels, nuisance or  abandoned vehicles and problems caused by poorly directed domestic artificial  lighting.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill deals with all those matters, which is why I say  that it is important. It deals with a wide range of local environmental quality  issues, and, as a complete package, it is a significant piece of legislation.  However, before seeking to introduce the Bill in the Assembly, I am consulting  on the detailed proposals to ensure that they address our local circumstances  properly. I am grateful to the Environment Committee, which has already  expressed its support for the Bill, for its encouragement to make progress  quickly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In fact, I am not aware of any opposition to the  legislation, which is not surprising. No one wants to live in a neighbourhood  that is affected by a poor-quality local environment. Good local environments  reduce antisocial behaviour and the fear of crime. They attract more investment  and have a positive impact on our health, well-being, confidence and civic  pride, and they help to promote tourism.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I believe that the vast majority of people in Northern Ireland  will accept that the Bill, which is designed to improve the appearance of local  neighbourhoods and enhance our quality of life, is necessary and long overdue.  That is because despite district councils&rsquo; excellent endeavours to tackle the  problems and despite ongoing campaigns that are designed to encourage those who  create the problems to change their ways, those problems cost Northern Ireland  councils millions of pounds to clean up.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Just last month, for example, I joined a local group of  dedicated conservation volunteers and Tidy Northern Ireland to see for myself  the incredible extent of the littering problem in a particular open space; a  space that is by no means unique. What should have been a beautiful and scenic  open space for the local community to enjoy was completely spoiled by excessive  littering. Plastic bags, paper bags, broken glass, empty bottles, used nappies  and crisp packets were clearly visible. In a very short time, we collected more  than 30 black bin bags of litter. One could come up with all kinds of reasons  and excuses for that, but the bottom line is that that sort of mess is not good  enough. People have a right to expect more care and consideration from others  in their community.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In this statement, I cannot cover every detail of the draft  Bill. As Members will appreciate, the legislation is sizeable and complex, and  it contains detailed amendments to several pieces of existing legislation, such  as the Litter (Northern    Ireland) Order 1994. However, I shall  summarise the draft Bill&rsquo;s key provisions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, for many people in Northern Ireland, litter continues  to be a major concern. If left unchecked, litter in all its forms &mdash; such as  chewing gum, cigarette butts, fast food, drink containers and wrapping paper &mdash;  is an eyesore that leads to dirty streets and unhealthy and unsightly local  environments. The Bill will strengthen existing law to enable district councils  to deal more effectively with litter problems. The Bill will amend the offence  of dropping litter in a lake, pond or watercourse; strengthen provisions to  deal with people who fail to provide their name and address; give councils new  powers to require businesses and individuals to clear litter from their land;  strengthen existing powers for councils to require local businesses to help to  clear up litter that they generate; and enable councils to restrict the  distribution of flyers, handouts and pamphlets, which can end up as litter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Fly-posting and graffiti are visual signs of neglect and  degradation in a local environment. Therefore, to enable district councils to  deal more effectively with fly-posting and graffiti, the Bill will strengthen  existing law to give councils the ability to issue fixed-penalty notices to  graffiti and fly-posting offenders; enable councils to serve defacement removal  notices in respect of graffiti and fly-posting; make it an offence to sell  spray paint to children; and make it harder for the beneficiaries of fly-posting  to evade prosecution.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Irresponsible dog ownership gives rise to complaints from  the public, and dog fouling contributes to the spread of harmful infections.  The Bill will introduce new arrangements for controlling dogs by replacing the  local by-law system with a system that is more streamlined, straightforward and  easier for district councils to operate. It will replace dog by-laws with a  new, simplified system of dog control Orders, which will enable councils to  deal with dog fouling; ban dogs from designated areas; require dogs to be kept  on a lead; and restrict the number of dogs that can be walked by one person.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Noise is a form of nuisance that the public still regard as  a major problem. The Bill will give district councils new powers to deal with  audible intruder alarms, and it will extend the provisions of the Noise Act  1996 relating to noise from private premises to cover noise from licensed  premises. Those provisions are designed to deal with noise nuisance problems  that are caused by false alarms when keyholders are away and deal with the  owners of licensed premises who ignore warnings to reduce excessive noise.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The existing statutory nuisance law is 131 years old and,  despite its having been amended from time to time, the definition of what may  be considered a statutory nuisance and the enforcement powers that are  available to district councils have not kept pace with developments in  statutory nuisance legislation applying outside Northern Ireland. The Bill will  update the archaic law on statutory nuisance by bringing it into line with that  which applies in England and  Wales,  as amended by the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Fixed-penalty notices are a simple and visible way in which  to deal with environmental offences. If used properly, they provide an  effective deterrent and avoid the cost of court action. At present,  fixed-penalty notices can be issued for littering and dog-fouling offences and  also for some noise-violation offences. The draft Bill makes greater use of  fixed-penalty notices as an alternative to prosecution and gives councils the  flexibility, subject to upper and lower limits, to set their own fixed rates.  The draft Bill&rsquo;s proposals extend the use of fixed-penalty notices for offences  relating to nuisance and abandoned vehicles, litter controls, other dog  controls and additional noise controls.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Back alleys and entries can attract a range of antisocial  and environmental problems that reduce the quality of life in our local  neighbourhoods. They can be magnets for litter, fly-tipping, abandoned vehicles  and graffiti. They can increase the risk of domestic burglary and provide cover  for those engaged in drug dealing, and, as a result, they can make the lives of  local residents a misery. The Bill will contain proposals to make the existing  procedure for closing off nuisance back alleys more effective. The Bill will  contain amendments to the Roads (Northern Ireland) Order 1993 to  give effect to gating order provisions. The Bill will give councils new powers,  with the Department for Regional Development&rsquo;s approval, to make gating orders  to deal with problem alleyways. The Minister for Regional Development has  policy responsibility for the legislation and agrees with the proposals.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill will give councils new powers to deal with  businesses that sell or repair cars on the road. Such parked vehicles can be a  nuisance. They can reduce parking opportunities and cause pollution; for  example, where oil has spilled or leaked. Two new offences will be created:  offering for sale two or more vehicles; and repairing a vehicle on the road as  part of a business. Abandoned cars degrade streets and can become targets for  antisocial behaviour and arson. The Bill will give councils the power to remove  abandoned cars from streets immediately.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Abandoned trolleys can be a visible problem and a hazard,  and when dumped in watercourses, they can cause a range of problems that may  harm wildlife. The Bill will give councils the power to recover the costs of  retrieving abandoned shopping trolleys from the trolleys&rsquo; owners.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The draft Bill increases the maximum fine, from &pound;30,000 to  &pound;50,000, on summary conviction that may be provided for in regulations made  under pollution prevention and control provisions in the Environment (Northern Ireland)  Order 2002. That will enable maximum fines on summary conviction in the  Pollution Prevention and Control Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2003 &mdash;  concerning, for example, contravention of the requirement for a permit to  operate an installation or mobile plant; failure to comply with, or to  contravene, a condition of a permit; and failure to comply with the  requirements of an enforcement notice or a suspension notice &mdash; to be brought  into line with the equivalent maximum fines for illegal waste activity that are  set out in the Waste and Contaminated Land (Northern Ireland) Order 1997, in  order to ensure consistency. The increase to &pound;50,000 will also bring the level  of fine into line with that which applies in England  and Wales.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Minister of the Environment, I deal with many large-scale  environmental issues daily. Major challenges, such as waste management, air  quality, climate change, water quality, marine planning and built heritage are  all very important, and my Department&rsquo;s work is rightly targeted at alleviating  major environmental concerns in those areas. However, it is clear to me,  through my work as a local councillor, and more so since I became Minister of  the Environment, how important the state and appearance of our local  neighbourhoods and public spaces are to most people in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">People want to live in areas that are clean and safe, and  free from antisocial behaviour and the fear of crime. That is people&rsquo;s number one  priority, and it must also be ours. Therefore, I am sure that Members will  agree that the draft Bill is a very welcome development and will wish to see it  enacted as quickly as possible to help bring about cleaner neighbourhoods for  all our local communities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The consultation period runs from 1 March to 23 April, and  the consultation document may be viewed on, and downloaded from, the Department  of the Environment website.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for the Environment (Mrs D Kelly)</strong>: If it is the guidance  of the Chair that I need to declare an interest as a member of a local council,  I hereby declare. The Minister is right: this will be welcomed across the 26  council areas. In fact, my party colleague Alasdair McDonnell was going to  bring it forward as a private Member&rsquo;s Bill, and he is grateful to the Minister  for bringing forward this legislation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">What are the timescales for the implementation of the  amendments that relate to alley-gating? Will they be carried out in parallel?  The Minister is right in saying that alley-gating is a major concern. Alleyways  are a haven for antisocial behaviour, and there is an increased risk of  domestic burglaries for people who live close to alley gates. Members of the  community are also concerned about the proliferation of illegal flags flying  from lampposts, and about kerb painting. Will the Minister, in consultation  with the Regional Development Minister, bring forward any amendments in  relation to those eyesores?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: A number of orders have been made by the Department for  Regional Development (DRD) as a result of the Belfast alley-gating pilot project. An  independent evaluation of that scheme indicated that it has been effective in  addressing crime, fear of crime and antisocial behaviour in those areas, and  that it has led to increased requests for alley-gating to be extended to other  areas. However, the existing regime for making gating orders has proved to be  cumbersome, and it is felt that a more streamlined approach is required. It was  also felt that responsibility for making gating orders would be better placed  with local government, rather than central government, although it is proposed  that district councils will need the approval of DRD to make or vary a gating  order. That is positive news on that issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill is similar to what has been produced in England and Wales. I suspect that flags, the  painting of kerbs and so forth are not such issues there, so I look forward to  seeing what the Committee brings forward on those issues.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  join other Members in welcoming the proposals; the Bill will be of great  benefit to people across Northern    Ireland. Will the Bill be self-sufficient  with regard to costings, or will it end up with a certain level of charge? I  know that the consultation is due to run until 23 April, but what does the  Minister see as being the timescale for the legislation itself?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: There are a number of ways of dealing with costs. Litter  is a district council issue, as is the legislation that deals with dog fouling,  etc. What we are doing is enhancing the powers of councils to ensure that they  can carry out that work more effectively. A lot of these powers have already  been vested in local authorities. A number of the issues that have been  mentioned today are issues on which councils have a degree of discretion in how  their money is spent. It is important that the fines that are levied go back to  local authorities. If councils set up an effective and tough regime, they will,  therefore, benefit in two ways. First, they will have considerably cleaner  neighbourhoods, which I think the local community will appreciate; and  secondly, they will bring in a degree of income from those individuals who will  not learn and who will not co-operate in keeping their areas as clean as they  should.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Before I call the next Member, I remind Members that they are to  ask a question on the Minister&rsquo;s statement, not to make another statement.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s  statement. Is it the intention of the Bill to provide resources to residents&rsquo;  groups or local community groups to assist them in keeping their neighbourhoods  clean and tidy? There is a case and a need for alley-gating, but some alleys  are walkways, and there does not seem to be proper consultation in that  respect; consultation is, generally, held in specific areas. Is there any  provision to expand the consultation in relation to alley-gating?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I have indicated that litter is the responsibility of  local authorities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is up to local authorities to identify best practice schemes  to ensure that local neighbourhoods are kept clean and tidy and to institute a  regime in which people who do not co-operate are punished.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Giving local authorities the powers to deal with and to  introduce alley-gating, in consultation with DRD, brings the matter to a much  more local level. Local councillors are generally far more accountable in  dealing with such issues and identifying a community&rsquo;s needs than &mdash; with no  disrespect &mdash; a Roads Service official.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">1.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I,  too, declare an interest as a local councillor. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s  decision to overturn his predecessors&rsquo; decision not to progress with this legislation.  Will he advise the House why it has taken five years since the legislation was  introduced successfully in England  for it to be introduced in Northern    Ireland? Why has it taken so long for it to  be prioritised here and for the necessary resources and commitment to be found  to introduce it?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Of course, during a number of those years, there was  direct rule. When this Assembly came into being, Ministers had to bring forward  various pressing issues. Considerable work was done on planning reform, for  example. Does the Member suggest that a clean neighbourhoods and environment  Bill is more important than planning reform, the Wildlife and Natural  Environment Bill or PPS 21? I am not saying that it is less important. However,  I am not sure whether the Member is saying that it is more important.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Ministers have to prioritise a wide range of issues. When I  came into office, I looked at this issue and was aware that there was  considerable pressure to bring it forward. I decided that I would find the  necessary resources to do so. It is not as though other Ministers decided not  to do that; resources were not available to do it. I decided to identify and  take resources from other areas to allow that to happen.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: I  welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comprehensive and progressive statement. I want to ask  him specifically about graffiti and fly-posting, which are the scourge of my  Strangford constituency. Will he assure the House that those measures will be  effective and that their effectiveness will be monitored in order to ensure  that the blight of graffiti and fly-posting in Strangford is brought to an end?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: District councils indicate that existing legislation needs  to be strengthened. I propose to do that by giving councils power to issue  fixed-penalty notices in respect of certain fly-posting and graffiti offences,  to issue defacement removal notices and to recover costs from the person on  whom a notice is served. I propose to make it an offence to sell aerosol spray  paint to a person who is under 16 years of age. Other changes that are being  made enable councils to seek the removal of illegally displayed posters or  placards by the people who displayed them or caused them to be displayed and  make it easier for councils to remove posters or placards if necessary and to  recover the cost of doing so.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One problem with the current legislation is that, if an  advertisement for a certain nightclub, circus or event is illegally displayed,  a council must prove that that person had given his or her approval for that  advertisement to be displayed in the first instance. It is easy for people to  get out of that. As a result of the new legislation, the burden of proof will  change considerably. Individuals will have to prove that they took all  reasonable measures to ensure that they did not act in defiance of the  legislation. That could, potentially, have huge impact, particularly on the  fly-posting that is often seen on our streets.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: On  a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I declare that I am a member of Ards  Borough Council.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I also declare an interest as a  member of Ballymoney Borough Council. I welcome the proposals on fly-posting.  Fly-posting for concerts and other major social events is a common problem in  my community. Does the Minister believe that there are alternative, affordable  ways in which some organisations that are currently involved in fly-posting  could advertise events publicly without degrading an area or making it look  untidy?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I am surprised that an old boy like me should have to  educate someone who is relatively young on the opportunities that are available  in communication nowadays &mdash; for example, various websites, such as Facebook,  Twitter and so on. There are huge opportunities to spread the message,  particularly for concerts and such events.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his state&shy;ment, which I welcome. I declare an interest  as a councillor in the south Antrim area. Like others, I long to see a tidier Northern Ireland.  If I may make one little statement, I congratulate everyone who has helped to  pick up litter throughout Northern    Ireland, whether they are members of the  public, councillors or Ministers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">How will the Bill deal with councils that have to work  together? For example, rubbish from various council areas gathers at the south  Antrim corner of Lough Neagh and will need to be dealt with jointly. How will  that be managed and financed?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: That ties in with my vision for local government in the  future: there must be greater collaboration among local councils. There must be  greater connectivity among councils, and they must work together in the best  and wider interests of the public. That might involve cost-saving measures by  councils to ensure that rates are kept low or ensuring that the environment in  which we live is kept in the pristine condition that the public want. We will  seek to encourage, persuade, cajole and, on occasions, legislate for that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  I thank the Minister for getting us this far. I am concerned about a range of  these issues, and I congratulate him on what he has done. The Minister  mentioned nuisance parking and abandoned vehicles. I am worried that &ldquo;abandoned  vehicles&rdquo; refers only to vehicles on the roads. I am just as concerned about  vehicles abandoned adjacent to a road, near a road or on a public space other  than a road. It is important that abandoned vehicles are not allowed to be left  on any public space.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, if I might indulge myself, the Minister made no  mention of hedges. High hedges and wide hedges are a serious issue. As a holy &mdash;  or religious &mdash; person, I hate nothing more than the slap of a wet branch as I  make my way to church on a Sunday morning. I believe that it is the Minister&rsquo;s  responsibility to ensure that that problem is avoided.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I return the Member&rsquo;s tribute. He was one of those who  pressed this issue and sought to have the legislation introduced. It is good to  see that the Assembly can work on a cross-party and a cross-community basis and  that it is not as dysfunctional as some people make it out to be. We can work  and co-operate with one another in the best interests of the public of Northern Ireland.  Therefore, I pay tribute to Dr McDonnell for bringing this matter to my  attention and for urging me to bring forward measures. That is one of the  reasons why we are where we are today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The requirement to give notice to the occupier of the land  on which a vehicle has been abandoned will be removed. That will include  private roads that pass through housing estates that are managed by registered  social landlords as well as other housing estates, and it will, effectively,  enable vehicles to be removed immediately from any road to which the public  have access. When an abandoned vehicle is fit only for destruction, a district  council will no longer be required to affix a notice to the vehicle prior to  its removal, such as a van in Custom    House Square, and will be able to remove it  immediately.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The rules on the disposal of abandoned vehicles will be  simplified. Councils will no longer have to wait for the vehicle licence to  expire before disposing of the vehicle. Abandoned vehicles that are fit only  for destruction can be destroyed immediately, and vehicles that do not display  a licence or number plate can be disposed of immediately. In all other cases,  district councils will have to try to find the owner. If they are unable to  find the owner or if the owner does not collect the vehicle within seven days  of being contacted, it can be disposed of.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Similar amendments will be made to the road traffic  regulations, which give powers to constables and the Department for Regional  Development (DRD) to deal with abandoned vehicles. The aim of those changes is  to provide a more efficient way to clear abandoned vehicles from streets and  reduce the instances of antisocial behaviour, such as vandalism and arson,  which such vehicles can attract. This will also reduce the additional storage  costs incurred by district councils while waiting for the expiration of the  licence; where a vehicle is fit only for destruction; or where the owner cannot  be traced or has chosen not to collect it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As regards nuisance hedges, if the Member is saying that  hedges are growing over the footpaths where he walks, that matter can be dealt  with by the DRD. If a hedge is growing over a footway or road, the DRD has the  powers to instruct the owner of the hedge to cut it back. The high hedges  legislation is separate and is going through the House. We are bringing forward  that new legislation because the community in Northern Ireland wants it to be  introduced. We are doing that in the community&rsquo;s best interests.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I fully support and welcome the statement that the Minister has made. I think  he will agree that, although his is the lead Department, this is a  cross-departmental issue. He has just mentioned the DRD. Does he agree that  education has an important role to play in that youngsters coming through the  school system should be educated not to be litter louts when they grow up?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to make two points; I know that the Minister could  not have included them all in the statement. It is going to be difficult for  councils to &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member must ask a question.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  &mdash; to catch the people who drive along in their car and fire out a bag full of  stuff from a fast food outlet. The litter lying along our foreshores is also a  disgrace. When the legislation is implemented &mdash; I do not know when that will be  &mdash; will the Minister be able to monitor whether the position has been greatly  enhanced six months or a year later by the legislation that we all welcome this  morning?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Unless Big Brother is at every telegraph pole, we will not  catch every individual who tosses litter out of their car. Nonetheless,  community responsibility should mean that, when people see someone throwing  litter out of a car, they should take the car number and pass it on to the  local authorities and allow them to deal with it. These individuals are  despoiling our countryside and should be punished for doing so.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member is right to say that it needs to be instilled in  our young people from the earliest age that it is wrong to drop litter, throw  litter out of cars or spit chewing gum out on the streets. All those things  detract from the environment that they and, at some point, their children will  grow up in and take away from the healthy well-being and the good environment  that young people need to grow up in. Education needs to continue. Our job is  to enhance the legislation to deal with the people who refuse to be educated.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  I congratulate the Minister on bringing the consultation forward. There is no  doubt that since he has become Minister his priority has been to bring forward  legislation that deals with local issues. As regards fly-posting, posters are  placed by church-based and charity-based organisations. Will those organisations  be given a time exemption to remove their posters after an event, rather than  having them removed as soon as they go up?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: We want to stop fly-posters going up all over the place.  We want to stop posters being pasted to telegraph poles and bridges, where a  lot of vehicles pass, and then abandoned. If people want to advertise  particular events in a responsible way, I want my Department and other  Departments to co-operate with them. Some people are pasting up posters in a  most irresponsible way and are leaving the mess for someone else to clean up.  That is wholly unacceptable.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">1.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  As other Members have done, I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. What financial  implications does he envisage? Undoubtedly, those will be quite significant for  local authorities. Does he expect that local authorities will have to absorb  the costs, or will extra provision be made? Does the Minister anticipate that  the Bill will require local authorities to be proactive in fulfilling their new  commitments, or will that be a reactive requirement?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: It is in the interests of local government to be  proactive. At some point, we could consider creating an index that would show  how clean an area is and identify the local authorities across Northern Ireland  that are being proactive in dealing with litter, deposits of chewing gum on the  streets and graffiti. Such a measure would show up the councils that are not  being as proactive as they should be.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have discussed with Minister Ritchie and Minister Wilson  the potential for introducing business improvement districts (BIDs). BID  funding would be attractive to local authorities, particularly in the  townscapes. Local businesses would pay a modest supplement to their rates, but,  in return, they would get a considerably cleaner and graffiti-free environment.  That could bring additional money to local authorities. Additional money will  come through higher fines and, hopefully, the easier enforcement of those  fines. I do not expect that the resource that is being asked of councils will  be particularly cost-intensive. Where it is properly implemented, it will be  hugely beneficial to local authorities at a modest cost.</p>

    <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="6"></a>Housing: Savills Report</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30  minutes for the debate. The proposer will have 10 minutes to propose the motion  and 10 minutes in which to make a winding-up speech. All other Members who are  called to speak will have five minutes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Social Development (Mr Hamilton)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly notes the findings of the Savills report;  calls on the Minister for Social Development to ensure equity in the delivery  of new social housing and the maintenance of existing Housing Executive stock;  and further calls on the Minister to limit the reduction in funding for Housing  Executive maintenance contractors, in view of the adverse economic situation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At the Committee&rsquo;s meeting of 25 February 2009, it was  agreed that this motion on the Savills report should be tabled for debate in  the House. It is only the second Social Development Committee motion of the  current mandate, and, similar to our motion of June 2009, it reflects the  Committee&rsquo;s concerns about maintaining and improving social housing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The challenges that the Department for Social Development  faces in funding social housing have been well set out by the Minister and by  others on a number of occasions. Although that is important, recent debate on  the subject has been characterised by some as tired and the arguments as rather  worn. The Committee, therefore, noted with great interest the findings of the  Savills report, which the Minister referenced during her response to the  Committee motion on 22 June 2009. The Committee looked forward to the  publication of the Savills report as a way of injecting new ideas and  reinvigorating the necessary and important debate on social housing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee was disappointed that the Department did not  make the Savills report available despite repeated requests. However, I am pleased  to say that, after further correspondence, the Department subsequently agreed  to bring the Savills report to the Committee. The Committee for Social  Development is, therefore, happy to have the opportunity of this debate to air  many important questions in the House.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members may ask what the Savills report is about &mdash; it  is not to be confused with something else that bears the name &ldquo;Saville&rdquo; &mdash; so I  will tell the House about it briefly. The Savills report refers to the housing  stock that the Housing Executive owns. The report was based on a large sample &mdash;  some 9,000 &mdash; of Housing Executive homes, which is equivalent to about 10% of  the overall stock that the Housing Executive possesses. Savills found that the  housing stock was generally of very good quality. In fact, in the round, the  Housing Executive stock probably represents the best social housing that  Savills has reviewed in the whole of the United Kingdom. It is estimated  that around 17% of Housing Executive homes do not meet the decent homes  standard. In comparison with the housing stock of other social landlords, that  is a remarkable claim and one that is worthy of note by the House. That said,  members of the Committee took issue with that part of the report. Members  highlighted examples of homes in their constituencies that were in severe  disrepair and said that they found it difficult to reconcile those with the  report&rsquo;s findings. However, the Committee will give that issue further serious  consideration and will feed back more detail on it to the Department shortly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Savills report suggested that the Housing Executive had  achieved a quality of stock maintenance that exceeded even the decent homes  plus standard and that it had done so while keeping procurement costs at levels  that compared well when benchmarked with the rest of the UK.  Notwithstanding the Committee&rsquo;s concerns that I mentioned earlier, that is an  achievement that deserves much praise.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Savills further characterised the Housing Executive stock  by identifying groups of properties that required significantly more  maintenance and improvement than was currently provided by the single-element  works that Egan contractors have undertaken. That characterisation showed that  the difference between improvement costs and rental income was quite  significant. It also illustrated how pockets of housing that amounted to  several thousand so-called poor- and very poor-performing homes will certainly  need significant improvements now or in the not too distant future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee recognises that there are, of course, major  social housing budget challenges in respect of capital works for existing stock  and building new homes. The Committee, therefore, calls on the Minister to  address those challenges as equitably as she can. The Committee has spent a lot  of time considering the equitable distribution of new homes built under the  social housing development programme. It is, of course, vital that fairness and  equality be maintained in the allocation process for new and existing homes.  Additionally, the Committee suggested that there must be equity in the balance  that is struck between capital improvements and the development of new homes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Savills&rsquo; findings, of which there were many, may be  interpreted in many different ways. It is possible that the proposed  curtailment of Housing Executive capital works may disadvantage certain  communities. A departmental investment strategy that is entirely weighted  towards new social housing may not benefit those communities. The issue of  equity is complex and does not appear to have been considered by Savills. The  Committee believes that further study is required on the equality implications  of the Savills report, and I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s response to that  point today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Having spoken about information, quality and equity, I turn  to the issue of money, to which we tend to revert at some stage in debates such  as this. How big are the proposed reductions to capital expenditure for poorer  Housing Executive stock? The Savills report appears to suggest that a reduction  of some &pound;40 million should be made immediately. In light of that figure, the  House can expect to hear today from Members from across Northern Ireland  who are worried about delayed or cancelled Housing Executive capital works  projects in their area. From Dunclug to New Lodge and from Bangor to Banbridge, the message of concern  will be the same. Those projects can have a hugely favourable impact by helping  communities to rebuild and regenerate areas and turn them around. Aside from  the impact on tenants living in poorer accommodation, a reduction of around &pound;40  million in capital works expenditure will surely have a detrimental effect on  the construction industry in Northern    Ireland. Indeed, the Department estimates  that every &pound;1 million of investment protects 30 jobs in the construction  industry, including its suppliers. Therefore, even using the Department&rsquo;s  figures, the suggested cutbacks could endanger perhaps as many as 1,200 jobs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee recognises that many of these difficult  decisions reflect the loss of capital receipts owing to the contraction of the  housing market. Nonetheless, the Committee urges the Minister to reconsider the  significant changes to the Housing Executive capital works budget so as to  limit the ill effects for tenants in run-down estates and the impact on our  beleaguered construction industry.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Savills report included suggestions relating to  above-inflation increases in Housing Executive rents over a sustained period.  The Committee considered proposals for the establishment of an independent body,  free from political interference, to set fair social rents and other related  charges. The Committee believes that further study is required on that so as to  ensure that any rent regime does not disadvantage the working poor. On behalf  of the Committee, I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s proposed review of social rents and  invite her to set out the relevant terms of reference for that today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee was deeply disappointed by the Department&rsquo;s  apparent initial reluctance to share the Savills report and the Ford report  with the Committee. The latter document would facilitate an informed debate on  the contentious issue of social rent convergence. I again repeat the  Committee&rsquo;s long-standing request that the Ford report be placed in the public  domain to allow for scrutiny by the Committee and debate in the House.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I look forward to hearing Members&rsquo; contributions and, in  particular, the Minister&rsquo;s response to the debate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I take one hat off and put my DUP MLA hat on. The DUP, as a  party, wants to underline its belief in the need for equity and balance in the  funding of social housing newbuild and capital maintenance works, including the  works that I have outlined. We echo the Committee&rsquo;s view that sensitivity and  sympathy must be shown to the construction industry in the handling of any  curtailment of funding for capital works programmes. From experiences in our  constituencies, we all know just how difficult the downturn has been in Northern Ireland,  in particular for the construction industry. Indeed, one reason why Northern Ireland  has suffered is the impact that there has been on the construction industry.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I stress the issue of equality and, if there is a  curtailment of funding for capital works programmes, the need for a proper  assessment of precisely where that will hit. Looking at the extracts from the  Savills report that deal with poor- and very poor-performing houses, Members  will quickly come to the conclusion that, although the list includes housing in  all parts of Northern Ireland with no favour one way or the other, the majority  of homes listed are in what may be deemed Protestant, unionist or loyalist  areas.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As others call for a fair and equitable distribution of  social housing newbuild, I call on the Minister to be mindful and careful in  dealing with any possible curtailment of funding and precisely where that will  impact hardest. Some of the houses listed are in areas that I know which are  run-down and in need of urgent regeneration. Perhaps my colleagues will be  better able to speak from personal experience about areas that they know.  Although there may be a need for significant investment, we cannot allow those  areas to continue to degrade in the way that they have in the past. I urge the  Minister to be careful in considering where and upon whom the impact of  curtailment of funding would be most severe.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member should bring his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Social Development</strong>: On behalf of the DUP, I have no  qualms in supporting the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. In September 2008, the Department  commissioned Savills to undertake a stock condition survey of Housing Executive  housing stock and to provide information on its maintenance investment strategy  and asset planning. The objectives were to support strategic planning for  Housing Executive stock; to enable the best use of resources in effecting the  repair, maintenance and improvement of Housing Executive stock; to provide  information to enable the achievement of the decent homes standard within a  future five-year business plan; and to inform the evaluation of maintenance and  improvement planning in Housing Executive stock over a 30-year term.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The report includes a comparison of Housing Executive stock  with the decent homes plus standard, which is defined as a house complying with  statutory minimum requirements; being in a reasonable state of repair; having  reasonably modern facilities; having a reasonable degree of thermal comfort;  and having its kitchens and bathrooms replaced when required.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">1.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The social rented sector in the North comprises  approximately 114,400 dwellings, 90,000 of which are owned and managed by the  Housing Executive. Savills surveyed a representative sample of 10% of the  existing Housing Executive stock across different property types, ages and  locations, and its report concluded that the quality of the Housing Executive&rsquo;s  stock was very good and was among the best that it had inspected. The Minister,  for her part, stated that the report will allow her:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;to direct capital and revenue resources to ensure we  get the best value regarding the repair, maintenance and improvement of the  homes.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">However, the survey also found that approximately 17%  of Housing Executive stock failed the decent homes plus standard. The most  significant reason for failure was thermal inefficiency, which is directly  attributable to inefficient heating systems. Interestingly, we are to have a  debate later on the proposed introduction of a boiler scrappage scheme, which  could have some impact on that finding.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The secret of maintaining existing housing stock to a  proper level is planned and effective maintenance. Savills recommended that the  Housing Executive adopts a 30-year business plan model, which should be  associated with the costs of meeting and maintaining properties to the decent  homes plus standard. According to Savills, expenditure should be relatively low  during the next five years because of the good condition of the existing  housing stock, but will increase as time goes on and the housing stock gets  older. If the Housing Executive continues to maintain its housing stock  properly, overall costs will logically decrease. The report suggests that the  Executive should focus on areas that must be maintained and not necessarily on  multi-element improvements. However, disabled facilities, such as ramps, must  not be jeopardised in that plan. The reduction in expenditure will also have an  impact on the existing Egan framework partnership contracts, and will  inevitably impact on jobs in the construction industry as it is reliant on work  from the Housing Executive.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There must be some reservations to the Savills report. It  suggests raising NIHE rents, which will impact on those low-income households  that rely on social housing. Also, the report must not be used as an excuse for  cutting essential maintenance but should be utilised for the purpose of  maintaining homes to an existing standard, and those standards must not be  allowed to fall. Equality in the delivery of social housing and maintenance  should be the key.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burns</strong>: I  welcome the opportunity to say a few words on the Savills report and on other  issues mentioned in the motion. I am sure that all Members will agree that  those are very important matters.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As was previously stated, the findings of the Savills  report were presented to the Committee for Social Development in February. The  Chair&shy;person of the Committee and others outlined those findings very well to  the House today, and I will not spend too much time going over the fine detail  of the report. However, it is worth stating that the report concludes:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The NIHE stock is by far the best quality housing  stock that we have inspected. NIHE has maintained the stock to a high standard  and the work undertaken has been completed to a high quality.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That is quite a good report in anyone&rsquo;s book, and we should  pay tribute to the Minister for Social Development, her predecessors and the  Housing Executive for their dedication and hard work. We should also be  grateful that so much money and hard work has been invested in maintaining our  public housing stock.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some shortfalls were highlighted in the report, the main  one being that a sizeable minority of 17% of houses fell below the decent homes  plus standard, which was mainly as a result of poor heating or insulation.  Every Member would agree that the warm homes scheme is the proper way to  address that issue and that it has done a good job so far. Some Members have  been critical of that scheme in recent debates, but it is a scheme that the  Minister and I support 100%.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The main substance of the motion highlights the issue of  newbuild housing versus maintenance and repairs. The Assembly has had many  debates on that issue in various forms. In an ideal world, we would build new  houses and upgrade the existing stock to the highest possible standard.  However, as the money is simply not available for everything, newbuild housing  is the priority. We have debated the matter countless times, and newbuild  social housing is one of the best ways to give the local economy and the construction  industry the help that they need.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The experts do not state that the best way to kick-start  the economy and lift us out of recession is to install kitchens, paint fences,  plant trees or build roads. Although there is no doubt that winning contracts  for such work helps local firms, newbuild social housing is the best way  forward. All Members have seen the report for themselves and have read that  newbuild housing achieves better value for money and a greater economic  multiplying effect, so it must be the priority. If anything, the Savills report  adds further weight to that argument. The report states that the majority of  public housing stock is in &ldquo;excellent&rdquo; condition.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not suggest that all maintenance, upgrades and repairs  should stop. Many houses still require such work, on which DSD spends millions  and millions of pounds each year. However, I repeat that the time is right to  prioritise newbuilds. I accept that such an approach would have a negative  impact on the Egan contractors, but they know that, in any one year, there is  no guarantee of a certain volume of work. However, people who live in Housing  Executive houses should know that money will always be available for home  maintenance on which, this year alone, some &pound;170 million was spent.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I say to those DUP Members who spoke today that, in recent  days in the House and in the media, the Finance Minister, Mr Wilson, issued a  public challenge to the Minister for Social Development.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member should bring his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burns</strong>: He  challenged her to read, review and carefully evaluate all the evidence and  advice that is received to ensure that value for money is achieved and no  resources are wasted. That is exactly what the Minister for Social Development  is doing.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Armstrong</strong>:  It is worth highlighting two statistics from the Savills report: some 17% of  Housing Executive stock, which equates to about 15,000 homes, fall below the  decent homes plus standard, and 31,500 homes in the Housing Executive stock  cost more to maintain than is made from their rental income. The figure of  31,500 represents a massive proportion of that stock, and, in the long term,  that must be investigated by the Minister and the Executive. It is not  sustainable, or at least it should not be considered as such, because it is a  huge drain on the Department&rsquo;s resources and affects the ability of the Housing  Executive to reduce housing pressure.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the principles that people should have decent  homes and resources should be available to contractors to enable them to get  homes up to the standard required. A strategic examination of the stock is  required, with a view to finding a new way to fix it. However, the problem that  is faced at every turn is a lack of money.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly is superb at pointing out the problems and  demanding action by a Minister or a Department. We are great at highlighting  problems and saying that something must be done, but we are, unfortunately, not  as good at coming up with workable solutions. All Ministers in the Executive  would say that with more resources, in the form of money to throw at problems  or more staff, they could tackle the problems that face their Departments. As  we all know, in the current economic climate, more money is not forthcoming,  and, therefore, what is required is a redoubling of efforts to ensure that the  scarce and precious resources are deployed as effectively as possible. That  will require a strategic look at the public finances, with a view to solving  the problems that we face in that area.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a problem with the Housing Executive stock.  However, there is also a problem with the public finances, which restricts the  ability of the Minister to achieve what we want, and no doubt what she wants,  in the short term.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, the problem is not a short-term one; it is a  long-term one that requires a radical solution. I hope that the Minister is  considering how she might solve the problem, because doing so would go a long  way to achieving efficiency savings in her Department. Although those savings  might not be made in the CSR period, they are savings that the Department could  be required to make.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The waste in DSD that the report highlights is not the  Minister&rsquo;s fault, but it would be to her long-term credit if she could do  something about it. That, more than the much needed additional funding, is  perhaps a more realistic prospect.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: I  support the motion and welcome the report.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Savills stock condition survey was the first  independent survey undertaken in Northern Ireland to assess requirements for  maintenance investment and asset planning in social housing in light of budget  restrictions that the Department will face over the coming years. I commend the  Department for taking on that initiative as part of its forward planning.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The report found that Housing Executive homes are in a  better condition than their counterparts elsewhere in the UK. The report stated  that our housing stock was:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;by far the best quality housing stock that we have  inspected.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is something that we should be proud of, and I  commend the Housing Executive for that excellent achievement. The quality of  our housing stock is obviously a result of properly resourcing maintenance  work.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The total cost of maintaining all 90,000 Housing Executive  properties over the next 30 years is estimated to be &pound;5&middot;1 million; &pound;1,887 each  year for every property. The survey estimated that only 15,000 Housing  Executive homes did not comply with the decent homes plus standard; about  11,000 of those homes failed due to inefficient heating systems. During an  evidence session to the Committee, I was pleased that since the report&rsquo;s  publication, thousands of central-heating upgrades or replacements had been  undertaken in Housing Executive homes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In previous years, the Housing Executive spent about &pound;200  million on property maintenance. In the current financial year, that has come  down to about &pound;170 million. The Savills report stated that that could come down  to about &pound;134 million if the Housing Executive focuses on areas that need to be  maintained rather than carrying out multi-element improvement work, as was done  in the past.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If the Housing Executive adopts the proposed cost profile,  as recommended, there will be an impact on the existing Egan framework, as the  Egan contractors are heavily reliant on Housing Executive work to sustain their  businesses. Withdrawing a proportion of that work could affect the viability of  many contractors, particularly during the economic downturn. The Housing  Executive faces a difficult balancing act.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  There have been a number of debates on the Egan contracts in the Chamber.  During the course of those debates, we found out that there are also hundreds  of other small contractors who employ three and four people and who rely  heavily on maintenance contracts to survive. Any reduction in those contracts,  whether they are for the replacement of kitchens or something else, will have a  detrimental effect on many communities. Does the Member agree?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member has another minute in which to speak.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: I  agree with the Member and thank him for his intervention.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, the Minister faces a difficult balancing act, as  does the Department, which faces a shortfall of &pound;100 million or more per annum  over the next few years. However, it is important to bear in mind that we cannot  be complacent with our well-maintained stock for ever. Adequate maintenance of  the housing stock will save us money in the long run and will enable us to  avoid the necessity of knocking down properties and rebuilding them, which is  what we are seeing in the Village area of south Belfast now.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">1.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Instead of cutting expenditure, we perhaps need to consider  increasing our income to maintain the same level of output. Savills found that  since 2007, rent levels in proportion to earnings in Northern Ireland have  fallen behind those in the rest of the UK. He estimated that the maintenance  costs for around 31,000 Housing Executive homes, which is one third of our  stock, will exceed the rental income over a 30-year period. It is clear that  that is not sustainable. We need an independent body that has no political  influence to set a realistic level for social rent in Northern Ireland that is  in line with that in Britain. Over 80% of rent is paid by the Treasury through  housing benefits anyway, and, therefore, the proposal will not negatively  impact on the majority of our tenants.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The report also indicated that the Housing Executive  undertakes environmental and security works, such as ground maintenance and  fencing, that are considered to be outside its landlord functions and that are  the responsibility of local authorities in Great Britain. We should take up  Savills&rsquo;s recommendation to agree with other bodies a joint funding mechanism  to share the costs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Savills highlighted the difficulties with the Housing  Executive&rsquo;s redevelopment of properties. Those difficulties are due partly to  interface issues. That is further evidence of the cost of division, and we can  only hope that, under the new community relations strategy &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: &mdash; and  the strategy for cohesion, sharing and integration, the Department will have a  strategic direction &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Member to bring her remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: &mdash; in  tackling housing segregation in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>: I  welcome the opportunity to speak in support of the motion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I admit that I have a number of concerns about the Savills  report. If we are to meet the decent homes standards, the report estimates that  we need to spend about &pound;157 million a year over the next 30 years. That spend  is against the current estimate of &pound;200 million a year. When I look at the  existing maintenance budget but then see an estimated reduction of more than  &pound;40 million, I must admit that I have difficulty working out where we will find  the necessary balance between newbuilds and maintenance. Other Members talked  about how essential newbuilds are. I do not disagree with that assertion, but  we must find the balance between newbuilds and maintenance of existing housing  stock.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have taken the Minister to see a number of projects in  Lagan Valley, one of which, the Dales flats, does not even meet health and  safety maintenance requirements. She knows about that situation, and, in  fairness to her, she found some maintenance budgets to try to deal with some of  the more critical health and safety issues that exist there. However, not all  those problems have been dealt with. I have taken that up with the Minister,  and she knows about the problems. Therefore, I am struggling with the concept  that reducing the budget by another &pound;40 million a year will deal with such  issues. I find that situation inconceivable, and it will lead only to further  reduction to the existing housing stock. If we fail to maintain that stock, it  will fall into disrepair and the number of newbuilds will increase. In the end,  that is counterproductive.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, I took the Minister to visit some pensioners&rsquo;  bungalows in Hillhall that have been waiting almost seven years for a major  maintenance scheme. In fact, the Minister was taken to a bungalow in which the  kitchen ceiling had fallen in. It had been that way for over a year, because  the maintenance budget was not available to repair it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That is why I am struggling with the idea that, by the wave  of some magic wand, reducing the existing maintenance budget will allow us to  continue to maintain our existing housing stock to the decent homes standard.  The Savills report is all well and good. It looked at a 10% sample of the  existing housing stock, but that is like looking at 10% of anything &mdash; where did  it look for that 10% sample? I do not have the answer to that, nor am I  accusing Savills of picking and choosing the areas that it looked at. Did it  look at the worst examples or the best examples? I do not know.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The figures in the report say that 17% of homes &mdash; some  15,000 &mdash; do not comply with the decent homes standard, and that 11,000 of those  homes failed to meet that standard because of inefficient heating systems.  Should we believe that a &pound;40 million reduction in the maintenance budget will  deal with that? Are we really condemning the people who live in those homes to  wait for another three, four or five years? If we fully implement the  recommendations of the Savills report, those people will have to live for 11 to  15 years with what they have already got. I do not believe that the Minister or  any member of the Committee wants that. However, I struggle with the concept  that reducing a budget does not have an impact on existing maintenance schemes.  I believe that such a reduction will, unfortunately, have a detrimental effect.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have looked at some of the figures in the report, and  unfortunately, there is an area that the Minister will need to look at. It is  clear that almost 70% of the areas in which maintenance performance was poorest  were in unionist areas. Those are the areas that will feel the most detrimental  effect of any reduction in the maintenance budget.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member must bring his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>:  There is an equality issue there that must be looked at and addressed. I  support the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Taca&iacute;m leis an r&uacute;n seo inniu.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion, which asks the Assembly to note the  findings of the Savills Report. The motion is timely, and I hope that the  Minister for Social Development will take its sentiments on board.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will outline a number of serious aspects of the report  that must be addressed because of possible grave consequences for the  maintenance of housing stock in the medium to long term. No matter how one  tries to dress up the report, it will have far-reaching implications for  Housing Executive tenants, many of whom live in homes that are situated in the  most deprived areas of the North.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The report points out that it surveyed 10% of the existing  housing stock against the decent homes plus standard and found that, in  comparison with other jurisdictions, our social housing stock was well  maintained by the Housing Executive. It goes on to say that 15,000 homes, or  17% of the stock, did not comply with the decent homes standard, 11,000 of  which failed because of inefficient heating systems.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One has to ask what the real purpose of the report was. It  says that Housing Executive stock is of a good standard, but it recommends that  we cut back across a whole range of environmental, security and maintenance  programmes, and that huge savings could be made if we went down that road. I  believe that the Minister intends to move ahead with the report&rsquo;s  recommendations regardless of the consequences. I say that on the back of a  question that I put to departmental officials at a Committee meeting a couple  of weeks ago.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">How can the changes that are recommended in the Savills  report be implemented, given the detrimental effect that they could have on  what remains of the social housing stock? The report says that the average rent  here is &pound;51&middot;89 a week, which is lower than in other jurisdictions, and goes on  to say that rents should be increased over a number of years. That would raise  a considerable amount of financial resources. What the report fails to take  into account, however, is that, on average, people here are on lower wages but  have to pay more for their fuel, travel and insurance, and for a range of  household items.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Under the heading of low value units and high maintenance  costs, the report states that 31,500 homes have a negative worth because of the  cost of maintenance over rental income over a 30-year period. The report states  that 10% are very poor, and goes on to mention poor performers in housing. It  mentions Ballymena, Craigavon, Belfast, Derry, Carrickfergus, Larne and  Coleraine. Those areas already suffer the worst social deprivation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The report touches on the Housing Executive&rsquo;s maintenance  of amenity land, grounds and trees, saying that it is excessive. However, that  programme is essential in ensuring that land does not become overgrown and that  trees do not grow out of control.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The report also targets disabled adaptation, and states  that costs are much higher, especially for one-bedroom bungalows, than in other  jurisdictions. If the Minister is to implement the recommendations in the  report, she must spell out what the impact will be on adaptations, whether unit  costs will be reduced and what that will do to the quality of work.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We in Sinn F&eacute;in have serious concerns. It does not matter  that we do things better than in other places. We should be proud of the fact  that we provide good housing and that we have a good policy of maintaining that  stock. Any departure from that, based on a report that compares what happens in  other jurisdictions with the way that we do things here, is a backwards step.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Can the Minister tell us how many people will lose their  jobs in the maintenance sector? Egan contractors employ over 1,000 people, not  to mention the suppliers and shops that depend on their spend. Hundreds of  small builders employ several thousand people, and they have told us that any  reduction in work levels will hit them hard. We could be storing up trouble for  the future if there is a reduction in the level to which multi-element  improvements are carried out. Thousands of people could be out of work if the  Minister pushes through the recommendations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There must be a breathing space in which to work out the  medium- to long-term impact that the implementation of the report would have on  the quality of housing. The British Chancellor has called for more investment  in housing stock as a way of creating employment and keeping our housing to a  good standard, but we seem to be going in the other direction.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Many people are waiting for the Minister to answer the  questions that I have outlined. Their livelihoods depend on it, as does the  future of our housing stock. To take up one of Simon&rsquo;s points, one of the  bywords that we often use is equality.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:  I ask the Member to draw his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Money must be allocated according to need. To do otherwise is to store up  trouble for the future, especially in the maintenance or the provision of  housing.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  One of the other myths is that most people would say that there are more people  employed in maintenance than in social rebuild.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>: I  support the motion. Demand for modern, purpose-built, suitable social housing  is on the increase. We must meet that demand in order to provide housing fit  for the twenty-first century. However, that does not necessarily mean building  new houses. I was concerned to read in the Savills report that 17% of the  current housing stock, out of a sample of 10%, did not conform to the decent  homes standard. Before my colleague Mr Craig gets ahead of me, I will mention  that there are pensioners&rsquo; bungalows in the Bloomfield estate that have been in need of  repair for 10 years. I hope that the Minister takes that on board.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The report found that 12% of the housing stock has  insufficient heating systems. That statistic is worrying, and it is relevant  given that we will debate a boiler scrappage scheme later today. It also raises  questions about the Department, given that it operates the warm homes scheme,  which seeks to combat fuel poverty. Heating inefficiencies are directly linked  to fuel poverty as they raise the costs of heating one&rsquo;s home. We must remember  that people in social housing have been granted homes because they are in  poverty or have a need, be it medical or other.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">(Mr Speaker in the Chair)</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Savills report argues that the cost of maintaining the  current housing stock for the next 30 years will be much lower than was  previously expected. How accurate can that assessment be? I am concerned about  the proposal to use the tendering process to gain value-for-money benefits. Are  we to see the Department squeeze contractors for everything that they have got?  In other words, get them to do more work for less money. Contractors are  struggling because the Minister has not provided them with the necessary  financial guarantees. That is not good enough for any business. They have to  plan for the future, especially with regards to staff. I would not want to see  anyone lose their job in the current climate, particularly because of financial  mismanagement. A Department should not be responsible for that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The report lacks a detailed breakdown and assessment of  current housing stock.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The report involves a sample of 10%, which I feel  is not representative. Some 17% of houses were found not to meet the decent  homes standard, but what is the real figure? Could it be much higher?</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also have questions about the decent homes standard. I  note that the Housing Executive strives to work to standards above those that are  established. However, what if those standards change? We always strive to raise  housing standards, so it is likely that the bar will be raised over the next 30  years. Surely that will have an impact on costs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the need for new houses, and I accept that a  considerable number of houses need to be replaced, because maintenance costs  will outweigh newbuild costs. Having said that, many houses are in need of  maintenance. However, the Department is loath to carry out the work and,  instead, focuses on newbuilds for the sake of them. I am concerned that that  approach is linked to the Minister&rsquo;s policy of promoting shared housing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We must watch costs, because the budget is tight. We must  not forget about people who live in houses that are not up to scratch. As is  stated in the motion, there must be equity in the newbuild and maintenance  budgets. One cannot fix something just by buying a new one, nor is it always  cost-effective to do so. I commend the motion to the House and make known my  concerns about the Savills report. The Minister&rsquo;s Department may use it to  reduce funding for maintaining existing Housing Executive stock.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development (Ms Ritchie)</strong>: I thank Members who have contributed to  the debate, and I welcome the opportunity to respond to, and clarify, some of  the issues that have been raised. I will try to address all the points that  Members raised. I assure them that I will study the Hansard report, and if I  find that I have left any questions unanswered, I will write directly to the  Member concerned.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There can be no Member who, by now, is not aware of the  shortfall that the housing budget suffered as a result of the land and property  market&rsquo;s collapse. With so much of my budget predicated on land and property  sales, it was inevitable that the downturn in the market would have a more  savage impact on housing than on elsewhere. I have been asked to find further  savings of more than &pound;30 million from my budget next year. If I am to continue  to protect vulnerable people and those in greatest need, it is vital that I  have reliable and up-to-date information on how best I can do it. That is  precisely why I commissioned the Savills report.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Savills undertook the work between November 2008 and March  2009. With the support of the Housing Executive, it visited more than 9,000  homes and analysed data for all 90,000-plus homes that were in Housing  Executive ownership at the time. The survey is the most comprehensive of its  kind ever to be undertaken on Housing Executive stock. The conclusions reached,  and the recommendations made, provide a detailed evidence base on which I, and  future Ministers with responsibility for housing, can make informed decisions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As an aside, Members may be interested to note the  conclusion that Housing Executive stock was by far the best-quality housing  stock in Britain and Northern Ireland  that Savills had ever inspected. The maintenance standard that the Housing  Executive adopted is well above the decent homes plus standard. Only 17% of the  stock failed that standard, and the majority of those properties failed only  because of the lack of an efficient heating system.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion calls on me to ensure equity in our newbuild and  maintenance programmes. I often hear suggestions that, as Minister, I am  focused only on the newbuild programme, to the detriment of other programmes.  That is absolute nonsense, and it ignores reality. In the past five years, we  have spent &pound;975 million on maintaining the existing stock. In that time, only  &pound;686 million was spent on building new homes. This year alone, we will spend  more on maintenance than on newbuilds. I have not stopped our maintenance  programmes: far from it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I make no apology for wanting to increase our housing  stock. I am proud that we will build more new homes this year than at any time  in the past decade. It is a fact that, today, almost 40,000 people are waiting  for social housing. The latest housing needs assessment from the Housing  Executive suggests the requirement to build 3,000 new homes per year to meet  housing need. At the same time, the quality of the housing stock has never been  better.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Informed choices need to be made. There is the need to know  that every pound spent makes the biggest possible impact on those in greatest  need. That is why the fact can no longer be ignored that, although we have a  housing stock that we can be proud of, there are record numbers of people on  waiting lists. Over the past five years, there has not been equity in how the  various housing programmes have been funded, and that is why there is now an  imbalance that must be addressed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The fact must not be lost sight of that my resources are intended,  first and foremost, to help those in greatest housing need: I fear sometimes  that Members might not grasp that. Whether my budget is focused on newbuild or  maintenance, it generates work across the construction industry. The motion may  have Members believing that only investment in maintenance helps the  beleaguered construction industry. That is clearly not the case. Professor Mike  Smyth of the University   of Ulster produced a  report last June that evaluated the case for public investment in social housing.  He noted that this was a particularly good time to increase investment in the  social housing development programme, given the falling costs of acquiring  materials, labour and, most importantly, land. Members with a genuine interest  in the work of the wider construction industry, rather than in that of a few  firms, will take comfort in that report and realise that my resources are  already indirectly supporting the industry, irrespective of the programmes  chosen for prioritisation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Let me touch on some of the other issues mentioned. The  Chairperson of the Committee for Social Development referred to dwelling  unfitness. The preliminary findings of the house condition survey for 2009 will  be made available on the Housing Executive&rsquo;s website next week. Some  interesting statistics have been compiled by that survey. In 2009, the total  dwelling stock was approximately 740,000. That represents a net increase of  35,000 since 2006 and the high number of dwelling completions at the height of  the housing boom.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Interestingly, the rate of dwelling unfitness has continued  to decline. In 2009, it stood at 2&middot;4%, compared to 3&middot;4% in 2006 and 4&middot;9% in  2001. The 2009 dwelling unfitness rates for social housing were 0&middot;1% and 0&middot;2%  for the Housing Executive and the housing associations respectively. I ask  Members to place this debate in that context. It demonstrates that we have been  tackling the issue of dwelling unfitness and we have the best quality social  housing stock in the Housing Executive sector in these islands.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Simon Hamilton also raised the issue that the reduction in  the Housing Executive capital works will have a detrimental impact on minority  communities. The Savills report does not recommend a complete halt to all  capital works; rather, it suggests that the full multi-element works, where  front door to back door replacements are carried out, should be replaced by  elemental improvements to kitchens, windows and bathrooms. Those should be  replaced when they reach the end of their useful life.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Simon also raised the issue of the terms of reference for  the review of rent setting or rent convergence. That is still under  consideration, and I will bring the report, on completion and following  evaluation, to the Committee for its consideration.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mickey Brady asked whether the reductions in expenditure  will affect Egan contractors. It will not affect them. Savills recommended that  there be an expansion of the Egan-type contractors to make efficiencies. Billy  Armstrong said that we should take a strategic look at how maintenance is  carried out. The report recommends a new asset management strategy to best-plan  for future maintenance of the Housing Executive stock.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That should address Mr Armstrong&rsquo;s concerns. Anna Lo raised  the issue of a reduction in work for Egan contractors if the budgets are  reduced. That is not the case.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Jonathan Craig raised the issue of what property Savills  looked at. The Savills survey was based on a representative sample of all house  types in a broad geographical area, and the 10% sample is considered by the  Department for Communities and Local Government to be sufficiently robust. If  one takes on board other recent samples, that is broadly representative of the  number of houses or people that are usually sampled in opinion polling. Mr  Craig also mentioned Dales Flats and Hillhall, which I was happy to visit and  saw examples of the work.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Fra McCann raised the issue of the impact of the  recommendations on disabled adaptations. My officials are working with  colleagues in the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety to  improve the systems for adaptations. However, the Savills report does not  suggest or recommend a reduction in adaptations; it just says that it should be  researched further, and that is what we are doing. Other issues were raised about  environmental works in estates and on amenity lands. The Savills report raises  concern about the &pound;10 million annual cost of ground maintenance. I share that  concern, but we are looking at all those issues in the round.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank Members for their contributions and for providing  us with a platform to debate the very real challenges that we now face in  delivering housing in Northern    Ireland. I trust that the Committee for  Social Development, which brought the motion, will be reassured to learn that  my scarce resources are being targeted at those in greatest housing need, and I  am sure that they would want it no other way.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Savills report presents us, for the first time, with a  clear picture of what we need to invest in, and when, if we are to maintain the  quality of our housing stock. Together with Mike Smith&rsquo;s report, it allows us  to look more closely at those housing programmes that have, perhaps, not been  as fully funded as they needed to be. The report is to help to bring about that  better balance in the allocation of funding, notwithstanding the housing budget  constraints, over which no one in the House or Northern Ireland has any control.  However, we now have the chance in the years ahead to redress that problem and  provide for those most in need.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, if nothing else today, we can dispel the myth that  there is no money to maintain homes. There will always be a budget to maintain  homes, and this year alone it will be almost &pound;170 million.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I suppose that being a Minister is about making decisions,  and sometimes they are difficult decisions. Those decisions are always easier  when they are informed by reality, an evidence base and research. The Savills  report now provides that reality. I made the report available to members of the  Committee for Social Development, and I have placed a copy in the Assembly  Library so that all Members can acquaint themselves with its findings. I would  have appreciated more Members being in the House for the debate, because such  reports are informative, but they also have far-reaching long-term  implications. Naturally, I am anxious to get the views of all Members.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Social Development (Mr Hilditch)</strong>: On  behalf of the Committee for Social Development, I thank the Members who  contributed to the debate and, in particular, the Minister for her answers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Much of the Savills report shows the Housing Executive in a  positive and, indeed debatably, commendable light. I hope that the House will  agree that, regardless of the controversial nature of some of its findings, the  report has injected the social housing debate with a much-needed fresh impetus.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The challenges that face the Department for Social  Development in respect of the funding of social housing, both for newbuilds and  capital works improvements, have been well set out by Members. The Social  Development Committee has previously brought issues of concern relating to Egan  contractors before the House. Today, however, our focus was on social houses  that need more than a modest investment and on estates that require significant  capital expenditure.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Everyone accepts that the decisions that flowed from the  collapse of the property market were never going to be easy or welcomed  universally. The Committee cannot provide the answers today, but this debate  has set out some guiding principles, the first of which is one of transparency.  The ramifications of significant changes in housing policy, be they related to  rent convergence or capital expenditure profiles, should be debated and  scrutinised by the Committee. The outworking of decisions about where money is  or is not spent must be demonstrably equitable, and cannot, through error or  omission, disadvantage parts of our community. Where substantial housing policy  changes are to be made, primary consideration must be given to tenants, and  then to the impact on the construction industry and the wider economy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Today&rsquo;s debate was characterised by many insightful and  forthright contributions. I will take a little time to remind the House of the  key thoughts of the Members who spoke. Mickey Brady highlighted the possible  adverse impact on tenants and contactors of the proposed reductions to the  Northern Ireland Housing Executive maintenance and improvement works. Thomas  Burns spoke about the aspects of the Savills report that highlighted the  achievement of the decent homes standard in a large percentage of Housing  Executive homes. He also identified the benefits of new social house-building  for the local economy and indicated that that should be a priority for the  Department.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Billy Armstrong called for a strategic review of housing  planning and the effective use of existing resources. He also identified longer  term issues that related to public finance. Anna Lo commended the Department  for commissioning the report and for its achievements in respect of the Northern  Ireland Housing Executive&rsquo;s stock quality to date. She highlighted fears about  the impact of the proposed reductions in expenditure for Egan contractors and  others, and warned the House of the danger of complacency with regard to the  Housing Executive stock quality. She also called for an independent body to set  social rents and for a new funding mechanism for other housing costs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Jonathan Craig spoke about the balance between newbuild and  maintenance in social housing, and the danger of further disrepair in the  social housing sector. He questioned the findings of the report and indicated  his difficulty in reconciling the Savills report&rsquo;s recommendations with the  impact on Northern Ireland Housing Executive tenants. Like other Members, he  raised the question of equality in respect of the strategic housing decisions.  He also gave some examples of areas of concern in his constituency.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Fra McCann questioned the report&rsquo;s recommendations on  raising social rents and the impact that that would have on deprived areas in Northern Ireland.  He called for the Minister to continue the Housing Executive&rsquo;s maintenance  policy, particularly the multi-element improvements, at least until equality  consideration was undertaken. Alex Easton highlighted disrepair issues in his  constituency. He spoke about how the adverse economic impact of the proposed  reductions in expenditure would affect contractors. He suggested that equality  was important in respect of the balance between newbuild and maintenance.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Minister for her response. She reminded the  House of the background to the financial difficulties that face social housing  in Northern Ireland.  She also pointed out that the Northern Ireland Housing Executive has adopted a  maintenance standard that is well above that in the rest of the UK.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">She further advised Members of the breakdown in spend  between newbuild and maintenance and how she intended to address what she deems  existing inequities. The Minister told the House of the benefit of newbuild to  the construction industry, and detailed the general reduction in unfitness  levels in the social housing stock. She said that she would advise the  Committee of the outcome of the rent review being conducted by her Department.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister refuted that Egan contractors would be  adversely affected and defended the statistical basis of the Savills report.  She highlighted that her Department is also to review environmental and grounds  maintenance costs and concluded that the Savills report would create an  opportunity to deliver future funding allocations to housing based on better  evidence.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It has been a very good debate, during which Members spoke  about or touched upon most of the issues of concern. I commend the motion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That this Assembly notes the findings of the Savills  report; calls on the Minister for Social Development to ensure equity in the  delivery of new social housing and the maintenance of existing Housing  Executive stock; and further calls on the Minister to limit the reduction in  funding for Housing Executive maintenance contractors, in view of the adverse  economic situation.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  As Question Time commences at 2.30 pm, I suggest that the House take its ease  until then.</p>

    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Maternity Services</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">1. <strong>Mr  Butler </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  which hospitals with maternity units will exceed capacity limitations as a  result of the planned maternity closures at hospitals such as Lagan Valley; and  for his assessment of any possible health and safety implications for patients.  (AQO 879/10<a name="AQO879/10" id="AQO879/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: Safe, sustainable  maternity services are a top priority for my Department. It is precisely  because of the need to ensure safe services that the obstetrics unit at Lagan Valley   Hospital will close. Work  is already under way to ensure that any hospital affected by the withdrawal of  obstetric services from Lagan   Valley Hospital  will have the extra capacity to meet any increase in demand.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I recently invested &pound;4&middot;2 million in maternity services at  the Royal and &pound;3&middot;5 million at Craigavon   Area Hospital.  A community midwifery unit has opened in Downpatrick, and there will be a  midwifery-led unit in place in Lagan   Valley Hospital  before the withdrawal of obstetric services. I also have plans to increase  maternity capacity at the Ulster   Hospital.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Butler</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an freagra sin. I  welcome the Minister&rsquo;s answer. In the Developing Better Services document, the  trust stated that people from Lisburn who need to avail of maternity services  will travel to the Ulster   Hospital in Dundonald.  However, there is a view held by many, in particular the Royal College of  Nursing, that that will not happen and that most women travelling from Lisburn  will go to Craigavon Area Hospital or to the Royal Jubilee Maternity Service.  Given that those hospitals are under increasing pressure, does the Minister  accept that they will not have the capacity to deliver a quality maternity  service?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: As far as capacity is concerned,  the South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust operates Lagan Valley   Hospital, and expectant  mums in that trust area will go to that hospital. I also anticipate that they  will avail of Craigavon   Area Hospital  and the Royal Jubilee Maternity Service, which is why, as I said in my previous  answer, I have invested in maternity services at those hospitals to address the  point that Mr Butler makes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>:  From answers to questions a number of months ago it was clear that there was a  lack of capacity of around 700 births, and I know that the birth rate in Lagan Valley   Hospital is 1,200 at  present. Will the Minister give us some assurances that the new midwifery-led  unit will be in open and in place before any reduction in numbers takes place  in Lagan Valley Hospital,  which would cause a major issue around capacity in the whole South Eastern  Trust region?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: As I said in my previous answer,  there will be a midwifery-led unit in place in Lagan Valley   Hospital before the  withdrawal of obstetric services. That is my intention, and we will go forward  with that. There is capacity in the entire system, but getting the capacity to  match the demand is always an issue, particularly with the dramatic rise in the  birth rate over the past number of years. However, there is still spare  capacity in the system to deal with demand, particularly following the  investment that I referred to today, as well as the new midwifery units at Downe Hospital  and at Lagan Valley Hospital.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  Does the Minister agree that further investment is needed in the maternity  units due to the increase in demand for our hospitals&rsquo; maternity services? Is  there any reason why the health budget should be cut, as advocated by the DUP  and Sinn F&eacute;in, when finances are needed?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I can only make the argument  that the health budget should not be cut, and I have made that argument  repeatedly, particularly because demand has risen so dramatically over the past  few years, not just in maternity services but in services generally.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At the weekend, I listened to the president of Sinn F&eacute;in  say at his party&rsquo;s ard-fheis that Sinn F&eacute;in would not accept cuts to the Health  Service, or words to that effect. There was an irony to those remarks, bearing  in mind the stance of Sinn F&eacute;in in the Chamber.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  In light of the further pressure that the current budget will place on  maternity services, will the Minister explain to the House how he can stand  over the payment of &pound;11 million in bonuses to consultants, including obstetric  consultants, this year? Will he follow the lead of his Scottish counterpart in  seeking to have that controversial consultants&rsquo; bonus scheme suspended until  the economic situation improves?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I have never regarded that award  as controversial; it is viewed as controversial by some who have a desire for  consultants&rsquo; pay to be cut. I note that Mr McDevitt has talked along those  lines on a number of occasions, as he did at a Health Committee meeting, where  he spoke about cutting low pay and ensuring that low-paid workers would see a  pay freeze.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The merit award is for exceptional personal contributions  made by individual doctors who show commitment to achieving the delivery of  high-quality care and continuous improvement of the health and social care  service. It also helps to ensure that Northern Ireland remains  competitive in the international consultant labour market. A consultant in Northern Ireland could double his or her salary  by moving to a job south of the border or in Scotland. One paediatrician is  currently doing that, and, recently, we lost a consultant from Altnagelvin Area  Hospital to the Irish Republic.  Consultants can quadruple their salary if they go to the United States.  The awards are for the best performers in the consultancy teams. We have some  of the best doctors in Europe. Our service  depends on them, and we must do what we can to hold on to them and to benefit  from their knowledge, skills and experience.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A recent review of the scheme found that the recognition  and reward of the achievements of the consultant workforce continues to be  appropriate. Scotland  has a different merit award system, and, since it has a larger workforce, its  merit award scheme is more expensive. Our scheme costs less than 0&middot;3% of the  relevant budget.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Carrickfergus and Larne: &nbsp;Health Centres</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">2. <strong>Mr  Neeson </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety what  his Department is doing to improve health centre facilities in Carrickfergus  and Larne. (AQO 880/10<a name="AQO880/10" id="AQO880/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: In November 2008, I announced a  significant capital investment of &pound;175 million to improve health and social  care services and facilities in the Northern Health and Social Care Trust. That  investment will enable key projects to be taken forward, including new health  and care centres for Larne and Carrickfergus. The Northern Trust is developing  business cases for new health and care centres, and they are due to be  submitted to my Department later in the year.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his response. Is he aware that Carrickfergus Borough  Council has spent millions of pounds on a new leisure centre in Carrickfergus  and that Larne Borough Council is spending a substantial amount of money on its  recreational facilities? When does the Minister hope that work on those  projects will commence?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: In the investment strategy for Northern Ireland,  as it stands, I have allowed for new health and care centres in Larne and Carrickfergus.  I am not in a position to announce the date on which that work will commence.  Much will depend on announcements about the money, capital and resource  available to my Department. We are also developing a health and care centre in  Ballymena, which is also in the Northern Trust. There are, therefore, three  important primary care developments planned for the Northern Trust area, among  others. Much depends on capital and resource. I hope to be in a position to  make a definitive date known, as far as I can.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hilditch</strong>:  I declare an interest as a co-author of the health village concept in  Carrickfergus. We have received a good interagency response. We have also  received a good response from the Minister. Will the Minister and the  Department initiate further talks on that joined-up and innovative way to  deliver related aspects of well-being in Carrickfergus? Perhaps, they will  stumble upon some of the extra resources that are required.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: In pursuit of that development,  I met Mr Hilditch at Carrickfergus Borough Council. I also met other Members,  such as Mr Neeson and Mr Ken Robinson. It is a good idea to form a brigade of  units, such as leisure facilities, libraries and health-and-care centres. In  particular, I look to the Grove Wellbeing Centre on the York Road in Belfast, which is the result of work between  the Belfast Trust, Belfast City Council and the library authority. There are  savings on the cost of site acquisition and build. The centre fosters good  working and symbiotic relationships between staff and people who visit it. It  all works together. I am keen to do that in Carrickfergus, as I am keen to do  it in other places. That is very much part of the calculation.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his positive comments about health provision in  Carrickfergus and Larne. I want to draw his attention to the third element of  the East Antrim constituency, Newtownabbey, where people feel somewhat  neglected because they have lost certain facilities from Whiteabbey Hospital.  Will the Minister tell the House what facilities will be brought to the  Whiteabbey/Newtownabbey area that will enhance its health provision?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Mr Ken Robinson will be aware  that the Department has plans for a health-and-care centre to take forward  primary care provision on the Whiteabbey   Hospital site, as well as  other plans for Whiteabbey.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are moving towards the Developing Better Services model.  That will require changes on a number of hospital sites, rather than closures.  I hope to be able to announce some exciting changes for Whiteabbey, which are  part of planning that is going forward. The Whiteabbey and Newtownabbey  area has certainly not been overlooked. I consider it to be another key area  for development.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Swine Flu</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">3. <strong>Mr P J  Bradley </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety if  and when he will launch a review into the response of his Department and the  Health Service to the swine flu outbreak. (AQO 881/10<a name="AQO881/10" id="AQO881/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Northern Ireland has been one of  the best prepared countries in the world. My Department&rsquo;s response has been  proportionate, appropriate and robust. That has been part of a UK-wide response  to the pandemic. At all times, Health Ministers have collectively based  decisions on the best scientific advice from national expert groups. I have  already commenced a review of Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s pandemic response. The review&rsquo;s  findings will contribute to wider assessment of the overall UK response  proposals, which are currently under consideration.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr PJ Bradley</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer, in which he referred to a review. Does he  agree that there is a need to co-ordinate a regional response to epidemics,  such as swine flu, given that his Department holds a considerable stockpile of  unused vaccines?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The pandemic response was very  much a UK-wide response. England,  Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland operated on the  best scientific advice that was available from the World Health Organization,  the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, and the Joint Committee on  Vaccination and Immunisation. I have set out a number of steps that were taken  as we progressed through treatment into containment, such as strategies for  communications, surge capacity, hospitals, community services, critical care,  equipment, vaccines and so on.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that the response is reviewed because that  is not the last pandemic that Northern    Ireland will see. The swine flu virus is  still circulating. There is still a possibility of a third wave of infection.  It is also anticipated that swine flu will make up the bulk of the seasonal flu  virus in 2010 and in some years to come. Therefore, the virus will stay with  us.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Northern    Ireland got its share of vaccines according  to the UK-wide order. At present, the bulk of those vaccines is with primary  care providers and trusts. The vaccination programme continues. It is important  that a strategic reserve is kept in Northern   Ireland and in the UK.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The reviews that I am announcing for Northern Ireland and the review that I  anticipate being announced in due course for the UK as a whole will better inform us  all.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  I listened carefully to what the Minister said when he was cross-examined about  the &pound;11 million bonuses. I understand that the Minister recently made a  statement in which he said that he had overestimated the swine flu vaccine to  the tune of &pound;61 million. Will he give an undertaking to the House that when he  carries out the review that he spoke of he will also carry out a financial  review? Does he accept that he made a gross overestimation in this financial  year? Will he assure the House that that will not be repeated?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: No doubt, the benefit of  hindsight is a key entry requirement for the House of Lords. The health and  well-being of the people of Northern    Ireland are foremost in my mind. All the way  through the pandemic, we followed every piece of advice that we were given on  swine flu. We began with estimates from epidemiologists, who made particular  estimates on our ability to cope. The &pound;61 million was an estimate. However,  that estimate came down, and, before moneys were ever allocated, it was well  down. Indeed, there is a long story to be told about the money for swine flu. I  am quite sure that the review will take that story on board and have a good  look at it and that individuals in the Executive who deal with finance will not  come out of it particularly well.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The review will be as wide-ranging as I can make it,  because this is not the last pandemic that Northern Ireland will see, and it  will certainly not be the last worldwide pandemic that we will have to deal  with. The lessons that we learned in dealing with the pandemic will be  important. However, a key element was getting the vaccine in place while the  swine flu was surging, because that had a strong effect on reducing the surge.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Podiatry</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">4. <strong>Mr  Spratt </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety if  he can provide an assurance that there will be long-term investment in podiatry  services despite public spending cuts. (AQO 882/10<a name="AQO882/10" id="AQO882/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I am fully committed to  providing a high-quality, safe and effective Health Service for the population  of Northern Ireland.  However, it is proposed to cut my budget by &pound;92 million, which is more than the  total &pound;76 million budget for new services. I can give no assurances about  long-term investment in podiatry or other services at this stage. The current  financial uncertainty requires creative thinking, and, therefore, all services  in health and social care will be required to ensure an effective use of  services that maximises outcomes and provides value for money. In that regard,  podiatry services are no different to any other service, and trusts will need  to ensure that the services that they provide are targeted at those who need  them most.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>: I  partly thank the Minister for his answer. Some very good work is ongoing in  health centres etc on diseases such as diabetes and on podiatry services and  the preventative measures that they provide. Does the Minister agree that spending  money on preventative medicine reduces the burden on the main health budget at  a later stage?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I could have written Mr Spratt&rsquo;s  comment about spending money on preventative medicine. Clearly, he has been  reading and listening to what I have been saying in here for the past three  years. The need to press down on demand on the Health Service is about working upstream  rather than always working downstream, which is about prevention. That is why I  decided to set up the Public Health Agency, the establish&shy;ment of which the DUP  decided to oppose. Indeed, it was the only party in the House to do so.  However, I agree with the Member&rsquo;s sentiments about allied health. Podiatry,  physiotherapy, occupational therapy, dietetics and so on all have a significant  role to play in ensuring that we keep people out of hospital.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  The question refers to cuts in public spending. I understand that the Minister  has not yet briefed the Committee on his plans to address the reduction in his  budget for next year. Will he care to outline his plans on this occasion? To  what extent does he feel that he can address the pressures on his budget  through efficiency savings without reducing front line services in any way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I am sure that Mr O&rsquo;Loan is  aware that we have several hundred lines of service in health and social care,  and all of that has to be carefully balanced to maintain, as far as possible, a  service that addresses the needs of the population of Northern Ireland.  However, currently, because there is not enough money available, we are  providing health and social care according to budget, money and resource,  rather than according to need. I recall that Mr O&rsquo;Loan was one of those who  voted for those cuts and those efficiencies.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are in a situation that is largely created by a rise in  demand and the inability of the House to see a way forward to meet that demand.  Therefore, we have a Health Service that is not entirely meeting need, so I  have to make very careful decisions. I will make the plans known in due course,  but I hope that I will not be listening to a chorus of people telling me that I  should not be doing something or other, when the very people who will make up  that chorus will be those who engineered the situation in the first place.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Pharmaceutical List</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">5. <strong>Ms S  Ramsey </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety for  his assessment of the fairness of the application and appeal process, known as  &ldquo;control of entry&rdquo;, for inclusion on the pharmaceutical list. (AQO 883/10<a name="AQO883/10" id="AQO883/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: My Department has been contacted  on several occasions recently by pharmacists aggrieved at the refusal of their  application to join the pharmaceutical list and the failure of their appeal to  the national appeal panel. I am aware that officials in England and Wales have looked at the issue of  control of entry and have made changes to the application process. A review is  planned in Scotland.  My officials will look at the issue as part of the development of a new  contract for community pharmacy.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his answer. I  know that he has been slated for previous answers, but it is to be welcomed  that his officials are looking at what is happening in England and Scotland. I have also raised  concerns indirectly with the Minister&rsquo;s office about that issue, and there is  genuine concern about the involvement of people on that list. I welcome the  fact that the Minister is considering the possibility of a review. If possible,  will he tell the House whether he will do that and, perhaps, give a timescale  for it? There is genuine concern about that matter in constituencies.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Pharmacy is clearly an important  area because of the cost of the drugs budget. The issue is that the bulk of the  drugs budget goes through community pharmacy, so I am looking at procurement  and the provision of generic drugs. The Member will be aware that the  percentage of generic drugs used here has risen in the last three years from  43% to 64%. We are rapidly catching up on England, where 59% of drugs were  generic at the time when it was 43% here. The percentage there is now 68%, so  we have a wee bit to go, but we can catch up, and that will make major savings.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are other savings to be made in relation to  procurement, and I am considering that. On the key point that the Member makes,  which relates to control of entry, one of the issues is that, pro rata, there  are far more pharmacies here than in England, Scotland or Wales. In fact, we  have 524 pharmacies; working roughly on a benchmark with England, Scotland  or Wales  that number would be around 340 or 350. We have an oversupply and  overprovision, so the people who are carrying out control of entry are clearly  looking at that and wondering about the need. That does not actually address  the central issue for the Member, which is that community pharmacies should be  placed in areas of disadvantage where there is need. That is all part of the  mix as far as I am concerned.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Community pharmacy plays an important role in prevention,  which relates to Mr Spratt&rsquo;s point earlier. I am looking at that issue very  closely.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  The Minister&rsquo;s response to that question was very positive. In relation to the  control of entry and drug procurement, we are all keen that savings be made  through drug procurement. Those savings could, in turn, be used to ensure that  some other drugs that are not currently available are made available. Can the  Minister assure us that the savings that will be made will be used for other  drugs, such as the cancer drugs?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Mr Shannon makes a good point.  Drugs that generate important advances in the treatment of conditions are  coming on the market constantly, and I invest and have been investing in that,  year on year. Part of my resources for new service developments for the coming  financial year, budget cuts permitting, is for new drugs. I am always looking  to make savings, and I will continue to do so. However, one issue that arises  is resistance in the industry, and I have to be able to work with the industry  and take it with me as far as possible.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although significant savings have been made to the drugs  budget and significant advances have been made in the use of generic medicines,  much more progress can be made. I shall continue to do my best to make that  progress, because every penny that we save in that area will, as Mr Shannon  said, be made available for important new drug treatments on the market.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Question 6 has been withdrawn.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Family Restoration Fund</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">7. <strong>Mr  Durkan </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety what  discussions he or his Department has had with British ministerial counterparts  in relation to the operation of and access to the family restoration fund,  announced by the Prime Minister on Wednesday 24 February 2010. (AQO 885/10<a name="AQO885/10" id="AQO885/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The family restoration fund will  benefit child migrants from the whole of the UK. Discussions are taking place  among officials from the Northern Ireland Office, my Department and the Department  of Health in London  on how the fund will operate. The detail has not yet been finalised.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his answer. As the details are worked through, I  encourage him to take account not only of the needs of the people who went to Australia  and elsewhere and who know that they are child migrants but of those of the  many people who were left here in all-too-abusive care who believe that their  siblings and friends were transported. Those people have been trying to make  enquiries but have been told that information and records are not available.  Will those people also be able to seek assistance and support through the  family restoration fund?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Mr Durkan&rsquo;s question indicates  that he is aware that the family restoration fund was announced by the Prime  Minister on 24 February. I had no advance knowledge of the detail of the fund,  and I am asking questions to find out how it will affect Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The fund  will support travel and other costs for former migrants who wish to be reunited  with their families.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When I examined the statistics and the background, I was  shocked to learn the number of children who were involved in the process over  150 years. We will obviously be considering the more recent cases. Between 1947  and 1967, between 7,000 and 10,000 children were sent to Australia from the UK. Before that, Canada was the  main reception country, but the Canadian Government stopped and banned the  practice through an Order in Council in 1925.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Between 1938 and 1956, Catholic agencies sent a total of  1,109 children from the UK  to Australia, 103 of whom  are known to have come from Catholic agencies in Northern Ireland. The detail is as  sparse as that. I am also aware that a number of other voluntary agencies, such  as Dr Barnardo&rsquo;s, played a role.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is a question of tracking down the families of migrant  children and trying to make a connection. It seems that it will prove quite a  stretch for &pound;6 million to deal with the numbers concerned.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I apologise for being late, but I have had a last-minute thought. The Minister  mentioned the years between 1947 and 1967, and I know that a Government were in  this Building during that period. The statistics may be somewhere in Northern Ireland, so the buck may not need to be  passed to Westminster.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Mr McCarthy has had a  last-minute thought on passing the buck. It is a serious issue, and I am not  aware of any records outside of, perhaps, the Public Record Office. All of that  must be considered, and we have to determine how best to find the information,  particularly by using the organisations that dispatched the children. Those  organisations will be the first port of call.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is very difficult. I think that the onus is on the  migrant children who are seeking to come back rather than on us, because some  of those affected might not be interest in coming back. The process is complex  and is at a very early stage.</p>

    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Northern Ireland Water: Investment</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">1. <span class="BoldText">Mr McNarry</span> asked  the Minister for Regional Development for an update on the long-term investment  plan for NI Water, given that its existing strategic business plan ends this  month. (AQO 892/10<a name="AQO892/10" id="AQO892/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">The Minister for Regional  Development (Mr Murphy)</span>: Northern Ireland Water&rsquo;s (NIW) investment plan  for the next three years has been developed in light of draft ministerial  guidance that I consulted on last spring. That was informed by research on  customers&rsquo; views conducted by the Consumer Council. The key themes of the  research were: improving service quality for customers; meeting EU obligations;  promoting sustainability; and delivering efficiency. The priorities for  investment have been agreed with stakeholders in the water sector, including  the Drinking Water Inspectorate, the Environment Agency and the Consumer  Council. NIW issued a draft business plan in June 2008 setting out its plans  and the costs involved. That has been scrutinised by the Utility Regulator,  which issued its recommendations last month. I am considering those  recommendations, and I will put my proposals to the Executive shortly.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">Mr McNarry</span>: I appreciate  the Minister&rsquo;s reply. The existing NIW business plan states that the objective  for the period ending this month was to build a business that delivers  efficient, sustainable water and waste water services for its customers.  However, does the Minister agree that Northern Ireland Water&rsquo;s billing  systems were not up to scratch during that period? Does he intend to monitor  the business more closely in the next period to achieve a service that is fit  for purpose? If so, does he expect to see an immediate improvement?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">The Minister for Regional  Development</span>: I agree with the Member that there were difficulties with  the billing system. The information systems that NIW inherited from the Water  Service contained difficulties that became apparent during the course of that  business plan. I scrutinise closely the operations and workings of NIW, as an  entity, and I intend to do so to ensure that it continues to improve. There  have been improvements since that error was discovered, but we need to continue  to strive for further improvements across all aspects of its functions.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">Mr McCartney</span>: Go raibh  maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as an fhreagra  sin agus as an cheann eile.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Has the Minister received the independent report examining  governance issues within NIW?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">The Minister for Regional  Development</span>: I received the report last week. It brought to light a  number of serious issues, and I am considering its recommendations. I have been  in consultation with officials from NIW and the Department about the report,  and I will take a decision on its recommendations in the near future.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">Mr Shannon</span>: It is important  that we have some idea about NIW&rsquo;s long-term investment plan. There has been  long-term investment in my constituency of Strangford, and yet NIW has not  returned to fix the roads and to finish the system as it should have done. Will  the Minister, therefore, assure the House that NIW&rsquo;s long-term investment  extends to a monitoring system that ensures that it actually finishes the work  that it starts?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">The Minister for Regional  Development</span>: I would have been surprised if the Member had not raised an  issue relating to Ards.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a statutory requirement on the water company and  all utilities to restore roads to the state in which they found them. A recent  Public Accounts Committee report on the issue contained a series of  recommendations with which the Department agreed, and I expect that scrutiny of  that type of work will improve accordingly. Although a requirement already  existed, the Public Accounts Committee felt that that needed to be tightened up  substantially, and the Department intends to do that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">Mr Gallagher</span>: Given that  Northern Ireland Water will have &pound;527 million to spend on capital expenditure  schemes over the next three years, will the Minister tell us whether he will  take steps to amend and widen the procurement framework for contracts in order  to provide greater opportunities for Northern Ireland companies to participate  and, indeed, for their employees to have more stability and security in their  jobs?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">The Minister for Regional  Development</span>: The general sense in the Executive, not just in my  Department, is that we must ensure that public money spent by the Executive,  particularly on capital projects, is used to maximise the benefit for the local  economy. Certainly, in any of my discussions with NIW, I have repeated that  advice. I asked NIW to invite in all the contractors that are on its books, big  and small, to ensure that they are fully au fait with how procurement will  operate and fully informed of all the information necessary, so that they can  bid for work and be quite sure that they stand as good a chance as anyone of  getting it. It is not just a matter for NIW. All Departments and government  agencies that spend public money must try to maximise the benefit for the local  economy, particularly in these difficult times.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Road Repairs</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">2. <span class="BoldText">Mr Lunn</span> asked the  Minister for Regional Development for an estimate of the total cost of  repairing potholes caused by the recent bad weather. (AQO 893/10<a name="AQO893/10" id="AQO893/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">The Minister for Regional  Development</span>: Roads Service has advised that a repeated freezing and  thawing cycle, as experienced during the recent spell of cold weather, has a  damaging effect on the roads network, causing carriageway to split and potholes  to form. Due to the size of the roads network, it may be some time before  assessments are completed and the full extent of the damage and cost of  carrying out repairs is known. Additionally, as it would not be practical to  diagnose every individual failure that led to the formation of the indentified  potholes, one cannot say with any certainty whether they were caused by the  recent bad weather or by other factors. For those reasons, an estimated total  cost of repairing the potholes caused by the recent cold spell cannot be  provided.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, I can confirm that, since the beginning of  January, additional funding of approximately &pound;16&middot;6 million has been allocated  to Roads Service divisions. That money will be used to progress predetermined  programmes of work targeting the worst roads and to deal with the effects of  the recent cold spell.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">Mr Lunn</span>: The Minister will  probably agree with the rest of us that the greatest frost damage this year,  caused by an exceptional winter, has been to minor and rural roads. Therefore,  can he confirm that he will allow Roads Service to give some priority to those  minor roads?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">The Minister for Regional  Development</span>: We attempted to get additional money, and have received  approximately &pound;16&middot;6 million. That will be allocated fairly across Roads Service  divisions and applied on the basis of which roads have been most damaged and  need the most attention. I have stated many times in the Chamber, and the Member  will be aware, that the budget for structural maintenance is not sufficient  and, therefore, the roads are more susceptible. However, we accept that this  was an exceptionally cold winter &mdash; the most protracted cold spell since 1981 &mdash;  and one which caused a substantial amount of damage to the roads. Nonetheless,  it is recognised that there is not enough money in structural maintenance and  that means that, in spells of weather such as this, the roads get a particular  pounding.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">Lord Morrow</span>: I was  interested in the Minister&rsquo;s reply concerning the severe winter. Is the  Minister prepared to commission a report in relation to roads in the Dungannon,  Aughnacloy and Caledon  area, which have suffered severely as a result of the construction of the A4?  Heavy vehicles, which would not normally use those roads, are using the roads,  and they are in a deplorable condition. Can the Minister give assurances that  he will carry out a survey of that area to ascertain the damage that has been  caused?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">The Minister for Regional  Development</span>: I advise the Member that a broader report was commissioned  on structural maintenance and the effect on the roads of the shortfall in  structural maintenance. I recommend that the Member take the opportunity to  study that report, which was conducted by Professor Snaith. In relation to the  roads that the Member mentioned, I have the opportunity this week to visit that  project and I will certainly take up with Roads Service managers the matters  that he raised.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">Mr McElduff</span>: Go raibh maith  agat, a Cheann Comhairle. The Minister said that he needs additional money for  the roads structural maintenance budget. How does he go about trying to secure  additional funding for that very necessary project? Will he encourage the  divisional Roads Service managers to carry out a PR initiative aimed at  explaining what people should do when they come across potholes? They should  not just ring elected representatives; they should ring Roads Service directly.  I would like that to be said. Give out the phone numbers, please.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">The Minister for Regional  Development</span>: The Department commissioned the Snaith review of structural  maintenance funding, which underlined what Roads Service, the Department and I  had been saying for some time. Based on 2009 prices, it is estimated that &pound;108  million will be required for structural maintenance this year. Roads Service  has received only &pound;85 million, which equates to a shortfall of &pound;23 million for  2009-2010 alone. The Snaith review reinforced the message that more money is  required for investment in structural maintenance here, but Roads Service and  the Department are competing with other Departments&rsquo; very worthy demands for  Executive resources for areas such as education and health. The Department bats  as best as it can to secure the money that is required, and I have said in the  House on many occasions that the single biggest asset owned by the Executive is  the roads network and that it needs investment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Information is available to the public, and I can ensure  that it is made more prominent. However, the telephone numbers of Roads Service  divisional offices are quite easily available to the public. I accept that the  Member would prefer that Roads Service managers were bothered about potholes  rather than him, and I will ensure that people are made aware of that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">Mr Kinahan</span>: Will the  Minister clarify whether roads are being repaired well enough? We have had a  really bad winter, and we will probably have more bad winters in the future.  Therefore, should we review how we repair roads so that they stay in good  condition when we have such appalling weather?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">The Minister for Regional  Development</span>: Again, I recommend the Snaith review to the Member. It  provides evidence that it is necessary for some repair work to be carried out  on our roads so that they do not become dangerous or a hazard for drivers.  However, the resources are not there to carry out all the longer-term repairs  that are needed and the roads are suffering as a result. The patching work that  is carried out is necessary because the safety of the travelling public is  paramount. However, it does not do the job of addressing the long-term  interests of the roads structure.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Road Gritting</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">3. <span class="BoldText">Mr P J Bradley</span> asked  the Minister for Regional Development for an update on the expenditure for the current  winter gritting programme for rural roads. (AQO 894/10<a name="AQO894/10" id="AQO894/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">The Minister for Regional  Development</span>: Roads Service has advised that it is unable to provide  specific details of expenditure on rural roads but that the overall expenditure  on the current winter service programme up to 31 January 2010 was &pound;5&middot;1 million.  Some 67,123 tons of salt were used up to 31 January 2010, of which 8,677 were  targeted at secondary salting of roads in the vicinity of the 46 rural schools  that were identified as being most affected by the winter weather conditions,  as well as at filling salt boxes and replenishing grit supplies.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">Mr P J Bradley</span>: I thank the  Minister for his answer, and I note the answers that he gave to questions from  Mr Lunn, Mr McElduff and other Members. Does the Minister agree that the  ever-increasing severity of our winter weather means that some level of  preparation should be undertaken to deal with the worst long-term scenarios,  which are more likely to occur in the winters ahead?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">The Minister for Regional  Development</span>: It is not always easy to predict the winters that we get.  This winter was the coldest since 1981, but previous winters were not as bad.  We suffered more from heavy rain and flooding than from freezing conditions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Roads Service was probably better prepared than any other  service across these islands. It was the only service that did not get into a  panic over salt supplies; it had a full stock. There was an early cold spell  around October when some of the salt was used, but Roads Service topped up its  supplies and kept a regular supply coming from the salt mines in Carrickfergus.  Roads Service was alone among roads service operators across these islands, in  either Ireland or Britain, in  being well prepared. It had adequate supplies of salt while others were running  short. As I said when I answered the Member&rsquo;s initial question, not only did it  salt the main road network but it put a substantial amount of salt on secondary  routes and in and around the schools that we identified last year as having  difficulties in the cold weather and which had to close as a result.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Just like with structural maintenance, Departments argue  and bid for as much money as possible and compete with other Executive demands  on a range of other issues. As the Member will know, the Minister from his  party has focused on the need for more money to be allocated for social  housing. All Departments argue for money so that they have better resources to  help them to prepare for whatever situations they face. Roads Service did a  very good job this year with the resources that it had.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">Mr I McCrea</span>: Will the  Minister assure the House that if there is a continual cold spell, the weather  worsens or next year turns out to be as bad as this year, Roads Service will  work with local councils to ensure that grit is available to local communities,  particularly those in a rural setting?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">The Minister for Regional  Development</span>: The issue of replenishing grit piles and salt boxes can be  tackled through elected representatives or by rural communities and Roads  Service. Local councils do not necessarily need to be involved. Roads Service  is willing to work with all local representatives and councils to ensure a  proper supply of grit and salt.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I suggest to the Member that the best option is to identify  the location of grit piles and salt boxes in the summer and to ensure that  Roads Service comes out to replenish them. People often report, in the middle  of a cold spell, that it is impossible to drive up a particular road, but it is  also impossible to drive up that road to replenish a grit pile. People should  ensure that the key work is done before the winter by identifying problem areas  and talking to their local divisional managers to ensure that grit piles and  salt boxes are topped up. There are about 4,500 grit piles across rural areas,  and Roads Service is willing to ensure that local communities can use them.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">Mr Boylan</span>: Go raibh maith  agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Does the Minister intend to use local farmers to  clear blocked roads during adverse weather conditions?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">The Minister for Regional  Development</span>: On occasions, a provision has been used for local farmers  to clear snow from blocked roads. If that is the provision to which the Member  refers, it is ongoing, and some farmers are engaged on an as-needed basis. The  question has been raised of whether farmers could be involved in gritting, and  I discussed that with the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development and  officials from both Departments. Our conclusion was that the best option, for a  range of reasons, was for Roads Service to continue its operation of the  gritting service. The arrangement will continue whereby local farmers become  involved in clearing roads that have become blocked by snow.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Speed Limits: Schools</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">4. <span class="BoldText">Miss McIlveen</span> asked  the Minister for Regional Development whether he plans to extend the 20 mph  speed limit pilot project that is in place outside school premises. (AQO  895/10<a name="AQO895/10" id="AQO895/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">The Minister for Regional  Development</span>: In September 2008, Roads Service introduced part-time 20  mph speed limit pilot projects at two rural schools. In September 2009, a  further pilot project at an urban school was added. Roads Service has been  monitoring the pilot projects over the school year and is finalising its report  on the findings to date. I expect that the board of Roads Service will consider  the final report in the near future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Roads Service is also reviewing its speed management  policy, and it is expected that the details of that review, which includes the  use of variable speed limits at schools, will be published shortly. Should it  be decided to extend the initiative beyond the pilot projects, each site will  be considered on its merits, and appropriate criteria will be developed to  determine the priorities. In the current financial climate, any possible future  implementation of such a programme will depend on the availability of  additional capital funding.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">Miss McIlveen</span>: I welcome  the Minister&rsquo;s response to my question. I have a specific concern about schools  that sit on the periphery of rural towns and thus are neither in the country&shy;side  nor within a built-up conurbation. Will he include such schools in his  deliberations? How much has he allocated to the project?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">The Minister for Regional  Development</span>: The first of the two ongoing studies is the pilot project  on the use of variable signs. Those signs activate at particular times, such as  when children arrive at or leave school, and they can be switched off in the  school holidays. The pilot runs at two locations in the northern division of  Roads Service, one of which is an urban area. The initial findings have been  extremely positive, as the signs have reduced the speed of passing vehicles. I  expect the confirmed results to lead to requests from other schools in urban  and urban/rural settings for similar projects. That will depend on the  availability of funding. The results of the speed management survey, which also  examines speed management outside primary schools, should be published soon.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">Mr McDevitt</span>: The Minister  will know that the chance of being killed when hit by a car travelling at 30  mph is about one in five. That reduces to one in 40 when hit by a car  travelling at 20 mph. Does the Minister agree that it is time for a serious  region-wide conversation about extending the 20 mph speed limit to all urban  residential streets?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">The Minister for Regional  Development</span>: That conversation is ongoing. As I said, I hope to publish  the final policy document within the next month and I am quite happy to hear  the views of elected representatives on it. The draft speed management policy  is based on guidance produced by the Department for Transport and the regional  Administrations. That guidance was subject to public consultation in 2009 and,  based on the comments submitted, received considerable support. The new policy  will also contain the latest thinking on encouraging a greater take-up of 20  mph limits and zones in residential areas.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Belfast  Rapid Transit System</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">5. <span class="BoldText">Mr B Wilson</span> asked the Minister for Regional Development why the public consultation on the  preferred routes for the Belfast  rapid transit system is being deferred until after the primary legislation has  completed its Assembly stages. (AQO 896/10<a name="AQO896/10" id="AQO896/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">The Minister for Regional  Development</span>: My Department sought advice from a number of sources,  including the Office of the Legislative Counsel and the Departmental  Solicitor&rsquo;s Office, on the timelines for the proposed rapid-transit legislation.  Those discussions identified the need for accurate timetabling of legislation  to enable it to be delivered within the mandate of this Assembly. In addition,  there was a possibility of confusion arising if the public were also being  consulted on the details of route alignment options during the enabling  legislation process.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As a result, my Department decided not to engage with the  public on route options until early 2011. That will also allow greater detail  on route options to be made available to the public during the consultation  phase. Belfast  rapid transit is a key priority in the Programme for Government and in the  investment strategy, and it is the subject of an important commitment from me  and the Department.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">Mr B Wilson</span>: I thank the  Minister for his response. I am disappointed, because there seems to be some  slippage. I hope that that does not reflect commitment to the rapid-transit  project. When the legislation comes to the Assembly, will it include route  options beyond the three that we have already?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">The Minister for Regional Development</span>:  I assure Members that there has been no slippage. The reason why we have held  back the consultation on route options is so as not to confuse people. The  legislation coming before the Assembly is enabling legislation, and it does not  specify routes. It does not even specify Belfast.  The legislation will enable the roll-out of rapid transit anywhere in the  North.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A number of route options are being looked at as part of  the three pilot schemes. Further work to be done prior to the consultation will  allow for greater information to be provided on the pros and cons of each of  the route options.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, the scheme is a priority for me. It is a key  part of the Programme for Government and a priority for the Department. I do  not see there being any slippage.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">Mr Burns</span>: Will the Minister  assure the House that it will be possible for the routes selected for the  scheme to be easily upgraded, so that they can serve commuter towns outside Belfast in the future?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">The Minister for Regional  Development</span>: The pilot routes that we are looking at will serve the Belfast area. They will  not serve rural areas or other towns. The enabling legislation that is being  brought forward applies to anywhere. It is not location specific.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If the Member had looked at the report by Atkins and the  follow-up publications, he would have seen that three route options are being  looked at specifically as part of the pilot scheme, which will be developed in  the first instance.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Roads Service: Compensation Claims</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">6. <span class="BoldText">Mr Hamilton</span> asked  the Minister for Regional Development how many pothole-related claims were made  against Roads Service in 2008-09 and 2009-2010 to date; and the total  compensation paid during each period. (AQO 897/10<a name="AQO897/10" id="AQO897/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">The Minister for Regional  Development</span>: In 2008-09, my Department&rsquo;s central claims unit received  1,472 pothole-related claims. The figure for 2009-2010, up to 26 February 2010,  is 1,530. In 2008-09, &pound;371,979.66 was paid in compensation for pothole-related  claims. The corresponding figure for 2009-2010, up to the end of February 2010,  is &pound;382,295.83. As it takes a minimum of a few months to investigate and  conclude compensation claims, the amount of compensation paid in any year will  not relate solely to claims received in that year.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">Mr Hamilton</span>: I thank the  Minister for his reply. Given that my question was the second one that he  received about potholes today, and given the high level of pothole-related  claims and the quantity of money paid out over the past number of years, what  roll-out has there been by Roads Service of the Jetpatcher vehicle, which is  immensely popular in Great Britain, not just because it fills in potholes very  quickly but because it is cost-effective?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">The Minister for Regional  Development</span>: The jet-patching vehicle is used extensively here, and, as  I said in response to earlier questions on structural maintenance, an  additional &pound;16<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; ">&#8729;</span>6 million has  been allocated to that area since January. However, that money, which has been  allocated across the divisions, still does not bring us to the level that is  required for structural maintenance this year. Roads Service, the Department  and I continue to argue that we need the required funds for structural  maintenance to ensure that we not only patch the roads but repair their full  structure. Some of the methods that are used to keep the roads safe are  effective in the immediate term. However, in the longer term, ongoing  structural damage will cause even greater problems.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">Mr Cree</span>: Is the Minister  satisfied with the speed with which Roads Service carries out repairs, and is  there scope for contracting more small firms to assist with the work?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">The Minister for Regional  Development</span>: I am sure that areas for improvement can be found in any  service. However, few organisations can take receipt of &pound;16 million in January,  spread it across their divisions on a need basis and spend it before the end of  the financial year. Roads Service is used to spending properly the money that  it receives, and it responds as quickly as it can.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member will know &mdash; as all Members, whether they  represent rural or urban constituencies, will know &mdash; that this year&rsquo;s cold  spell has had a very severe effect on roads. Demand on Roads Service to fix  roads has been high, and it approaches that on a priority basis. It found that  it has enough resources at its disposal to spend that money.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">Mr McCarthy</span>: Will the  Minister assure the House that the &pound;16 million that we have heard so much about  this afternoon will be used to fill in the massive number of potholes in rural  areas? I raised that matter with Sammy Wilson last week, and he was doubtful  whether the money will be spent on such repairs.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">The Minister for Regional  Development</span>: Perhaps he was hopeful rather than doubtful because he  wants the money back. However, from the information that I have received, I  understand that Roads Service fully intends to use the money for that purpose.  Roads Service has experience of receiving money that other Departments have not  spent late in the financial year, and it has always been good at ensuring that  that money is spread equitably across all divisions and put to use very quickly  on roads. I have no doubt that, were it available, much more money could be  spent on roads. However, the intention is, based on any evidence that I have  seen to date, that Roads Service will spend the money that was made available  in the December monitoring round.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">Mr Speaker</span>: Question 7 has  been withdrawn.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Residential Car Parking</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">8. <span class="BoldText">Mr Durkan</span> asked  the Minister for Regional Development for an outline of progress on residential  parking schemes. (AQO 899/10<a name="AQO899/10" id="AQO899/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">The Minister for Regional  Development</span>: With your permission, Mr Speaker, I had intended to take  questions 7 and 8 together. Nonetheless, my response will cover both  eventualities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">First, I will provide an update on the progress of  residential parking schemes in general. Members will be aware that I amended  the policy on the introduction of residents&rsquo; parking schemes to address  residents&rsquo; concerns during the first phase of residents&rsquo; parking schemes in Belfast. However,  following the most recent public consultation exercise, those schemes have  again failed to obtain the support required to allow them to be implemented.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In response to that and to subsequent requests from elected  representatives for further consideration, I have decided to re-engage with the  local community in three areas, namely Barrack Street, the Markets East and the  Markets West. Officials from Roads Service will have further meetings with  community representatives to discuss the issue and to gauge the likely support  for our proposals. If the response is positive and the community  representatives agree to promote the benefits of the scheme actively, I will  instruct Roads Service to resurvey the residents to confirm whether support is  sufficient with a view to finalising details and implementing the schemes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, I have asked officials to begin to engage with  residents in the lower Malone and Stranmillis areas of Belfast with the intention of developing  schemes. Following meetings with residents and representatives from Queen&rsquo;s  University, my Department has established a joint group to consider parking  management in the lower Malone area. The group will soon produce a short report  that sets out a range of options. There are plans to pilot similar schemes in  other towns, and a consultation exercise has just been successfully completed  on a proposal for a scheme in the Bogside area of Derry,  and details are being finalised in preparation for the necessary legislative  procedures.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">Mr Durkan</span>: The Minister  will be aware that some people who have been through the pilots and  consultations find them convoluted. However, people who have a clear demand for  such schemes are particularly frustrated, not least, as the Minister is well  aware, those in Aberfoyle Crescent  and Aberfoyle Crescent South  in Derry and in Clarence Avenue and Lawrence Hill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Can the Minister give the people in those areas any hope  that his Department will move to accede to their reasonable demands, given the  pressures that they face?</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: My colleague beside me, and others in Derry, have raised the issue of the Aberfoyle residents  on a number of occasions, and I am aware of it. The Member will know that the  situation there is different from that in which all-day commuter parking  prevents people from parking outside their own houses. In Aberfoyle and in some  parts of the lower Malone area of Belfast,  people have driveways, so it is not the case that they cannot park outside  their homes. The difficulty lies in getting access to and from their homes,  which is the case in and around the Magee campus. I have assured the people  there, and the elected representatives who have written to me, that when the  pilot scheme is launched in the Bogside, we can look clearly and more urgently  at the situation in Aberfoyle, and at the report on a similar problem in the  lower Malone area relating to parking at Queen&rsquo;s University. That situation  does not prevent people from parking outside their own doors, but it creates  hazards and difficulties for people who have driveways to park in. There may be  lessons from that situation that can be applied in the Magee area.</p>

    <p class="H4StageHeading">Second Stage</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">Ms Purvis</span>: I beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That the Second Stage of the Local Government  (Disqualification) (Amendment) Bill <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[NIA 7/09]</span></span> be agreed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In accordance with Standing Order 32, I would like to  outline the general principles of the Bill. The purpose of the Bill is to end  the practice of dual mandates between the Assembly and local district councils.  Dual mandates occur when an individual holds more than one level of elected  public office at the same time. The Bill will disqualify any individual who is  elected, appointed or otherwise selected as a local councillor from holding the  position of MLA. The Bill will come into effect at the next local district  elections after Royal Assent is granted. According to the calendar, that will  be the local elections anticipated in 2011.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to note that the Bill does not create any  new prohibitions on candidacy. It will not prevent an individual from standing  for a local council and the Assembly at the same time, if, for example, local  and Assembly elections were to be held on the same day. Although that form of  spreading the odds, as it were, was distasteful to some who responded to the  public consultation on the Bill, most felt that creating a prohibition to stand  limited choice and the principles of political participation. If a sitting  councillor stands for, and is elected to, the Assembly, or vice versa, when  local and Assembly elections are held on different dates, that individual will  be disqualified from holding the local council seat.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That is the extent of the legislation. I know that,  customarily, Members are given four weeks to familiarise themselves with new  legislation. It is my sincere hope that it did not take as long to read through  the three clauses that comprise the Bill. Its brevity speaks to its  effectiveness, and it says exactly what it will do.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The original proposal for the legislation contained two  additional provisions: one would have changed the way in which vacant seats are  filled in local councils outside an election to mirror the arrangements that  are in place for the Assembly; the other would have created a body to  co-ordinate the work of local and regional government. The provisions for local  council vacancies would have permitted political parties to co-opt another  party member into a council seat if that seat were made vacant by the departure  of a party member. That course of action would prevent costly by-elections,  ensure that the make-up of local councils reflected the mandates given by the  voters on the day of the election, and give political parties the opportunity  to prepare new individuals for the work of government. However, that was deemed  to be an excepted matter and that proposal was subsequently removed.  Nonetheless, I am pleased to see that that issue is being addressed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Following the consultation on filling vacancies in local  councils, Minister Paul Goggins recently laid a Bill at Westminster that will alter the manner in  which vacancies in local councils are filled to match the arrangements that are  in place in the Assembly. It is hoped that that will be completed by the end of  March.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The final provision of the original proposal, the  co-ordination body, was designed to ensure effective communication,  complementary efforts, and shared visions and agenda between local and regional  government, particularly if the review of public administration is to be  realised and councils are to be given enhanced responsibilities. Such systems  are used in a number of countries, including Wales  and Australia,  where dual mandates are not the norm. It would also address the assertion that  there are benefits in efficiency and information flow when the same people are  MLAs and local councillors. However, efficiencies should not have to rely on  individual personalities and capabilities; they should be systemic. Any value  in that arrangement is outweighed by larger more serious problems that occur  when the flow of information and access to government are limited to a small,  narrow pool of individuals.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The wording in the proposed Bill about the co-ordination  body was ultimately removed when the Environment Minister informed me of his  intention to bring proposals to the Executive to create such a body. I look  forward to seeing that progress.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The rationale behind the Bill is simple but compelling. The  legislation is about making the principles of good governance part not only of  the rules but of the dominant culture of politics in Northern Ireland. That means making  inclusion, transparency and accountability part of the daily operating  principles of our governing structures and promoting regulations that ensure  that decisions that are made by elected officials are taken with the needs and  interests of the public first. It means ensuring that this nascent Assembly  strives to achieve the gold standard for good governance and public  representation, even when it is personally inconvenient or uncomfortable for  those elected to the House. This is a post-conflict Government, and instilling  the highest values in all that we do is paramount not just to having peace but  to keeping it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Northern Ireland  has the worst record in the UK  and one of the worst in Europe on dual  mandates. Out of 108 Members of the Assembly, 67 hold mandates as local  councillors. That equates to 62% &mdash; the vast majority. That is a problem. Having  power, decision-making and public representation concentrated among the same  limited number of people is preventing the growth of a culture of inclusion,  transparency and openness. Rather than working to bring new people in, we are  striving to maintain a system that keeps new people out. That has been the  dominant political culture in Northern    Ireland for decades. Ending dual mandates  has the potential to bring at least 67 new voices into our government  structures, give or take what actually happens with the review of public  administration. It will force us, the political parties, which are meant to be  a mechanism for public expression, to work harder at reaching out to the  public, to do a better job appealing to and involving more people, and to  present the work of elected government as worthwhile and valuable.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is an opportunity to bring in under-represented  voices with new recruits. Of the 67 Members holding dual mandates, 55 are men.  That is to say that 88% of dual mandates between the Assembly and local  government are held by men. That highlights the startlingly low number of women  in the House, despite the leadership of women in every other aspect of our  society. The end of dual mandates would create an opportunity for all parties  to bring women into decision-making positions. The same is true for young  people, those with disabilities, members of minority ethnic communities and  those from disadvantaged social and economic backgrounds. All those groups make  real contributions to our communities every day, but are sadly  under-represented in our elected bodies.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When government more accurately reflects the make-up of its  population, it delivers better policy, more accountable governance and  engenders higher levels of public confidence. Confidence is a key component of  this legislation. Public sentiment towards the Assembly sometimes fluctuates  between frustration and fury. This body is too often perceived as bickering,  ineffective and self-interested. I hope that those Members of the Assembly who  are genuinely concerned with public confidence will see the Bill as an  opportunity to demonstrate that the Assembly puts the interests of people first  and that Assembly Members are willing to make what may seem like personal  sacrifices in the name of better, more transparent and participatory  government.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is also the issue of conflict of interest, which  could potentially become even more of a concern if the review of public  administration comes into effect and councils are given enhanced  responsibilities. It is a fact that different levels of government make  decisions about each other. Indeed, there have been prime examples of potential  conflicts of interest in the past year in particular. Members of the Assembly  took on ministerial portfolios and retained their seats as local councillors.  They went on to be involved in decisions that undeniably violated standards for  transparency in government decision-making.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If councils are given enhanced responsibilities under the  changes proposed in the review of public administration (RPA), it will be much  more difficult to make the case that the roles of MLA and councillor are  complementary rather than conflicting. That was clear in the responses to the  public consultation on the Bill. The members of the public who responded do not  see the roles of councillor and MLA as complementary. Rather, they see one  individual taking both roles as excessive and unwarranted. Local councillors  also raised concerns and indicated their support for an end to dual mandates.  One councillor stated that, on a number of occasions, he or she had worked diligently  on an initiative to benefit the local area only to have those efforts derailed  by MLAs who are also councillors working to a different agenda.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The consultation solicited the opinions of more than 140  organisations and individuals on the matter of dual mandates. All responses  favoured an end to the practice, and only one objection was raised by a local  council. That concern is that the legislation should not create barriers or  restrictions that make it difficult for elected officials to move from local  government to regional government to national government, and so on. The idea  is that local government can, of course, provide upcoming politicians and  political leaders with important experience of how governance works. I am  sensitive and sympathetic to that argument, and the Bill has been intentionally  constructed so as not to diminish or inhibit the importance of local government  as a training ground or stepping stone to higher office.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The single consultation response in opposition to the  proposal suggests that ending dual mandates should be done voluntarily by  political parties; I could not agree more. That is what happened in Scotland, Wales  and many other societies in which dual mandates are aberrant, and that should  be the case in Northern    Ireland as well. However, we see little  meaningful progress towards the achievement of a voluntary end to dual  mandates.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">All the parties in the Chamber have put on record that they  favour an end to dual mandates, and most have held that position for some time.  However, little has happened to make it a reality. I welcome the small steps  that have been taken recently, but the deadline for full implementation keeps  moving, or parties seem to take a step forward in ending dual mandates only to  take a big step backwards. Therefore, an achievable reform remains merely  aspirational, and our pace towards political maturity remains painfully slow.  Legislating for the change will create a firm deadline for parties to work to.  It will make the change irreversible and set an important, permanent standard  and principle for our democracy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Outside the consultation, others have argued that although  they see a case for the prohibition of dual mandates between the Assembly and  Westminster because both are full-time jobs, they find the case for ending dual  mandates that concern the Assembly and local councils less compelling. Those  jobs are viewed as complementary, and the workload at council level is regarded  as decidedly part-time.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Allow me to make it clear: although elected Members may see  a difference between those two levels of government, the public do not. The  consultation found no perception of difference between those levels of  government and a strong sense that individuals who have been selected for the  privilege of public office should focus fully on doing that job well no matter  what, rather than seeking to use the position to amass further power, as that  can give the appearance that individuals are working harder for personal gain than  for the representation of the public.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The consultation also indicates that the public believes  that a higher standard of conduct is required when a person holds public office  and is in receipt of public money; that it is not appropriate for one person to  draw multiple salaries as an elected official; and that there is a degree of  unfairness in elected officials holding more than one elected position at a  time when many of those whom they represent are losing or struggling to hold on  to the only job that they have.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Let me be clear that the perceived problem is with dual  mandates, or holding more than one elected position, and not with  double-jobbing whereby a person may hold an elected position as well another  job that may also be supported by public funds, such as a doctor or a teacher.  The difference in those cases of drawing two salaries from the public purse &mdash;  for example, someone who is a doctor or a teacher and a local councillor, as  distinct from someone who is an MLA and a councillor &mdash; is partially one of  perception. The voters know what a doctor or a teacher does on the job. They  know how such individuals earn their money and what they do to earn it. They understand  the contribution that those professionals make to society, the essential nature  of their work and how to hold them to account if they have a problem or  complaint with their work. The same is not true of elected officials. Ask  anyone on the street what an MLA or councillor does all day, and you will be  hard pressed to get a positive answer. The dominant image involves attending  receptions, making speeches, and that is about all.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Ask voters what can be done if they have a problem with, or  a complaint against, an elected official and you will encounter an immense  level of frustration and, possibly, a few adjectives unfit for children&rsquo;s ears.  Whether or not that perception is accurate, voters consider most elected  officials to be less effective, less essential and less accountable than their  doctor or teacher. When it comes to good governance, perception is important.  Voters perceive a real conflict with dual mandates, and, therefore, there is  one.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The other problem is the concentration of power and decision-making  in the hands of a few, at a time when we need new people with good ideas to  refresh and revitalise our political institutions and leadership. We tend to  overvalue experience in that assessment, and want to keep or reward people who  have been involved in politics for a long time. Many politicians and political  leaders deserve accolades for their courage and involvement over the years, but  let us not pretend that all experience is valuable, or that experience has  always meant that positive contributions are made.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have also heard proponents of the status quo argue that  the voters elect the folks with dual mandates and that, therefore, the voters  do not mind. The logic is that if the voters did not want those people to be  elected, they would not vote for them. That suggestion is both inaccurate and  disingenuous. Political parties, not voters, select who will be on the ballot  paper on election day, and whom the voters get to select. The parties then  appeal to the voters, in the name of party loyalty, to support their candidates  on the ticket. The parties put forward the double-dippers, not the voters, and  the parties lobby the voters to support the double-dippers. In such a  situation, do voters have a genuine freedom of choice?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Purvis</strong>:  No. You are up next.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Dissenting opinions are the exception. I have received  extensive expressions of support for this legislation, not only through the  public consultation but from Members, and I am grateful for that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have discussed the mechanisms for implementation in  detail with several Members. Some suggested the addition of a waiting period or  a period of grace after an election to allow an individual who may have been  elected to both the Assembly and to local office to decide which seat he or she  will take up, and to allow the party to decide whom to co-opt into the vacant  seat. I am sympathetic to that idea, and it was considered in the early stages  of drafting the Bill. However, it was not incorporated because it will add complexities  and delays to newly elected bodies when they start their work. I believe that Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  political parties have the strategic capacity to plan for those decisions well  in advance of election day.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Another Member expressed the concern that parties will  intentionally place high-profile individuals on the ballot for local elections  for the sole purpose of increasing the party&rsquo;s vote and that they will then  allow that person to be disqualified to co-opt a lesser-known individual on to  that seat. Indeed, that is a possibility, and any system, if it is approached  with cynicism, is open to abuse. However, voters would also be aware that any  individual who is in receipt of a dual mandate will have to surrender one of  those seats, and voters may have a sense of what is coming before they cast  their votes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some responses to the proposed legislation were a bit more  disconcerting. More than one Member argued that it is necessary to retain dual  mandates as a form of employment insurance in case the Assembly collapses. That  is troubling on a number of levels. For the past few years, as the economic  downturn has hit, thousands of our citizens have been made redundant without  such a luxury as employment insurance. If the Assembly falls, or if an election  is lost, Members should find themselves in exactly the same situation as any  member of the public who is faced with redundancy. That argument also has an  impact on public confidence, in that if Members are not confident about the  continuation of the Assembly, how can we expect the public to have confidence  in it? Ending dual mandates is an indication of our confidence that the  Assembly is here to stay.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank Members for their time and for their consideration  of the Bill. I hope that its implications and intentions are compelling and  convincing and that they match the system of values that they feel should be in  place in Northern Ireland  politics. I am grateful to those members of the Assembly secretariat who have  been extraordinarily helpful throughout the process, which began in December  2008. I am also grateful to those Members who have been supportive of the Bill  and of the process of political growth and maturation to which the Assembly  strives to make a real contribution.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also offer gratitude to those politicians who have  dedicated years to public service even in the darkest and most desperate times.  Let us ensure that the experience of the past few decades and the contributions  that those individuals made are used as lessons in moving forward.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  declare an interest as a member of North Down Borough Council and as a  vice-president of the Northern Ireland Local Government Association. However, I  will not make my remarks in either capacity.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member who proposed the legislation congratulated the  work that councillors have done over the years, and I echo those comments. Her  remarks are true of councillors of all parties in the Chamber. There was  virtually no money at all involved in being in local government, particularly  in the 1970s, 1980s and into the 1990s, so for many years, people became  involved for reasons other than financial reward. Even at present, the public  responsibility that comes with being involved with local government is not  particularly well paid. Many councillors acted more out of a sense of service  and for no real remuneration. We should also remember that elected  representatives from across the political divide, particularly councillors,  were on the front line of democracy at the height of the Troubles. Indeed,  members from different parties paid the supreme sacrifice, being murdered  during the Troubles. Therefore, we need to put this issue into context and  ensure that we do not treat it lightly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also thank the Member for consulting with each party  about the proposed legislation. We had a productive session, if not one in  which we necessarily saw eye to eye. However, the Member had a useful exchange  of views with our party and with other parties, and we thank her for taking the  time to speak to the parties.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I understand, at least in theory, some of the thinking  behind examining the real issue of public confidence in the system. The Member  peppered much of what she said with statements about public perception. We need  to move beyond perception and towards reality. It is not simply a question of  how we deal with issues of public confidence or perceptions of roles; rather,  we must ensure that we offer leadership and that we do the right thing.  Although the DUP has sympathy with the Bill&rsquo;s general thrust, we have a number  of reservations, which I will outline.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have a philosophical difficulty with the legislation. The  Member does not support the argument that it is up to the people to decide whom  their representatives will be. She said that people do not have a fair chance  to vote for whom they want to represent them. I reject that analysis. Parties  should voluntarily tackle the issue of double-jobbing, because they decide who  runs for them and where. The public then determine whether candidates are right  for particular areas. Similarly, I have a philosophical problem with term  limits in America,  where there is a cut-off point after which people are not entitled to run  again. Ultimately, it is up to the people to choose.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member told us that the public, because they are given  the choice of voting only for the particular incumbent, who happens to be an  MLA, do not really have a fair choice. The larger parties provide a slate of  candidates for whom people have the opportunity to vote. I acknowledge that the  smaller parties may be an exception. Nine times out of 10 or more, however,  people vote for the person whom they believe to have the most experience.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are occasions when incumbency can be a major  detraction. I suspect that Mr Farry will speak about that later. I am old  enough to remember a time in North Down &mdash; I think that it was in 1989 &mdash; when  the council was very unpopular, owing to decisions that it had made. On that  occasion, people voted with their feet. As a result of a backlash against the  council, parties chose new candidates ahead of councillors who had served for a  number of terms. Fundamentally, however, people judge whether to back  incumbents or MLAs. Equally, they can decide that they want to see a fresh face  or to elect someone who is unencumbered by the pressures of being an MLA. That  is a choice for the electorate to make. People are not stupid.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member mentioned voluntary movement by parties. There  has been a certain level of voluntary movement, although it has been quite  slow. The DUP is committed to reducing the number of its MLAs who are also  councillors. Sammy Wilson recently stood down from Belfast City Council and  Peter Robinson from Castlereagh Borough Council.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Up until now, co-options in this proportional  representation (PR) system have been possible only when the council unanimously  agrees to them, so political parties have been able to try to gain an advantage  by forcing a by-election. All parties have probably been guilty of attempting  that at some stage, and I do not claim sainthood on behalf of my party. Fortunately,  however, there has been greater movement away from doing that. When Peter  O&rsquo;Hagan, the distinguished Lisburn councillor, died, a co-option was agreed. In  the past, however, we have not always been so fortunate. Parties may have  restricted some of their senior members from standing down from councils  because of the threat of a resulting by-election.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As was indicated, it was originally intended that the Bill  would allow co-option. Fortunately, events have somewhat overtaken that, and  the British Government are progressing legislation that will mean that, by the  end of the month, co-option will become automatic. That will provide some  reassurance for parties to move some of their representatives out of local  government, because, to use Lisburn as an example &mdash; a council area that, I  think, at one point, had only one nationalist seat &mdash; parties will be less  tempted to take advantage of that situation for their own party political ends.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The public perception of dual mandates was mentioned, and I  also have reservations about that. Whatever arguments and time frame are used,  comparing MPs with MLAs &mdash; clearly two full-time and, to some extent,  overlapping and complementary jobs &mdash; is not the same as comparing MLAs with  councillors. I can speak if not from a unique perspective in the House then a  slightly unusual one, in that I served purely as an MLA for some seven years.  For five years, I have served as an MLA and a councillor, whereas most Members  of the House tend to be councillors when they are first elected to the House to  serve a dual purpose. Personal experience has shown me that there is a high  level of complementarity and that the two posts marry.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My being a councillor at the same time as being an MLA has  been an advantage to me in giving me a wider perspective. That cuts both ways.  In North Down Borough Council, five of the 25 councillors are MLAs. That means  that the MLAs can bring a useful central government perspective to the council  chamber. It also means that, in reflecting local concerns and issues, I freely  admit that, as a councillor, I am much better informed as an MLA than I  previously was. On that basis, I am able to convey attitudes from the council  to the Assembly. My perspectives from the council and the Assembly have been  advantageous to me in my wider local government work, as, I suspect, they have  been to others.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I question the idea that the Bill&rsquo;s sponsor may have had at  least one disgruntled councillor complain about MLAs having different agendas  and so on. However, the idea that some brilliant local initiative can be  stymied by MLAs&rsquo; being members of a particular council does not hold water. No  council in Northern Ireland  has a majority of MLA members. In every case, councillors who are MLAs are in  the minority. Therefore, the idea that MLAs can veto council matters simply  does not add up.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have reservations about the distinction that is drawn  between the public purse and dual mandates. Anyone who has served in local  government will know that all councillors, unless retired, have other jobs. The  sponsor of the Bill may not have that perspective because, to the best of my  knowledge, she has never served in local government, so the advantages of doing  so may be lost to her. However, it is a financial necessity for all councillors  to have other jobs. I find it a little bit odd for someone to say that one can  be a councillor and a doctor or a councillor and a teacher, but one cannot be a  councillor and a professional politician. That proposition seems illogical.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are also practical reservations. Mention was made,  for example, of a situation where council and Assembly elections take place at  the same time. If, on election to the Assembly, a person automatically lost his  or her council seat, there would be certain practical implications which must  be looked at in a wider context.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Under the RPA process, which achieved cross-party agreement  among all five major parties, at the first council meeting after an election  responsibilities and key positions will be allocated, probably through d&rsquo;Hondt  or another form of proportionality, according to party strength. If people are  automatically removed from council seats, there would be two unforeseen  circumstances. First, do we weaken that party by one seat on the council? The  first council meeting after an election will probably take place before any  co-option, albeit compulsory, has taken place. There are practical difficulties  with that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, unlike the present situation, whereby in the next  few months in the run-up to the RPA a number of councillors will vacate their  seats to make way for others, if, on the same day, people vote for someone who  is running as an MLA and as a councillor &mdash; this will create a dilemma for a lot  of individuals who are not in secure seats &mdash; they may elect Joe Bloggs on a  Thursday only to find that, within a month, he is replaced by another  councillor. That is another practical difficulty. This is where the exploration  between the parties has to happen, and perhaps this is a vehicle that can be  used so that this is progressed by agreement between the parties as to the best  way forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am not claiming any particular special knowledge, but I  do not foresee the conflict of interest and friction that the proposer of the  motion suggested will exist in 2011. In my 12 years in the Assembly, that has  not been my experience. As part of the RPA process, severance arrangements will  be put in place for the many long-serving councillors who will be leaving  office. Under this Bill, in 2011 we will all be stripping out all 67  councillors who are also MLAs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There will be additional powers for councils but also a  high level of cultural change because of the division of responsibilities  between parties but also because, to take one example, when planning comes to  councils, instead of all of us who are on councils throwing rocks at the  planners and using it as a vehicle to object to particular things, we will  become judge, jury and executioner. That is going to be a huge cultural change,  and there needs to be a high level of capacity building. In 2011, will we  simply remove everyone who has served in the Assembly, along with a wide range  of serving councillors who have been there for many years? On any council, the  best team is a blend of youth and experience.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Simpson</strong>:  Yes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  hear Mr Simpson saying yes. I am not sure whether he counts himself as youthful  or experienced. I think that he was claiming both. I suspect that, in politics,  the older one gets, the higher one tends to raise the bar of what counts as  youthful.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to see new blood coming into councils, but I want  that to be balanced. That is the best way to bring people on, and the present  system affords us the opportunity to do that. The challenge, therefore, under  RPA, is to balance bringing in new talent with retaining people who have a  degree of experience in local government.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The DUP has a range of reservations about how the Bill is  drafted. Consequently, we have a degree of scepticism about it. However, we  will see whether the Bill can be improved and worked on. Therefore, if the Bill  passes its Second Stage today, we will work proactively on whatever Committee  is charged with dealing with it. From that perspective, although we have major  reservations about the Bill, which we have highlighted, we believe that it  indicates some level of motivation to rebuild public confidence. Consequently,  although we have a lot of scepticism towards the Bill, we will not divide the  House. If the Bill passes this stage, we look forward to working in Committee  to see whether something can be salvaged from it that will benefit our  democracy in Northern    Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I support the principles of the Bill.  The Bill is short and contains only three clauses, but its implementation and  outworkings will lead to proper, transparent representation in public office  and should instil confidence in local communities and the general public.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Weir talked about public perception, but he knows the  reality. Irrespective of how people try to cover over the issue of MLAs being  local councillors &mdash; the work of a councillor is presented as a part-time job &mdash;  some people still see them as two jobs. A lot of people, especially in the  construction industry, do not have a job, and in relation to the whole debacle  &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  I would like the Member to explain whether he is saying that he is opposed to  double mandates or to double-jobbing, because, in my book, there is a  fundamental difference. We listened to the proposer of the motion state that  she was opposed to double mandates. She was not opposed, for example, to a  doctor also being a councillor, but she voiced great opposition to an MLA being  a councillor. However, those of us who have been sitting on councils &mdash; some  since the early 1970s &mdash; always had another job. In fact, at that time, there  was no remuneration for councillors. Furthermore, those were the bad old days  when we were going through a horrendous period in the history of this Province.  Indeed, at that time it was not popular for someone even to put their name  forward for election, and I suspect that all parties had that difficulty.  Therefore, some of what has been said smacks a bit of jumping on the bandwagon.  Perhaps it is more popular to be in politics now than it was then. Should some  recognition not be given to that?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  For clarification, I am talking about mandates. I am responding to what Mr Weir  said. We are talking about representing the public and leading from the front.  I have spoken about the perception that is out there, and that is the point  that I am trying to get across. We recognise the good work that local councils  have done in the past; I am not arguing about that. The key point that I want  to make is about public perception.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in supported the recommendation under the review of  public administration that a Member of the Assembly cannot stand for election  under the proposed new council structures, and we believe that it is a matter  for individual parties to regulate on the issue of dual mandates. My party has  already taken steps to support the ending of dual mandates. Sinn F&eacute;in has seen  a number of local councillors &mdash; myself included, I am pleased to point out &mdash;  who have been co-opted out of local councils to give someone else that  opportunity.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In most cases, the Bill will remove the issue of conflict  of interest, which, at present, may be inhibiting the decision-making process,  and, therefore, impacting on local ratepayers and local communities, whether  people want to recognise that or not. It would address the present situation in  which a Minister who is a local councillor is legislating on planning, the  review of public administration and all other aspects of their ministerial role  and then sitting on a local council making a decision as part of a corporate  council, which may be contrary to policy or to that ministerial role.  Therefore, there can be conflicts of interest. Members should not fail to  recognise that</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  Does the Member agree that, in the argument over a potential conflict of  interest, there is a difference between someone who is both a Minister and  councillor and someone who is both a Member and a councillor, where the  position is a lot less acute? From a practical point of view, it is difficult  to find many cases of conflict of interest on that basis. Does the Member agree  that there will be occasions when conflicts of interest arise in councils? I  have been present when a person has declared a conflict of interest. An example  occurred recently in my council when a potential grant for a primary school of  which I am a governor was debated. I declared an interest and left the meeting  for the duration of the discussion. Such conflicts of interest will be taken  care of by a mandatory code of conduct, which will be put in place as part of  the review of public administration. Its objective will be to ensure that  councillors will not have conflicts of interest.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>: I  accept the Member&rsquo;s point. However, Mr Weir will be aware that, if we are  legislating for the planning process to be part of local councils, for example,  the Minister will have made that decision based on a recommendation from his  Department. If, when the new responsibilities are being rolled out in council,  the Minister is sitting as a councillor, it will not do for him merely to  declare an interest and walk out of the room.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  No, I have given way already.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is about public perception. It is not enough for the  individual merely to walk out of the room and say that he or she will not take  part in the conversation, because, in essence, the individual has sat in the  House, has gone through the legislation and knows what is there. There are  opportunities for conflicts of interest, and they need to be removed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in supports the Bill. The removal of the dual  mandate will ensure that there is public confidence, and it will lead to open  and proper representation that will be of benefit to the communities that we  represent.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  declare an interest as a serving local councillor. I commend Dawn Purvis for  the brevity of the Bill and for introducing it as a private Member&rsquo;s Bill. The  brevity of the Bill helps to concentrate our minds on the issues, without  allowing others to add red herrings. The Bill is concentrated and short, and Ms  Purvis referred to the length of the Bill in her opening speech. The Ulster  Unionist Party supports the principle of the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Northern    Ireland has suffered, perhaps more than any  other region, as a result of double, even triple, mandates. With regard to the  regional assemblies and Westminster,  I understand that it is only the First Minister in the Scottish Parliament who  retains a double mandate, and no Members of the Welsh Assembly hold double  mandates. The number of MSPs and Welsh Assembly Members who are also local  councillors is in single figures.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Can an individual effectively serve on a council, in a  fully functioning Assembly and even at ministerial level at the same time? At  the same time, can they effectively participate at Westminster, in their local Assembly and in  their local council? Or are they in danger of giving the perception that they  are active on all three but are not effective in any of them? There is a danger  that, the thinner individuals spread themselves, the more they will simply  cover a number of issues fleetingly. Dual mandates may give huge office cost  allowances that allow one&rsquo;s staff to pump out press releases, but, in reality,  the public representative can be in only one place at one time and can deal  with only one issue at one time.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Does the Member think that his father did a poor job as an MP and a councillor,  given that he could be in only one place at a time?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  was referring to the situation that may have occurred in the past and to the  things that may have happened. However, we have to plan to do things better in  the future, particularly in light of the super-councils, where local  councillors will have considerably increased roles. There will be increased  responsibilities. Active participation in dual mandates will become  increasingly difficult. In addition, the Ulster Unionist Party has made it  clear that our Members of Parliament will be full-time MPs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My dad served as a Member of Parliament and a councillor  for a considerable period. He did so at considerable expense to himself and his  family. If people run for election to councils, the Assembly or Parliament and  are, perhaps, also Ministers, are they ever at home? What is the cost to their  personal life? Can they be rounded individuals if they have multiple mandates?  That is another issue that must be carefully considered. I have learnt from the  past that there are dangers in trying to do too many things. Even when local  councils had limited responsibilities, there were dangers in trying to hold  down too many jobs.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  I am interested in what the Member is saying. However, I am also slightly  confused. Perhaps he will clarify his position. He has tried to explain where  he stands on dual mandates. Does he speak as Roy Beggs the Assembly Member or on behalf of  his party? He has been at pains to say, for instance, that it may not be  compatible for a Minister to also be a councillor. I understand that his  party&rsquo;s two Ministers are also councillors. Therefore, is he saying that they  will, effectively, step down? Now that his father has stepped down, the Member  seems to be saying that he would have been stepping down anyway. Was his  father, in fact, stepped down? Which was it?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  The Ulster Unionist Party&rsquo;s position is clear and will become increasingly  apparent in the forthcoming Westminster  elections. If elected, all my party&rsquo;s candidates will be full-time Members of  Parliament. They will not attempt to temporarily fly in and out of Westminster for public  relations opportunities. Any of my party&rsquo;s successful candidates will be  full-time MPs at Westminster.  That is unequivocal.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As regards future public representation, we are moving  towards super-councils that will have increased powers and responsibilities. I  foresee that, going forward, people will have individual mandates. That is a  much healthier system, which will produce more rounded individuals, decisions  and policies. Otherwise, there is a danger that individuals will live in a  political bubble. They will not understand issues in the wider world because  they are encompassed by the world of politics. If they are not in the Assembly,  they will be in their council chamber or at Westminster. There is a danger that because  they have too many meetings they will have limited time to experience real  issues and to be available for their constituents.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr W McCrea</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  have given way numerous times. I want to proceed with the rest of my comments.  I may allow someone the opportunity to intervene later.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly cannot make determinations that affect Westminster with regard  to dual mandates. However, it can take decisions about councils because they  fall under local government matters, for which the Assembly has responsibility.  It is right that the Bill concentrates on that limited area of dual mandates  between the Assembly and councils. As I said earlier, someone cannot be in two  places at once. Clearly, through the review of public administration, it is  planned that more powers will go to local government. That increased role will  place additional pressures on individual councillors.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Why is it that the some Assembly Members have poor  Committee attendance? They are meant to be full-time Assembly Members. Clearly,  that is supposed to be a full-time job that pays a full-time wage. Some  Members&rsquo; attendance is not good. Others pass in and out of meetings fleetingly  for a brief period and get marked as present.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr W McCrea</strong>:  Like yourself.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: If  the Member examines my record on both the Public Accounts Committee and the  Environment Committee, he will find that, generally, I attend meetings from  start to finish. He will also find someone who misses very few meetings. I ask  the Member to consider that and to verify what he is saying, because I think  that he will find that it is incorrect.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  am grateful to the Member for giving way. I had the privilege of serving with  him on the Finance Committee, and I can testify that he is a dedicated  attender.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Has the Member done any analysis to compare the attendance  in Committee and in the Chamber of Members who are also councillors and those  who are not? He has made the point that Members who are MLAs only seem to be  better attenders overall. I have not looked at any figures, but, anecdotally, I  do not see a pattern. I am aware of MLAs who are also councillors and who are  extremely dedicated to the Chamber and to their Committees. Has the Member done  any analysis to back up his point that an MLA without a council role is a far  better attender in the Chamber?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  am sorry, but I have not done any detailed analysis; it is merely anecdotal  evidence. However, one hears Members saying that they are going to a council  planning subcommittee and skipping part of their Assembly Committee meeting,  but, to my mind, it would need to be a major process at local government level  for me to miss my Assembly Committee. If my full-time job is being an Assembly  Member, then that is where my priority lies.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr W McCrea</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  am trying to proceed with my speech, if I may.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">(Mr Deputy Speaker <span class="Italic">[Mr McClarty]</span> in the Chair)</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Environment Minister has advised that individual  planning decisions, area plans and the wider and important issue of community  planning will devolve to local councils, and that will be a huge area of work  for local councillors. That will be on top of their existing responsibilities,  and it will place an increasingly intolerable burden on those who wish to  retain multiple mandates. As I said, there is the issue of the sort of  individuals that we are creating through the multiple mandate ability that  exists, and the situation will become even more troublesome. Councillors will  have further new responsibilities. Today, we heard about the clean  neighbourhoods and environment Bill, the provisions of which will be introduced  into local government. There are other areas of work, including regeneration  and increased local economic development roles, which will enable local  councillors to have a greater involvement in improving their communities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clearly, a change point is coming with the local government  reorganisation that is planned for 2011. That presents an opportune time to  bring about that change. I appreciate the wording that the Member has included  in the Bill, in that that would coincide with the next local government  elections and, again, that is the right sort of ballpark.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At this early stage, I flag up the precise trigger  mechanism. The Member who presented the Bill indicated that the chosen  mechanism came from the consultation. However, I have some concern about  allowing someone to be nominated and to go forward for election and then to be  dismissed. If that person were an independent and was unable to nominate  someone else in the process, another election might be required. Therefore,  there is a danger of public moneys being wasted. I would be looking to see  whether there could be a better mechanism, and I would be happy to engage with  the Member and others to try to come up with a more appropriate trigger  mechanism if it is available.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Why is there a need to legislate? It must be remembered  that MPs and MLAs have office cost allowances, and that may be why they are  popular at local government level. They have public resources, and they have a  secretary and other staff who can assist them, which gives them a significant  advantage over other public representatives who may be councillors only. MPs  and MLAs have public resources that strengthen their position, and I accept  that that would apply to me as it does to others. Is it appropriate for that to  continue, or should we open the system up and no longer allow power to be  concentrated in limited hands?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a danger when those who are responsible for policy  development, and who may even control Departments, also work at a local council  level on individual planning applications. We have seen in recent times the  difficulties with planning and developers because of power being concentrated  in too few hands and those individuals being led astray and ignoring the Nolan  principles.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is unfortunate that that has been the case, but the  likelihood of that happening would be lessened if dual mandates came to an end,  because there would not be councillors who were also Assembly Members and MPs.  The concentration of power and the concentration of attention from planning  officials would not be there to the same extent. They would have to appreciate  that there were a range of views.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As others said, we even have a ridiculous situation ongoing  in the Assembly in that the Minister who is responsible for local government,  planning, boundaries and the RPA process continues to be a local councillor.  What an impossible situation that we put our officials in. Take, for example, a  planning official who gets lobbied by a Minister wearing a different hat.  Officials can easily get confused about who they are to please. Are they to  please the planning Minister or to consistently work according to the policies  that have been developed over time? Which hat is the Minister wearing when he  writes to and lobbies an official on an issue? We are placing our civil  servants in an impossible situation when there is a dual mandate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On 31 March 2008, Minister Foster said:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;I intend to work with colleagues in the Northern Ireland  Office in order to introduce legislative proposals to end the dual mandate of  those councillors who are also Members of the Assembly and/or Parliament.&rdquo; &mdash;  [Official Report, Bound Volume 29, p3, col 1].</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That was almost two years ago. In the intervening  time, there was a new Minister, who apparently adopted a different policy, and  was not minded to end the dual mandate. Now we have another Minister, Minister  Poots, and I have yet to hear where he stands on the issue. There was certainly  a clear commitment given by the Minister of the Environment in March 2008, and  I am not aware of how the issue has progressed since then. It appears to me  that some may simply have made some of their comments at the height of the  expenses row, just as Peter Robinson promised the end of dual mandates at one  point during that row, only to roll back a few months later when some members  of his party decided that they were not ending their dual mandates when the  heat was off.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A commitment was made to address the issue, yet I am not  aware of anything coming forward from the Department. That is why I am grateful  to Dawn Purvis for bringing forward the private Members&rsquo; legislation. It is  clear that some will need to be weaned off their dual mandates, which is why I  am happy to support the principle of the Bill. It is clear that we must move  forward with a mechanism that will increase transparency and accountability and  give the public confidence in how democratic politics work. I support the  principle of the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I thank the Member for bringing forward the legislation, which the SDLP can broadly  support. However, we have some concerns, which I will try to outline during my  contribution. It is right and fitting that the Member pointed out that today is  International Women&rsquo;s Day. There is a real need for all political parties to  have representation that more truly reflects the community at large, and we all  know that more than 51% of the community is female. I also look forward to a  greater participation of representatives from ethnic minorities. If we were to  see such changes across the political parties, it would all add to the rich  diversity of this House and others.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also support the Member in saying that there is a need to  grow the next generation of political representatives, and I pay tribute to all  those who stood for office over many years when it was not easy to do so and  when there was nothing to be gained financially. In fact, it often cost people  money to be representatives. Our party thanks the many people who allowed their  names to go forward for election to local councils, which, as we all know, were  the only democratic platforms for people in the North at one point. That must  be recognised. There is a real need for greater participation in democracy in Northern Ireland,  and local councils provide good grounding and are good places in which people  can cut their teeth in representational politics.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, a number of DUP Members who spoke have left  the Chamber. They seemed to be rolling back from their position. Mr Weir said  that some of Ms Purvis&rsquo; comments were a little bit odd. I found some of Mr  Weir&rsquo;s comments to be a little bit odd, given the fact that, as Mr Beggs said,  the DUP was categoric in its wish to end dual mandates and that it had said  that it would do so by the end of last year. Many Members of the House are MPs  and councillors and, as others have pointed out, some are also Ministers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am grateful to Mr Beggs for sourcing the comments of the  former Environment Minister Arlene Foster who clearly saw that there was a  conflict of interests between her roles as councillor and as Minister with  responsibility for local government, and she stood down. The fact that she  ended up running for election to Fermanagh District Council was a little bit  odd, but we are where we are.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Over recent months, the SDLP has made moves to end dual  mandates. We have done so in areas where we know that there will not be the  expensive necessity of by-elections. Mr Weir mentioned the co-option to Lisburn  City Council following the death of Councillor Peter O&rsquo;Hagan. We are grateful  to the councillors on Craigavon Borough Council, who, following the death of my  esteemed colleague Councillor Ignatius Fox, allowed for a co-option. That pays  tribute to their contributions in local government during many years in the  wilderness.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As we all know, legislation is going through Westminster that will do  away with the argument that many have tried to articulate about by-elections,  co-options and expense. That will take the ground from under many Members.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Ms Purvis said that experience is overvalued. I support the  need for youth and experience, but, in some cases, people went to council  chambers to oppose something rather than to vote for it. Many people should ask  themselves about their records in local councils. Did they represent their  communities well and make the councils better places for everyone, or did the  old slogan, &ldquo;what we have we hold&rdquo; prevail in many council chambers?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Boylan said that the wider public had a perception about  politicians and dual mandates. That is true, but, unfortunately, the issue has  been viewed as being a plague on all our houses, and each of us has a huge  piece of work to do to overcome that. Although that was highlighted initially  during the expenses row that began at Westminster,  it had an effect on the North. The SDLP wants to end dual mandates. We want to  grow the next generation of politicians, but we want to consider closely the  Local Government (Disqualification) (Amendment) Bill. In our private  discussions with Ms Purvis we said that when the Bill is scrutinised at  Committee Stage we will discuss further the period of grace and whether a local  councillor who stood for election to the Assembly would have to stand down in  advance of the election or after it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP broadly supports the Bill, but other parties are  rolling back from the positions that they stated last year. I do not accept Mr  Weir&rsquo;s arguments; I find many of them a little bit odd. There is a real need to  encourage more people to come into councils and into representational politics.  However, that will require attitudinal changes, because, unfortunately, very  few people put their name forward, even in today&rsquo;s relatively peaceful times.  There is a question mark over why that is the case.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I know that some Members of this House are also Members of  the House of Lords. What barriers and dilemmas do they face in their  decision-making? Perhaps there is no conflict, but many people will wonder what  is going on in that regard.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to address the issue of people finding jobs as  councillors. When I started out as a local councillor, I also worked full-time  and raised a very young family, and I do not think that people were confused  about what I did. The role of local councillor has always been seen as a  voluntary role that people never made much money from. After RPA, there may be  better salary provision for local councillors, but the scenario will have  changed by then because local councils will have additional powers and  responsibilities, so such a move would be right and fitting.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although the SDLP broadly welcomes the Bill, we have some  concerns, and we may seek to either table amendments or, at least, seek  clarifications from Ms Purvis at a later stage.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  declare an interest as member of North Down Borough Council.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party also has considerable reservations about  the Bill. Indeed, we view it as a populist measure that is set in the context  of wider concerns about conduct in public life that exist at the moment. We  believe that the issue is a soft target in comparison with some of the more  difficult and pressing issues that we face in re-establishing public confidence  in elected representatives. Like others, we will not divide the House at this  stage, but we will consider the Bill at its subsequent Committee Stage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are two issues to consider in discussing the  principles of the Bill. The first issue is whether the dual mandate of those  serving as both a councillor and an MLA is a problem. The second is whether it  is appropriate to legislate on that, if it is, indeed, a problem. I will deal  with the second issue first. Given that there has not been a full local government  election since the last Assembly election in 2007, the matter may be resolved  naturally in 2011, without the need for legislation. It may, therefore, be more  appropriate for us to consider addressing the issue of dual mandates after  2011, if we still judge it to be an issue of public concern, rather than  legislating at this stage. We should follow the principle that says that  government should not legislate to address particular circumstances that exist  at a particular time but that it should, rather, legislate to put in place  measures that are required to address problems at a more general and sustained  level. We should not, therefore, rush to legislate on issues that do not  require legislation. However, we will see how the matter develops.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member who proposed the legislation argued for the  importance of encouraging diversity among elected representatives. I am sure  that few Members disagree with that. She pointed out that the Bill would free  up a number of places for new representatives to fill. However, it is important  to set that in the context of a potential reduction in the number of  councillors after the implementation of the RPA and a campaign from some  parties in the Chamber to reduce the overall size of the Assembly. Given the  sheer number of elected representatives here, Northern Ireland is already viewed  as being over-governed in comparison with other similar jurisdictions.  Therefore, I do not think that much argument exists about the number of places  and how we can encourage diversity.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Political parties are being fundamentally challenged to  ensure that they have a diverse field of candidates. I can speak only for the  Alliance Party in that regard. We stand as an Assembly party and as a group of  councillors that have a mix of Protestants, Catholics and other religious  traditions. Almost 30% of our Assembly group is female, and a similar  percentage of females work for our councillor group. We are far from perfect,  but our figures stand up well by comparison. The Alliance Party also had the first  ethnic Chinese legislator anywhere in Europe,  of which not only the Alliance Party but the Assembly can be extremely proud.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Not that we advertise it, but we run a diverse field of  candidates based on sexual orientation also. Therefore, we feel that we achieve  diversity in what we do. However, we recognise that there is much more that we  could do.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is perhaps a slight flaw in the argument that Dawn  Purvis set out, in that the replacement of a councillor would follow the point  at which they were elected as an MLA. At that stage, under Westminster legislation, it would fall back  to the parties to fill the vacancy. Therefore, the idea that diversity would be  delivered by the electorate outside the context of the parties does not stand  up; it would be the selfsame parties that have been identified as the problem  that would be asked to fill any vacancy that arises.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a wider issue around the desirability or otherwise  of councillors being MLAs and vice versa, and that needs to be looked at in the  context of conflicts of time and of interest. I agree that there are conflicts  of interest. I can readily identify conflicts of interest for MLAs who are also  Ministers, which is a problem that has not worked itself out quickly enough. On  Belfast City Council there is a very clear, established policy of co-option.  Therefore, there is no excuse for any Minister to stay on as a councillor at  the same time as exercising Executive power.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are issues and questions around potential conflicts  of interest with respect to the current situation regarding the local  government blockage and the RPA. That being said, the conflict of interest in  Executive matters is much more acute than it is in legislative matters.  However, I concede that it is a potential issue that needs to be raised and  thought through.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Until now, the system has worked reasonably well and  Members have declared their membership of councils. I do not necessarily buy  the argument that there is a fundamental clash of interests between a regional  Assembly perspective and that of local government. On many occasions, the two  can be in harmony. That conflict has the potential to be exaggerated, although  I concede that it is an area on which we need to focus.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Conflict of time is most clearly an issue for those who are  both MPs and MLAs, both of which are quite clearly full-time elected posts. One  cannot do justice to both at the same time as full-time posts. It is further  complicated by the travel issues between Northern   Ireland and London,  and is something that will have to be resolved rather quickly. The issue has,  perhaps, evolved over time. My understanding, as someone who is still young, is  that, historically, being an MP was seen as an adjunct to a job. MPs were very  London-based, perhaps practising at the Bar in the morning and the early  afternoon before popping down to the House of Commons for the late afternoon  and evening sessions. Visits to constituencies happened on rare occasions and  with great fanfare. However, in the modern world, being an MP is very much seen  in professional terms and as a full-time post.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am disturbed that the focus is solely on the MP/MLA  aspect of double-jobbing, without wider consideration being given to the  problems that arise from MPs having other paid commitments outside Parliament.  It is there that the much greater risk for clashes of interest lies, in  particular for clashes of financial interests, but also for clashes of time. If  someone has significant outside commitments to other forms of employment or  business, then, by definition, they cannot give full account to their job as an  MP. That is certainly an area where I see the need for much greater  consideration. The same logic applies to MLAs with outside paid interests.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, there is a line to be drawn between trying to be a  full-time MLA while doing additional voluntary work, work in certain community  organisations, being a silent partner or having residual business interests,  and actively engaging in what are significant private sector pursuits.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, the position of councillor needs to be seen in a  different light. As other Members have said, councillors are not full-time  employees. Indeed, it is even debatable whether they are technically considered  as part-time employees, because they receive allowances and not salaries for  the work they do on behalf of their constituents. When proposing the Second  Stage of the Bill, Dawn Purvis flipped between viewing councillors as  jobholders and as holders of a purely elective office. Although, I fully  recognise that a councillor&rsquo;s workload can be extremely heavy and that people  come to it with a very committed attitude; nonetheless, it is not considered to  be a job, and that point applies in the rest of the UK,  the Republic of Ireland and, largely speaking, the rest  of the world. Being elected to local government is not seen as holding a job,  and we are in danger of sending out a dangerous message if we start talking  about councillors as jobholders. If that perception exists at the moment, we  should seek to correct it, not feed it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Essentially, there are two reasons why we need to make  those clarifications. First, if we treat the role of a councillor as a job,  there will be cost implications relating to the salary that will have to be  paid to them. There are already cost/benefit issues concerning the local  government aspect of the review of public administration, and moving to  fully-paid, full-time councillors, at a salary level that would need to be  competitive to attract people, would add significantly to those costs.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  The Member has talked about the definition of the role of a councillor. Should  we not be looking at this from the public&rsquo;s perspective of Assembly Members?  When people elect a person to the Assembly, they expected that person to carry  out the role exclusively and not have something, whatever that might be, as a  backdrop.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  thank Mr McCartney for his intervention. I will address that point fully in a  moment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The other implication, if we speak about the role of a  councillor as being a job, is that we will be sending out a message about the  type of people that we want to recruit to local government. We will be saying  that we want senior citizens, students, housewives or househusbands, the  unemployed or those who are otherwise economically inactive. We need to attract  professionals, businesspeople, and people at all levels of the public sector  into local government, where they can make a contribution and potentially bring  experience to decision-making.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  agree with the Member&rsquo;s point that it is beneficial for those in full-time  employment to bring their experience to local government. Does he accept that  it is also useful for professionals and those with wider interests to become an  MP? It is not possible for people who are doctors to give up their professional  status to become a full-time MP, because they only have a four- or five-year  guaranteed period of employment and, thereafter, will probably not qualify to  go back to their jobs and will have to retrain. Does the Member agree that some  amount of paid employment should be tolerated to bring in wider knowledge and  experience?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  do not disagree with that necessarily. I fully appreciate that people will want  to have the ability to return to a profession in which the law, in practice,  can move rapidly even during the course of one Westminster term.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, a balance must be struck and common sense applied.  There cannot be a situation in which people try to combine a full-time job with  being a full-time public representative. That was the sense in which I made  that comment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Other people, to keep their future options open, may wish  to keep their professional knowledge up to date and maintain a level of  participation. That same argument could be applied to local government: someone  who has a long track record in local government and is committed to local  service may enter the Assembly for a brief period of one term, or even for part  of one term, and wish to return to local government thereafter. The proposed  legislation would arbitrarily cut off that option.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To ensure that people are attracted to working in local  government, councils must hold their meetings during family friendly hours. An  attempt must also be made to avoid clashes between the normal working day and  the holding of council meetings. Proper investment must be made in childcare  for councillors. Some people whom we are trying to attract to local government  are starting families and feel that it is not feasible for them to commit to  serving the community.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I can speak from my considerable experience as an MLA and a  councillor. Unlike Peter Weir, I served as a councillor for 14 years before  being elected to the Assembly three years ago. I have, therefore, a total of 17  years&rsquo; experience in local government. When it comes to youth versus  experience, it may be that I combine the two, because I was first elected to  council at the age of 22, which is another mark of the diversity in local  government.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have found that being a councillor, particularly the way  in which it increased my knowledge of local issues, has added to my  understanding and helped me as an MLA. Councillors tend to have a much more  rounded appreciation of local issues. I recall a time when members of my party  who had been both councillors and MLAs stepped down from council. During their  subsequent experience as MLAs, they sensed that they had, to some extent, lost  touch with some aspects of local issues. In some respects, they missed having  their previous breadth of knowledge.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Equally, as an MLA I feel that I can help my council with  local issues. I do not particularly regard that as a conflict of interest,  because there is no financial gain to me or my family. Essentially, councillors  and MLAs serve the same constituents, and we try to provide them with the best  well-rounded service that we can. I do not ask people whether they approach me  in my capacity as a councillor or an MLA. People approach me because they want  to find a solution to a problem, and it is helpful that, in seeking to resolve  their problem, I can look in both directions and consider whether a regional  agency, a Minister or a local council official is best placed to help. Rather  than having to refer people to someone else who must then be briefed by me or  the constituent on the relevant first principles, I have the ability to turn  quickly in either direction to find a remedy. Thus, someone who is a councillor  and an MLA can, in certain situations, provide a more efficient local service  to his or her constituents.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">From a council perspective, our experience as councillors  means that we can have some input into the rates process. In particular, we  made a strong case for the introduction of transitionary relief in connection  with the &pound;400,000 cap on rateable values. That had a considerable impact on the  amount that people in my community had to pay through their rates. The process  of building the new Olympic swimming pool and leisure centre in Bangor has been made  smoother by councillors who are also MLAs. Their ability to engage with the  Minister in trying to overcome some of the inevitable bureaucracy that is  involved in such projects ensures that we keep to the timetable for completion.  If the project had come off the wheels and was not going to be delivered on  time, that tangible benefit to the local community would not be felt.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I recognise the point that Mr Beggs made about the problem of  people who are both MLAs and councillors sometimes giving priority to their  local government duties over their MLA duties. Councillors who are also doctors  or teachers cannot leave their day jobs to go to council meetings or council  events; their first obligation is to their employers. In our case, our employer  is the Assembly. I concede that that is a problem.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, it is fair to say that some people who are MLAs  and councillors give very dedicated and dutiful service to both aspects of  their elected mandates. I know people who are MLAs and councillors who are very  dedicated to attending and speaking in debates in the Chamber. Those MLAs have  very good voting records and good Committee attendance records, and they table  questions, develop policy and act on behalf of their constituents. Equally,  there are people who are only MLAs and who do not have the same good attendance  records or the same commitment to the job.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The 108 of us are a very mixed bunch, and it is dangerous  to make the broad generalisation that people who are only MLAs do the job  better than those who are MLAs and councillors. The evidence is, at best,  mixed. If anything, the performance figures for those who are committed to the  Assembly and a council could be surprising. As the saying goes, &ldquo;If you want  something done, ask a busy person&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I was honoured to be the Mayor of North Down during the  first term of the current Assembly mandate. I gave my full commitment to being  a Member of the Assembly during that time, and my voting record, my speaking  record, my participation in Committees and my service to my constituents would  bear that out. I also attended and hosted over 400 events as mayor, as well as  fulfilling other council duties.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Naomi Long is a Member of the Assembly and is also the Lord  Mayor of Belfast.  Very few people would disagree with me when I say that she is doing an  outstanding job on behalf of all the citizens of Belfast.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We will see where the process goes. There is a wider debate  to be held. There are issues to be considered at Committee Stage, such as  whether the disqualification should apply to all MLAs or only to those who are  Ministers. The discussion on the detail of the Bill is for another day. We look  forward with interest to the rest of the debate.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I declare an interest as a member of  Ballymoney Borough Council.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Bill and support the principles outlined in  it. As far as I am aware, this is the first time that a private Member&rsquo;s Bill  has reached Second Stage in the current mandate of the Assembly, and the Member  for East Belfast Dawn Purvis should be commended for her work. I am in the  process of putting together a private Member&rsquo;s Bill, and the amount of work  required is considerable, so I commend her and the Assembly staff involved in  compiling the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My party and I support the ending of dual mandates. Sinn  F&eacute;in supported the recommendation in the review of public administration that a  Member of the Assembly should not be allowed to stand for election to the new  council structures. We did that because membership of both could have a  negative impact on the smooth and efficient running of the Assembly and the new  councils. The Member for East Belfast Dawn Purvis is correct to argue that we  need to see new faces coming through, especially women and, as the Member for  North Down Dr Farry said, people from under-represented groups.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in has already taken, and is taking, measures to  ensure that under-represented groups in society are better represented in our  party, on our Front Benches in the Assembly and on local district councils.  Other parties, especially the Ulster Unionist Party, should take note of and  learn from that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Structures and procedures are in place in the South in the  D&aacute;il to ensure that when members of local town and county councils are elected  to that House, co-option can take place without a by-election. We should learn  from that. A number of Sinn F&eacute;in TDs in Dublin  had roles as councillors, and when they were elected to the D&aacute;il, they gave up  those posts and allowed other colleagues to take their places. I look forward  to the next council elections in the North and to an end to the parallel  holding of seats in the Assembly and on local councils.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The legislation is short and simple. Nonetheless, it will  be extremely effective. Peter Weir recognised the benefits of being a council  member as well as a Member of the Assembly. As a member of a council, I  recognise those, too. However, I know of other elected representatives in the  House who have agreed to co-opt someone of equal measure to their place on the  council. Those MLAs are aware of the detail of council work because of good  communication practices with their party colleagues on councils. That is a way  to ensure that MLAs know what is happening in their local council areas.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Like other Members, I recognise the work that councillors  have done in the past. However, local government needs a new beginning with new  responsibilities and roles. That is why local government needs a new face, of  which the dual mandate is not a part. Roy Beggs and Dolores Kelly referred to  comments that Arlene Foster made a number of years ago, when she committed to  introduce legislation to address the matter. I sincerely hope that the DUP  follows through with that message, acts in the spirit of Arlene Foster&rsquo;s words  from that time and commits to supporting the legislation to bring dual mandates  between the Assembly and councils to an end.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, I look forward to the legislation&rsquo;s  Committee Stage. It represents an important change and will help to make local  governance much more effective and robust. It offers an absolutely great  opportunity to change the make-up of councils as regards gender, race and  sexual orientation, among other things. I firmly support the principles of the  Bill and look forward to its further consideration and eventual adoption.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  I am very pleased to be able to speak on the Local Government  (Disqualification) (Amendment) Bill and congratulate Dawn Purvis for bringing  it to the House. However, before I start, I think that some of you have come  here today to listen to another debate and might like to know where we are. I  understand that three Members are left to speak. That is the good news. The bad  news is that they can speak for as long as they want. I hope that you will bear  with us.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member should refer all remarks through the Chair and should  not refer to the Galleries.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  Sorry, Mr Deputy Speaker. As I said, I am pleased to speak in the debate. I  declare an interest as a councillor on Antrim Borough Council. That is relevant  in that it is the one council in Northern Ireland that meets during  the day. I will stand down the moment that the co-option laws are enacted,  because I cannot organise it through the council myself, and I do not feel that  I can do my council job and MLA job at the same time.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am glad that we are concentrating on limiting dual  mandates; we should all concentrate on our jobs here. However, we need the  workplace experience that people outside politics provide, be they doctors,  businessmen, farmers or whatever. They could all bring their experience to bear  on what is said in this Building.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We need new blood. I salute all the experienced councillors  who worked for many years for nothing, and all those who worked through Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  more difficult years. Like Dawn Purvis, I wish to see 67 councillors change. I  want to see more women, people from ethnic backgrounds and other groups get  involved in politics. Another Member said recently that Northern Ireland  is not as divided as the politicians make it out to be. Bringing in new blood  may demonstrate that. We do not want that to happen all at once, but I am  confident that if we enact the Bill, it will not happen like that. We will work  through the process, and each party will find plenty of people willing to fill  the spaces.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill does not deal with MPs&rsquo; dual mandates but seeks to  disqualify MLAs from being elected, or being, councillors. That is why we are  focusing only on that clash of interests today. However, I have a concern that  a big name will be used simply to win an election, after which he will stand  down immediately. A common-sense balance needs to be found. For example,  someone might be elected, spend some time in the job and then stand down to let  in new blood. We should try to find a way to stop the big names from being run  all the time so that new people can be brought in behind them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Much in our electoral system needs to be changed. Such  changes are linked to this debate, and I referred to them in the recent debate  on compulsory voting. MLAs&rsquo; offices should be made more open so that MLAs can  work with councillors or publicise the fact that councillors are working from  those offices. At present, that is not legally possible. We need government  bodies and others that make it difficult for people to get interested or to  participate in politics to change their ways. We need to see a change in public  attitudes, and we need more people to get involved in politics.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A problem exists for people who, in many cases, have to  resign from their government job before standing for election. How many people  will give up a job before they know whether they will be elected? We also need  to change our approach to schools. We need to teach children about the politics  of this country and about the parties and personnel involved. Everyone in  school should know those details, not just politics students.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Weir said that we should not go on public perception  alone. However, perception is what matters, for that is what the electorate  sees of us. We know that his party does not want to see changes until 2015, and  it may even roll back from that decision. Many Members have made the point that  we need to ensure changes in the operation of dual mandates. Similarly, recent  events, from the expenses scandal to the council scandal, add to the very poor  perception that there is of politicians. All are linked.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If the RPA goes through and works, councillors will have  much more work to do. They cannot do all the new jobs that the RPA will put  their way and continue to be MLAs at the same time. Alliance Party Members  talked about not legislating when we do not need to. I was brought up to do  what I can today and not to put it off until tomorrow. As I said, it is good to  have elected representatives who have outside jobs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We were told how Minister Foster said that she was going to  legislate yet has not. I want to touch on some remarks made by the Minister of  Finance and Personnel, who said that that is a party matter and should be left  to parties to sort out. I see the vital way in which an MLA works: it is good  to be on a council and to be in touch with the public, but the onus is on us as  MLAs to work with our councillors to build good teams and to talk to one  another all the time. At present, however, we are split: one person is a  councillor, while another is an MLA. Even in instances in which people hold two  positions, they are not speaking to everyone. The onus is on us to get a good  team guideline and to work together.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Ultimately, as Mr Wilson said, the electorate will decide.  I look forward to that; Westminster  elections are coming up, and we might even have Assembly elections, when one  looks at what is going to happen tomorrow. I welcome the Bill and look forward  to everyone being honest with the electorate. The Ulster Unionist Party  supports the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>:  Mr Deputy Speaker, I assure you before I begin that this is not a party  political broadcast about my previous wonders as a mayor. Nevertheless, I  declare an interest as I have been a member of Coleraine Borough Council for  the past 33 years, which is exactly the length of time Our Lord lived on this  earth, but I am not planning to depart just yet. The Bill has a great deal of  credibility, and my party will broadly support it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Members have said, it is time to recognise that  councillors played a major role down the years in trying to keep democracy  alive. The name of Senator Paddy Wilson is recorded in one of the Rotundas in  this Building. He was one of the first public representatives to lose his life  in the dreadful times that we have gone through. As my colleague Mrs Kelly  said, legislation is going through Westminster  at the moment, to which we will look with interest. On a personal basis, I want  to implement what I say, and since it is International Women&rsquo;s Day, I can tell  Members that my replacement will be a woman.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill is important because it provides the basis for  discussion. There will be an opportunity for political parties to make whatever  amendments that they feel appropriate. The fact that we are discussing  double-jobbing means that progress has been made. When I set out in public  life, it was virtually impossible to get anyone to stand for election such was  the fear at that time. Also, there was no joy in living behind bulletproof  glass and changing one&rsquo;s route to work every day.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On a positive note, things have moved on. I hope that  today&rsquo;s discussion will be the preparation for a new generation who will,  hopefully, have things easier than some of us did in the past and that  democracy can be bedded down in a way that allows for enough flexibility for  co-options. That is what we need more than anything at the moment. At times,  those of us who are in councils where we are not the majority party take the  word of other people before hearing about a by-election somewhere else. That  makes one wonder. I think people know what I am saying. It is not entirely  straightforward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that every political party will apply itself  positively to the Bill. I congratulate Dawn on bringing it forward. It is a  piece of history. Let us hope that many more private Member&rsquo;s Bills will come  through this tortuous system successfully. This is another tier of the cake of  democracy that we have all striven to work for and achieve.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle, Ar dt&uacute;s, ba mhaith liom mo  bhu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il le Dawn Purvis as an Bhille seo a chur os &aacute;r gcomhair  inniu. Beidh Sinn F&eacute;in ag tabhairt taca&iacute;ochta don Bhille seo.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank Dawn Purvis for proposing her private Member&rsquo;s Bill  today. As other Members have said, it is a good piece of work by an individual  MLA. It has brought an issue of great public debate to the Floor. As previously  outlined by my party colleagues Cathal Boylan and Daith&iacute; McKay, Sinn F&eacute;in is  broadly supportive of the Bill. We agree with the principle that there should  be no dual mandates and that people should not be councillors and Members of  the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As a member of the Assembly and Executive Review Committee,  the issue of dual and multiple mandates is part of the Committee&rsquo;s forward work  programme. I ask the proposer to be conscious of that Committee and to work  closely with it and with the Environment Committee.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As has been said, the matter formed a large part of the  discussion in the review of public administration. Therefore, we need to work  with everyone involved to avoid any duplication or waste of public resources.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Arguments have been put forward about why there should not  be an end to dual mandates now or in the future. We heard that councils are the  first rung on the ladder, where the young and the inexperienced can cut their  teeth. However, as Daith&iacute; McKay pointed out, an individual cannot be both a  councillor and a TD in the Twenty-six Counties. All the same arguments were  trotted out when that decision was made, and we have to avoid using them as a  cover.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It may have been acceptable for people in the North to not  want to give up their council jobs because of the fragility of the  institutions. However, we need to have confidence in this institution and,  indeed, in our party colleagues. It is not fair, right or proper for people to  argue that they have to let go in order to give other people an opportunity.  There are people within our party who are able and willing to do the job of a  councillor and who do not see that role as part of a graduation towards being  an Assembly Member or whatever. They see it as part of the political work and  programme in which we are involved. It may have been unintentional, but Members  were almost patronising when they seemed to suggest that they could not let go  of their jobs as councillors because the people coming behind them may not be  good enough or experienced enough. We have to avoid that type of language,  because it only adds to the sense that people want to hold on to their council  jobs for the sake of holding on.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members talked about lack of attendance, but that is a  matter that parties have to be on top of. I listened to Stephen Farry talk  about his previous role as Mayor of North Down Borough Council, Naomi Long&rsquo;s  role as the Lord Mayor of Belfast  and the good jobs that they have done. No one doubts that, and, indeed, my party  colleagues have held similar roles. However, when people seek a mandate, they  must be able to confidently say that the political representation will continue  to be of the highest standards possible and that representative roles do not  necessarily have to be carried out by the same people in each of the different  institutions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It will be better for all Members, all parties and everyone  whom we represent when we have the confidence to say that our candidate is the  best person to do the job. Danny Kinahan spoke about putting up big names for  election. Any party that has to rely on the tactic of putting up a candidate  who has to stand down three weeks later displays a lack of confidence. Indeed,  the electorate will see through such a tactic and vote accordingly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill, in principle, captures what is right; it is not  just a matter of capturing the popular mood. Members spoke about  double-jobbing, expenses and other issues. Ending dual mandates is the right  thing to do. Some representatives say that they work 18 hours a day when they  are in the Assembly and then try to convince people that they have the other  six hours to work as a councillor. We must provide the best representation  possible, and that means representatives having single jobs.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Purvis</strong>: I  thank all Members who contributed to the debate, from all sides of the House,  for their consideration of the Bill, their supportive comments and the concerns  that they expressed about the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I approached the Bill on the premise of every party in the  House having committed itself to ending dual mandates. When I listened to Peter  Weir, I wondered whether his party is still committed to the end of dual  mandates. However, Mr Weir did raise issues about the practical implications of  the Bill, particularly a situation in which someone might wish to stand in two  elections that are held on the same day and find themselves disqualified from  one of those. Indeed, I mentioned that possibility in my opening comments and I  share concerns about that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I said that, originally, I had considered a period of grace  being a part of that, but it would have complicated the Bill. However, that can  be considered at Committee Stage. I look forward to working with the Committee  in trying to improve the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Weir spoke about standards of democracy, and I spoke  about public confidence and perceptions. He said &mdash; I paraphrase his words &mdash;  that we should not allow public perception to dictate our policy. However,  public perception is at the core of the health of our democracy. If the public  have a negative perception of what Members try to do, it impacts on the level  of public confidence in political institutions, including the Assembly and  local government. Public perception is absolutely real. There is a problem with  dual mandates, and if the majority of voters perceive that to be so, there is a  problem.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Weir spoke about co-option being an opportunity and the  complementarity between the roles of councillor and MLA. He saw that as an  advantage, which might be so. However, the public see no advantage in someone  holding two elected positions at the same time. He misses the point of the dual  mandate issue, which is about political power being held in a limited number of  hands.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Farry also missed the point when he spoke about a  conflict of time, whereby one part-time job is not a job at all whereas the  other job is full-time. The issue is that the public perceive two elected  positions being held by the same person as being a concentration of power in  that person.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Cathal Boylan rightly said that the issue is still about  two jobs. He said that the public perception is important because it is  extremely negative, and it affects the level of confidence in our institutions.  He made a strong case based on conflict of interest.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Lord Morrow rightly spoke about the role that councillors  played in the past. He recognised, as did other Members, the importance of that  role and councillors&rsquo; contributions to democracy in Northern Ireland. However, do we  not want the opposite for our future? We are concerned about the here and now,  and the building of public confidence in our political institutions so that we  can bring in new blood and new people who are under-represented. That is what  we are trying to work towards. It is not about harking back to the past but trying  to create a better future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Roy Beggs commended the brevity of the Bill and said that Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  credibility has suffered because of dual and triple mandates. He pointed to the  devolved institutions of Scotland  and Wales,  which brought in mechanisms to end dual mandates. He said that there are few  elected representatives in Scotland  and Wales  who hold dual mandates. He asked how Members who hold down two jobs and spread  themselves thinly can be effective. He outlined the personal cost for those who  choose to do so. He also talked about the new super-councils and the increased  responsibility for local councillors and how it would become more difficult to  do two jobs. He said that it is better for elected representatives to be more  rounded, and although we cannot legislate to end dual mandates between the  Assembly and Westminster,  it is right to concentrate on ending the dual mandates for which we can  legislate.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Roy Beggs rightly pointed out Arlene Foster&rsquo;s statement in  March 2008 about ending dual mandates. The commitment was given, but no action  taken. This private Member&rsquo;s Bill came about because there was no action from  the Minister responsible. The commitment was given in March 2008, and by  December 2008 I decided to look at legislating against dual mandates, because  there was no action.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although some may argue that the Bill is populist, it has  been in process &mdash; Daith&iacute; McKay spoke about the process of bringing forward a  private Member&rsquo;s Bill &mdash; since December 2008. That shows how long and drawn-out  a process it is to get a Bill to this stage. It is not a populist measure, as  Stephen Farry said: wanting inclusive, transparent, participative democracy is  not populist. The Bill is about the principles and values that we want to  uphold in our democratic system.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I suppose it should come as no surprise that the Alliance Party is not currently  for inclusive democracy, given that it signed up to the transfer of policing  and justice powers on the basis of &lsquo;A Shared Future&rsquo; document, which no one has  seen.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: On  a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker, is this a discussion on local government  or a discussion on policing and justice?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: That is not a point of order, Dr Farry.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Purvis</strong>: I  thank Mrs Kelly for her intervention; she sums the matter up well. SDLP  Members, as Mrs Kelly said, are broadly supportive of the Bill, although they  raised concerns with which I have a great deal of sympathy. I look forward to  working with the Committee on those concerns.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mrs Kelly spoke about the greater representation of women  and minorities, including young people, by opening up our politics and making  it more representative. She appreciated, as did others, the service of local  councillors but believed that co-option and the co-option mechanism, which we  will, hopefully, have by the end of the month, will do away with expensive  by-elections and help the passage of the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mrs Kelly said that public perception in this place was a  huge piece of work and she understood the levels to which we have to go to  build public confidence. She raised an important point about the Committee  looking at those who sit in the House of Lords, for example; that may be  something for the Committee to examine with regard to ending dual mandates  between local government and the Lords, MEPs and those at Westminster. I look forward to working with  Mrs Kelly and others through the Committee.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Farry said that he thought that there may not be a need  to legislate in advance of the next election, although I was unclear about his  argument why. He talked about his party&rsquo;s achievements in its representative  nature in selecting people for election and the number of people whom they have  elected. However, I notice an absence of those from a disadvantaged social and  economic background.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  For the Member&rsquo;s information, my father worked in a factory and was unemployed  for many years, and Naomi Long comes from a single-parent family in Mersey Street.  Therefore I wonder whether the Member wishes to retract that comment about the  breadth of the advantage or disadvantage among Alliance representatives.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Purvis</strong>: I  thank the Member for his intervention, but I have absolutely no intention of  retracting that comment. I probably enforce the perception that others have  about the Alliance Party being a middle-class party.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Stephen Farry said that there was a flaw in the Bill in  that if a vacancy arose it would fall back to the party initially to fill. I do  not see why that is a flaw when it is up to the party to select the candidates  in the first place, and if the party was committed to achieving a diverse group  of candidates for election, surely it would be committed to filling a place  with like?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That is a matter for parties, not for this Bill. He talked  about conflicts of interest, and rightly agreed that an MLA who is also a  Minister and a councillor has a conflict of interest because they could be  involved in decisions that concern local councils. However, he said that the  roles of MLA and councillor could be in harmony.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member also talked about a conflict of time, which I  have addressed already. He said that he does not see being a councillor in  local govern&shy;ment as a job, but I have difficulty with that. If a person  receives benefits through their elected office, they receive benefits in kind.  Therefore, it is seen as a job. Mr Farry misses the point of this Bill. If his  party is committed to ending dual mandates, it should support the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Daith&iacute; McKay talked about the importance of ending dual  mandates as it would bring forward under-represented groups. He talked about  legislation in the Republic   of Ireland that allows  councillors to become TDs to vacant council seats and allow co-option. He said  that this is a short but important piece of legislation that will herald a new  beginning for local government with new responsibilities, which is what we are  trying to achieve by ending dual mandates. It is an opportunity for change.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Danny Kinahan stated his intention to stand down from  council as soon as the co-option becomes law. He does not believe that he would  be able to do both jobs. I appreciate his honesty. He said that we need new  blood, and he paid tribute to councillors and their work. Like many others, he  would like to see more women and ethnic groups involved in politics. He said  that that would show that Northern    Ireland is not as divided as it is  perceived. Like others, he was concerned that a big name could be used to stand  and then stand down to let in a new and unknown person. That is the potential  in this Bill. Mr Kinahan also talked about the need for change in our electoral  system. He said that MLAs&rsquo; offices should be opened up to partnership working  with councils. He talked about the need to encourage more people, particularly  young people, into politics, and he criticised the fact that those who work for  government are not allowed to stand for election. He said that that needs to be  reviewed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Raymond McCartney said that Sinn F&eacute;in was broadly  supportive of the Bill. The issue of dual mandates is part of the Assembly and  Executive Review Committee&rsquo;s forward work programme, and he highlighted the  need for me and others to work closely together, particularly with the  Environment Committee, to ensure that there is no overlap. He said that that  would get the best out of this Bill as regards any amendments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McCartney also raised the same issue as Daith&iacute; McKay:  that a person in the Republic   of Ireland cannot be a  councillor as well as a TD. In addition, he raised the issue of employment  insurance, which I brought up at the very start. There is a need to have  confidence in this institution. Holding on to another mandate does not  demonstrate a sense of confidence; it demonstrates a lack of confidence in  moving forward. He said that when people seek a mandate, they have confidence  that they will carry out their duties to the best of their ability. In  addition, he said that the Bill catches what is right, and that it is the right  thing to do.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I really appreciate the points that were made by everyone  today. This Bill shows what is good about our institutions and our Assembly. It  shows that politics can work. There is an opportunity to show our voters and  the public that we are serious about ending the practice of dual mandates,  within a specific time frame towards which every party is committed to working.  All parties are on record as favouring the end of dual mandates. My question  is: why the delay? I look forward to working with the Committee, and I thank  Members for their consideration.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That the Second Stage of the Local Government  (Disqualification) (Amendment) Bill <span class="Italic">[NIA 7/09]</span> be agreed.</p>
    <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="10"></a>Private Members&rsquo; Business</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Farm Modernisation Programme</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee previously agreed that when two or more  amendments have been selected, additional time may be allocated at the  Speaker&rsquo;s discretion. As two amendments have been selected, up to one hour and  45 minutes will be allowed for the debate. The proposer will have 10 minutes to  propose the motion and 10 minutes in which to make a winding-up speech. The  proposer of each amendment will have 10 minutes to propose and five minutes in  which to make a winding-up speech. All other Members who are called to speak  will have five minutes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That this Assembly calls on the Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development to bring forward fair and practical criteria  for implementation of tranche 2 of the farm modernisation programme.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the day moves on, people may lose interest in some of  the matters that we debate, but this is a very important issue for a wide range  of our people, particularly in the agriculture and farming community. I declare  an interest as a farmer and a member of the Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union (UFU). My  declaration comes from a slightly different angle: sometimes, one declares an  advantageous interest, but, in common with those surrounding it, my farm is in  a severely disadvantaged area. I am not sure whether Members want to refer to  me as a severely disadvantaged farmer, but that is the classification of the  area from which I come.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We must first look at tranche 1 of the farm modernisation  scheme, which is part of the rural development programme. When we saw queues  lasting for at least one full night for applications for tranche 1, most people  realised that the delivery mechanism was pretty much an abysmal failure. That  is not to say that the Minister and the Department were not warned. Months  previously, I had warned that the application process for the farm  modernisation scheme would be like the January sales queues. That spectacle  disappointed farmers, because our community got a lot of very bad press at the  time, with some media commentators likening the application process to soup  kitchen queues. Others questioned how desperate farmers must be to queue up all  night for a few thousand pounds. That is how the event was portrayed in the  media.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The mechanism that was used resulted in a large section of  the farming community not getting any support or help at all. I am sure that  the Minister will put me right when she speaks, but, from memory, I think that  of the more than 9,000 applications for tranche 1 of the farm modernisation  scheme, something over 1,200 &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. If Members wish to carry on private conversations they  should do so outside the Chamber. It is difficult enough to hear what the  Member is saying.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker. I was saying that of the more than  9,000 applications for tranche 1, I think that only around 1,200 applicants got  letters of offer. That was a huge disappointment for the nearly 8,000 farmers  who submitted unsuccessful applications. Those farmers feel that a better  system must be put in place.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I was accused here last week by the Minister&rsquo;s party  colleague Mr McElduff of never saying anything positive in the Chamber.  However, on this matter, I felt much more positive that the Department was  bringing forward criteria-based proposals as part of a fairly simplified  process that was not laden with bureaucracy, as so often happens with such  applications.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I felt that that was helpful and positive. However, when we  saw the criteria, we felt somewhat differently. Out of a total of 95 marks, one  criterion &mdash; farming in a severely disadvantaged area &mdash;produced 36 marks, which  equates to more than 36% of the marks that one could possibly get for being in  a single land classification. We did not believe that that was fair or  practical. When we raised the matter with the Minister, at first, she proposed  awarding nil marks for lowland farmers. Eventually, she raised that to 10  marks.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am not saying that land classification should not be a  criterion at all. Some people think that it should not, but I believe that land  classification should be included in the mechanism, although in a much smaller  range. For example, submitting one&rsquo;s application by e-mail is a criterion for  which one is awarded five marks; whereas, delivering it by hand or posting it  do not qualify for any marks. That is a difference of only five marks. If the  difference between severely disadvantaged areas and lowland areas ranged from  five to 10 marks, most farmers could live with it. We want further engagement  and consultation about such outcomes. When an organisation such as the Ulster  Farmers&rsquo; Union, which represents a wide and varied range of farmers from  throughout the community, including hill farmers, who, incidentally, come  mainly from severely disadvantaged areas, supports the farmers&rsquo; view that the  proposals are not fair or right, the Minister must appreciate the community&rsquo;s  enormous opposition to them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">An equality impact assessment should be carried out on the  proposals. The Department carried out an equality impact assessment on the  rural development programme. The farm modernisation programme will severely  affect one section of the farming community &mdash; lowland farmers &mdash; and we can  assess from which community the majority of those farmers come. I have heard it  suggested that it amounts to sectarian discrimination. Therefore, an equality  impact assessment must be carried out on the proposed scheme.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am also disappointed that the Minister has yet to tell  the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development whether the scheme is past  the post. Will there be no turning back? We need to know &mdash; I hope that the  Minister will address the point &mdash; whether there is still room for discussion  and consultation. In order to establish a fairer way forward, we want  discussions to involve the Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union,  the Northern Ireland Agricultural Producers Association (NIAPA), the Committee  for Agriculture and Rural Development and, indeed, all other interested groups.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The age of the farmer is another criterion that has been  used. To be fair, I support that, because young farmers need such assistance. They  are the farmers of the future. Compared to other businesses, the average age of  farmers in Northern Ireland  is very high. Therefore, we must do all that we can to encourage the young  farmer. E-communication and submitting applications by e-mail is a positive  move. Hopefully, that will cut bureaucracy and paperwork for the farming  community.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The degree of modernisation is another criterion that gives  me concern. How will that be calculated? Is a yard sweeper a less modern piece  of equipment than a cow cubicle, or is a tractor sprayer more modern than a  grass topper? It will be interesting to see how all that is worked out. I do  not believe that there should be a 20-point difference between top- and  low-level equipment. That gap is much too wide. If the money is for  modernisation, it should be for modernisation: full stop. I do not know where  the top level and low level come in.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I wonder whether the Minister has clearly thought through  the matter with the union, the Committee and NIAPA, in order to explore all the  other avenues fully, because I am aware that other proposals were put forward  that the Department has not accepted. For example, one suggestion was that  people engaged in full-time farming would be one criterion, and that, perhaps,  there could be a bracket for full-time and part-time farmers. Many farmers come  from lowland areas, and a lot of them rely on farming and agriculture for their  sole income; those people need help.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has indicated that one of the reasons for  using the severely disadvantaged area land classification is that she wants to  target disadvantaged areas, but surely the less-favoured area compensatory  allowance does that, because there is a payment for severely disadvantaged and  disadvantaged areas. However, there is no payment for lowland areas. In fact,  severely disadvantaged areas get more than &pound;40 per hectare and disadvantaged  areas get in the region of &pound;20 per hectare. I ask the Minister and the  Department to review the decision urgently.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  I beg to move amendment No 1: leave out all after &lsquo;Development&rsquo; and insert</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&lsquo;to re-engage immediately in discussions with the  Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union and the Northern Ireland Agricultural Producers&rsquo;  Association with a view to bringing forward fair and practical criteria for  implementation of tranche 2 of the farm modernisation programme.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have no difficulty with the motion and with amendment No  2. It is a pity that we did not get together and draft one motion, because I  can live with the motion and both amendments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The last two decades have seen a marked decline in farming  activities across the North, and nowhere is it more in evidence than on farms  located in severely disadvantaged areas and less-favoured areas. On a drive  through the countryside, it is clear to see that everything is not as it should  be. Farm buildings and farm land are in a dilapidated state as a result of  inactivity. The decline began when many farmers of small farms could no longer  make a living from their holdings. Therefore, to supplement their income, they  took up employment mainly in the construction industry, in quarries and in  construction related businesses. As we all know, such opportunities are no  longer available; but, if such farmers were sufficiently encouraged, I know  that many of them would only be too willing to reactivate their small farms.  They are located mostly in less-favoured areas. They are not looking to  purchase combine harvesters, John Deere 8RT series tractors, or  top-of-the-range machinery; but, given a sufficient level of encouragement and  financial support, they could become active again.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I have said, the lack of farming activity on many small  farms has resulted in the deterioration of sheds, farmyards and out-offices. It  should be the aim of DARD and all interested parties to make some preparation  that would encourage part-time farmers and farmers of small farms to become  active in farming activities. That appears to be what the Minister is planning  to do, and I have no difficulty with it. Indeed, I welcome such an incentive.  However, there is one thing that we must not do in the process, and that is to  ignore the full-time, more productive, farmers who form the backbone of the  agriculture industry that we are all so proud of and that so many people depend  on. I look back to the nights of 15 February and 16 February 2009 when farmers  queued for up to 60 hours outside DARD offices hoping to get a slice of the  farm modernisation programme. Many of them were unsuccessful. The vast majority  simply had to accept what happened then and be prepared to wait for the  announcement of tranche 2.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Had the Minister made some effort this time to assist those  disappointed farmers, we might not be having this debate today. However, by her  proposal for tranche 2, the Minister is walking along the line to single people  out in a &ldquo;you&rdquo;, &ldquo;not you&rdquo; manner, which is a totally unacceptable manner of  selection.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In February 2009, and as the old saying goes, many were  called but few were chosen. It should not happen like that again. I accept that  getting the balance right might be difficult to achieve, but some form of  pro-rata arrangement must be agreed. I am aware that the Minister met with the Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union  and the Northern Ireland Agricultural Producers&rsquo; Association and that no  agreement was reached.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I believe that the SDLP amendment is the road to follow, as  it will introduce further professional debate to the issue. I say  &ldquo;professional&rdquo;, as both unions referred to in the amendment have played active  roles on behalf of their members, and they deserve praise from everyone for  their dedication to the farming industry.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not wish to be told by anyone today that we have no  money. Recently, I sent the Minister a question for written answer in which I  questioned her on the amount of money that has been deducted from the single  farm payment cheques. She informed me that the sums collected in the past three  years were: &euro;28&middot;7 million in 2007; &euro;34&middot;25 million in 2008; and &euro;38&middot;7 million in  2009. In 2004-05, when the Minister was determined to increase the sums being  deducted from the single farm payment, we were told that a large percentage of  the funding would be returned to the farming community via improvement schemes.  Given that &euro;101&middot;6 million has been collected as a result of the modulation  process in the past three years, surely sufficient funding should be available  to allow the Minister not only to deliver on the proposals for the  less-favoured areas but to make an accommodation for lowland farmers who have  been denied equality.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Other questions could be raised about the &euro;101&middot;6 million  and about how it has been allocated. For example, how much of it has gone to  full-time farmers? How much has gone on non-farming projects? How much has gone  towards administration? However, those questions provide material for another  debate on another day.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have a number of questions for the Minister on her  proposals. Will she confirm that her proposals were equality proofed? Mr  Elliott touched on that. Is the Minister certain that her proposals are beyond  legal challenge? If she is, will she provide the Chairperson or the Committee  Clerk of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development with a copy of the  advice that she was given?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I note that points are to be given under the heading  &ldquo;Succession opportunity&rdquo;. I have some difficulty with that element of the  proposal. Perhaps the Minister will explain her thinking behind the succession  benefits. I agree that all of us must support young farmers. In fact, most  people would describe a farmer who is in his or her 40s as a relatively young  or even middle-aged person, who, perhaps, has children of primary school age. I  could accept the age of 60 being given in this instance, but I fail to  understand why those who have crossed their fortieth birthday are to be denied  points solely because they are considered too old.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I recognise that the Minister does not always carry out the  wishes of the House or, for that matter, those of the Committee. Therefore, it  is important that she meets immediately with the Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union and NIAPA in an effort to reach an agreement that  will be acceptable to the farming community in general. The Minister must  listen closely to the voices of the industry.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Members, lest there be any confusion, and for your clarification,  regardless of whether amendment No 1 is made, amendment No 2 can still be made.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Irwin</strong>: I  beg to move amendment No 2: At end insert</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;; and to ensure that, following the underspend in the  manure efficiency technology subprogramme (METS) in tranche 1, more farmers are  given an opportunity to access the METS element in tranche 2.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In moving amendment No 2, I should say that we support the  motion, and I am assured that the proposers of the motion support our  amendment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. I  declare an interest as a farmer. The farm modernisation programme has been a  welcome benefit to those farmers in Northern Ireland who were  successful in the first round of funding. At its core, the programme has the  capacity to help farming here to improve its competitiveness and to meet new  challenges in the sector. However, we have heard and are aware of a number of  important issues that have come to light following the administration of the  first tranche. We have grave concerns over the proposals that the Minister has  issued on criteria for the second tranche.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have received many calls from concerned farmers stating  that they are unhappy with the Minister&rsquo;s proposals at this time. The Minister  stated her desire to target less-favoured areas in the second tranche. Although  I have no problem with the scheme being open to farmers in less-favoured areas,  it is wrong to focus the majority of the scoring on land classification.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">For a Minister who regularly triumphs the word &ldquo;equality&rdquo;,  this is an inequality for lowland farmers. Making the second tranche open, fair  and based on equal opportunity must be addressed. The current proposed criteria  effectively close the door to lowland farmers by weighing the scoring heavily  towards severely disadvantaged areas, and the negative message that that will  send out to lowland farmers will be damaging to the industry. That has to be  addressed through the Department&rsquo;s use of criteria, based on equality.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">6.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As regards my party&rsquo;s amendment, which concerns the manure  efficiency technology subprogramme, many lessons are there to be learned on how  the Department could greatly improve administrative procedures in order to  better spend available cash and, of course, assist more farmers. Figures that I  obtained in a written answer from the Minister show that &pound;1&middot;68 million was  allocated to that subprogramme. A commendable 853 applications were received.  Of those 853 applications, 176 were considered successful. However, just 117 of  those applicants accessed the available funding, which left a clear underspend.  The Minister confirmed to me that 59 applicants would not be proceeding with  their investment, for a variety of reasons.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We all realise that plans can change rapidly in the  agriculture business, especially in the current economic climate, in which  banks are ever more cautious. I understand fully why some farmers did not go  through with their METS projects. The important fact is that a significant  amount of METS funding has not been spent. Ultimately, the Department should  have had a system in place that went to the next applicant and invited him or  her to draw down that funding. Of course, that did not happen. Unfortunately,  other applicants had their applications sent back, rather than held in a queue,  which meant that, in order to spend the unspent cash, the Department would have  to reinvite applications, which would incur yet more administration costs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In her written response, the Minister suggested to me that  farmers are reluctant to make substantial investments in that type of equipment  in the current economic climate. I argue that the Minister&rsquo;s conclusion is not  reflective of the situation, given the vast number of applications that were  received &mdash; 853, to be precise.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is also concern that removing the METS element will  mean that the hundreds of unsuccessful farmers who have waited patiently to  avail themselves of the second tranche will be unable to do so and will,  undoubtedly, feel short-changed by the Department. The level of interest that  has been shown in the subprogramme has been proven by the number of  applications to the first tranche. I ask the Minister to reopen the METS  element in tranche 2 and, through better administration practices, to ensure  that the allocation is fully spent.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister and her Department must go back to the drawing  board and address deep concerns about the proposed criteria and inequalities in  the second tranche. She must also ensure that the many farmers who have been  waiting for the reopening of the METS programme in the next tranche are given  the opportunity to avail themselves of that important funding element.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Doherty</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. The Minister has brought forward  fair and practical criteria for the implementation of tranche 2 of the farm  modernisation scheme. I contend that it is the duty of the Department and the  Minister to target disadvantage and to deal with inequality in her sector of  responsibility. That does not mean that the Department should hand out the same  sum of money to every applicant; it means that there is a responsibility to  create a level playing field for everybody concerned. The Minister and her  Department have attempted to do that in the delivery of tranche 2 of the farm  modernisation scheme.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  Does the Member agree that giving 35 points, which is well over a third of the  total number of points, to someone who farms in a severely disadvantaged area  is a fair and equal way to do that?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Doherty</strong>:  I thought that I covered that when a made my point about a level playing field.  Perhaps, in time, the Member will understand what that means.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also note that NIAPA and the National Beef Association  support the scheme. The Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union  has some concerns. However, in the second last paragraph of its letter to  Minister Gildernew, dated 5 February 2009, which was copied to the Committee  for Agriculture and Rural Development, it states:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Despite our concerns around the delivery of tranche 2  of the Farm Modernisation Scheme the UFU recognises that there are some very  positive aspects of the scheme; most notably that it represents a significant  amount of support to help farmers modernise their businesses, and promotes  substantial expenditure in the rural economy. The simple application form used  in tranche 1 should also be commended.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Although the UFU was concerned, at least it saw some  solid value in the proposals. The Committee met members of the Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union on 9 February and asked questions on their  submission. They talked about awarding at least five marks for lowland farmers.  In the event, the Minister listened, took their advice and went on to award 10  marks. Therefore, there has been consultation and a degree of listening.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I draw the attention of the House to a letter that everyone  in the Committee agreed to send to the Department on 2 July 2009, which  highlighted the following possibilities for inclusion in tranche 2. I will not  read out the content of the letter, but I will highlight the six key points.  The first is aid to encourage young farmers to enter or remain in the industry;  that has been covered. The second is support to poultry farmers; that has also  been covered. The third is grants to fruit growers; again, that has been  covered. The fourth is targeting small farmers; that has most certainly been  covered. The fifth is modernisation of energy provision, and the sixth is  modernisation of facilities for pig farmers.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Irwin</strong>:  Fruit farmers are, in the main, in the Loughgall/Armagh area. I am not aware of  any in the less-favoured areas.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Doherty</strong>:  That is fair enough, and I believe that the Minister has responded to that.  However, when the Committee wrote to the Minister and the Department in July  2009, they took account of all that it said. As they have gone through that  process, it is unfair to try to accuse the Minister and the Department of not  creating a level playing field. I support the motion, even though the Members  opposite have yet to consider why.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: At  the outset, I declare my wife&rsquo;s shared interest in a family farm, which is in  an original LFA or SDA, and, therefore, probably much of what I will say will  be seen as arguing against her personal interests.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I congratulate Tom Elliott and his colleagues on tabling  the motion. My initial response was something the same as that given by P J  Bradley when he proposed his amendment and said that he supported the original  motion as amended by him to refer to consultation issues and with the addition  of the DUP amendment. Having just heard Mr Doherty&rsquo;s response to that, I advise  the proposer of the motion to accept the SDLP&rsquo;s amendment or he will be seen as  not having stated what needs to be stated: that there has been insufficient  consultation and that there needs to be much greater consultation, particularly  with the Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union and NIAPA, to ensure that the matter is dealt  with properly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If we look at the criteria in the most recent revision of  the scheme &mdash; this scheme has been through a number of different revisions &mdash; it  is clear that no one could object to the notion of a small number of marks  being awarded for encouraging e-communications. That is part of modernisation.  However, broadband communication is less easy in more remote rural areas than  it is in other areas. By the same token, the concept of handling succession  issues by awarding a modest number of marks seems entirely reasonable. However,  whether a 40-year-old is young, middle-aged or old is a matter that will  generate some discussion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Once we hit the modernisation marks, an issue arises that  will create difficulties. As someone said, what is modern on one farm may still  be something that is to be aimed for on another. There are real issues as to  whether modernisation can be seen in such a simplistic, cut-off way, in which  points are awarded for certain items but not for others. I am not entirely  surprised that that seems to be one of the reasons why the UFU was unhappy to  engage with the Department in dealing with the issue. I am not sure how one can  categorise what is more modernising and what is less modernising on a  simplistic basis across the whole region, when, clearly, some farms are already  more modern and advanced than others.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The major issue that has caused so much concern is the  issue that I referred to at the beginning: the fact that land classification  carries such a substantial number of marks. That effectively means that, even  if someone is getting marks for e-communications, youthfulness and the most  modernising equipment, if they do not fall within a disadvantaged area &mdash;  potentially even a severely disadvantaged area &mdash; they will have major  difficulties in getting any money at all under the scheme. That is the point  where the scheme is fundamentally unfair and is failing to meet the aim of  modernising farming across every part of Northern Ireland, not just in one  particular area. I believe it is wrong, simply because every farmer has had  money taken from him or her through so-called voluntary modulation, which may  be voluntary according to the determination of government but is certainly not  voluntary according to the determination of the farm.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are real issues about the way in which the scheme  appears to be attempting to balance out other schemes in a way that is  fundamentally unfair. There are other schemes that are more likely to benefit  people in less-favoured areas but do not completely rule out applications from  lowland farmers. It seems that it is easier to get countryside management  grants or some of the forestry grants in less-favoured areas than it is in the  lowland. Yet, those schemes do not rule out applications from lowland farmers;  they are simply schemes that deliver in such a way. To attempt to compensate  for those schemes by twisting this scheme seems to be fundamentally wrong,  because the way to compensate for those schemes is to ensure that grants are  given fairly in every scheme, regardless of how to apply.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It seems that the Minister has questions to answer as to  why there was so little consultation. If there was no proper consultation with  the stakeholders, that would seem to be fundamentally at variance with what we  would expect. In particular, when we consider all that went wrong with the  first tranche of the scheme, those ludicrous pictures of people queuing  endlessly in order to apply for the scheme have surely highlighted the absolute  need to get tranche 2 right &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member must draw his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: &mdash;  and not to go through a further and difficult decision on the way in which this  tranche operates.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr W McCrea</strong>:  I wish to express my grave concern at the decision of the Minister of Agriculture  and Rural Development to deliver tranche 2 of the farm modernisation scheme in  the manner that she has proposed. I accept that the manner in which the first  tranche was delivered was not acceptable to Europe  and that, therefore, relevant and necessary changes had to be made. We all  acknowledge that. However, the steps taken by the Minister to change the scheme  are, in my opinion, unacceptable to many in the agriculture industry and are  looked upon by many as discriminatory.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am not saying that there is nothing in the scheme that is  worthy to be kept; many things are, but changes need to be made. Should the  Minister be permitted to proceed with her present proposals, they would be  detrimental to a large number of farmers from whom the money was taken in the  first place. The lowland farmers would be disadvantaged significantly and  denied a fair and equitable opportunity to access limited funding for farm  modernisation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One of the major faults with the proposed scheme is the  manner in which the Minister decided and announced it without proper and  meaningful consultation with stakeholders, the unions or even the Committee for  Agriculture and Rural Development. To present a scheme that is a fait accompli  is scandalous, and one must ask why there was so much secrecy. The Committee  has asked for certain papers; we will wait to see whether those and all the  relevant documents have actually been presented to the Committee.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Let me make it clear: I do not wish to discriminate against  any sector of the farming industry, whether it is in less favoured, severely  disadvantaged or lowland areas. All I wish to do is ensure that all farmers  have an equal opportunity to modernise their farm and be eligible to do so.  What is wrong with such a position? The Minister&rsquo;s scheme, as it stands, will  deliberately disadvantage many people simply because they happen not to be in a  particular area. To virtually exclude such people from a modernisation  programme would surely be detrimental to the future of the industry and would  be an act of open discrimination.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">6.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I had hoped that a way forward could have been found that  would satisfy the vast majority of farmers in the Province. Unfortunately,  however, that has not been possible because of the Minister&rsquo;s intransigence.  The Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union has proposed a  greater number of criteria than have been selected by the Department, and the  outworking of that would provide a more acceptable spread. The real sting in  the tail from the Minister has been the fact that one single criterion, land  classification, has been allocated such a high percentage of overall marks.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I understand the right of any individual to hold political  aspirations, but those cannot be carried into a scheme in the agriculture  industry. Farmers throughout Northern    Ireland have given so much to the Province  and to its prosperity in good times and in difficult times over the years that  I cannot allow party politics to influence the right of a Minister to  discriminate against farmers. The issue is sensitive, and it strikes at the  heart of equality. Reducing equity of opportunity is against the Programme for  Government and the other fundamentals that have been proclaimed and are  supposedly held sacred by the Assembly, although, it seems, only when it suits.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I therefore call on the Assembly to demand that the  Minister takes back the proposal and the present scheme and that she not only  assists a particular grouping in the farming industry but allows equity of  treatment and opportunity for all farmers. That is in the best interests of the  Province&rsquo;s greatest industry.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I support the modernisation  proposals that have been put forward under tranche 2 of the farm modernisation  programme. Members complained about the way that tranche 1 was administered at  the time, said that it was embarrassing and raised other issues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union  raised a number of points in its briefing paper that I wish to question. It  said that lower land is virtually excluded from assessment under the  modernisation programme. As my colleague Pat Doherty pointed out, the Ulster  Farmers&rsquo; Union proposed that five marks be  allocated for that group of farmers in a specific area. The Minister accepted  that and has, in fact, doubled that by allocating 10 marks.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have not heard complaints about those who were excluded  in the past. When the dairy sector and the beef sector received funding, we did  not hear about farmers in less-favoured areas who had not received funding. No  one spoke on their behalf to ensure that they received funding. The Ulster  Farmers&rsquo; Union has proposed six criteria that  it feels could be part of the programme. It appears that the Minister and the  Department have taken on board a number of those points, excluded some and  added others, and they have done so to create equality and a level playing  field.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Equality does not mean that everyone gets the same when  privilege and rank already exist. Equality means trying to create a level  playing field, not dealing with it by making double payments to others. One of  the proposals from the Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union  is that those who are getting single farm payments should get another payment.  Those people already get a single farm payment, and some of them get an amount  that is in excess of what they would have ever got from business. Double  payments are not a way of doing it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Young farmers are included in the scheme, as is the option  to apply online. Full-time farmers already get the payment, and some are  farming in less-favoured areas. Those people would not be excluded from that  position.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">DARD&rsquo;s census figures show that 58% of dairy farms, 77% of  beef and sheep farms, 76% of suckler cows and 80% of all sheep are in  less-favoured areas. Given those figures, it is clear why the farm  modernisation programme targets farms in those areas.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We must move on. It should no longer be said that the  people who applied for a grant the last time but failed should get a second  chance before those who were excluded in the past and who have yet to get a  chance to apply for the first time. I am sure that the debate about the farm  modernisation programme will continue, because different people have different  interpretations. Some people view the provision of a machine on a farm in a  less-favoured area as modernisation. Such people would also like those who are  well off to get even more money. That goes back to the point about 20% of  people owning 80% of the wealth; that is not equality. Therefore, when we talk  about equality, we need to deal with it. The advice from Europe  is that those who work in difficult areas of farming should be supported in any  new tranche of funding, and the scheme is in keeping with that recommendation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members said that the programme discriminates against  certain areas. Those Members cannot have it both ways. You cannot drive people  up hills and into bogs, as Cromwell did, and then say, when those people start  to make money, that they should not get funding. Those who were discriminated  against by the old Stormont regime, driven off good land and put into debt  cannot be excluded again from receiving money. We must be fair. We are long  past the stage when advisers from the Agriculture Department went round Orange  Halls advising the Protestant and unionist community of what they were entitled  to, while excluding the broad community from the funding to which they were  entitled. Those days are over, and change has happened. We are now moving to &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. Continue, Mr Molloy.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  We are now moving to real equality, where everyone is treated equally and where  everyone has the same opportunities.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member must draw his remarks to close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  Everyone will get the same opportunity to apply for funding. The programme  recognises those in less-favoured areas so that they can get funding to  modernise their farms.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I wish to make it clear and put it on the record that I am not aware of any  Agriculture Department officials going round Orange Halls to encourage people  to do that. That did not happen. What the Member said is more akin to  &lsquo;Jackanory&rsquo; than factual evidence.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I must have missed the memo that said that Camelot has  taken over the allocation of funding from the Department of Agriculture and  Rural Development. I was unaware that we are advocating a postcode lottery  system in the Northern Ireland Assembly. Make no mistake: that is exactly what  is being proposed, which is why we are concerned about it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have consulted the Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union  about the issue, and I declare an interest as a member of that union for some  25 years. I live on a modern farm within a farming community, and I have seen  at first hand the need for modernisation on all farms in the Province. There is  a strong farming tradition in Northern    Ireland. Given that farms have been handed  down through the generations and that it is currently difficult to turn a  profit on a farm, it is obvious that paying a mortgage and the food bills,  buying a new tractor when the old one finally quits and ensuring that the farm  meets health and safety standards while still paying for normal day-to-day  bills ensures that the improvement and modernisation of farms, while important,  is far down the list of what can be done with present funds.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are all aware of the reasons why issues arose with the  first tranche of the scheme and why the second tranche needed to be different.  However, it is clear that the Minister, for whatever reasons, has not grasped  the need for equitable and fair criteria.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The UFU haes allooed at Aa fairmers wha pit catter intae  the scheme maun bae fit tae access hit. Hit bes unnerpinned bae thair catter  niver min&rsquo; airt ir cless o&rsquo; fairmin. Thon bes a notion at A gree wi completely,  fundin&rsquo; maun bae thair fer ivrieboadie at hes need fer hit an&rsquo; no oan a poast code  lottery at bes what the Minister bes indicatin&rsquo; micht happen bae targetin&rsquo;  airts o&rsquo; specific need onie.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union  has said that all farmers who contribute financially must be able to access a  scheme that is underpinned by that money, irrespective of location or sector. I  totally agree with that. Funding must be made available to all who need it and  must not be based on a postcode lottery, which is what may happen if only areas  of specific need are targeted. All farms in the Province should be allowed to  apply for a grant no matter where they are located, and criteria should be  based on a fair points system that does not automatically exclude a farm simply  because it is located beside other thriving farms.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has not taken into consideration the views of  the farming community or elected representatives in that no meaningful  consultation has taken place. The Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union  consulted its internal policy committees, which are made up of 400 members from  all sectors and all areas, including the less-favoured areas, to discuss  possible options for the delivery of tranche 2, bearing in mind the need for new  selection criteria. A clear recommendation came from the broad church of the  Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union. At a meeting on 23  September, a final position was agreed on the six criteria that, it was felt,  would allow all farmers a fair opportunity to access funding but, at the same  time, would allow a selection process to be carried out. The top six criteria &mdash;  that sounds similar to something from &lsquo;Top of the Pops&rsquo;, which I remember from  long ago &mdash; are farmers who were successful in tranche 1; younger farmers; full-time  farmers; farmers with any simple management records; farmers with agricultural  qualifications; and farmers who submit online. The Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union is concerned that only four eligibility criteria  have been selected by DARD as a greater number of criteria would provide a more  equitable spread of opportunity. The Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union  has clearly indicated where the problems are.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The points system that the Department plans to implement  will mean that more than 36% of the overall marks will be allocated to the land  classification category. We request that that be changed. The farm  modernisation scheme is not the way to do that. Instead, it should be done  through the existing less-favoured area compensatory allowances. Some 13,000  LFA farmers avail themselves of that scheme, and that is the system that should  be used.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also express concern over the METS scheme, as was  mentioned by my colleague when he moved our amendment. The scheme is necessary  to deliver environmental objectives and, through tranche 2, should be open to  all who need access to it. The need for modernisation is not confined simply to  severely disadvantaged areas but applies to disadvantaged farms no matter what  their allocation. That is the point that we make in our amendment.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member draw his remarks to a close?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I ask Members to support the DUP amendment and, by so doing, support the Ulster farmer.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>: I  declare an interest. I support the motion in my name and the names of two of my  party colleagues. We are happy to accept the DUP amendment, as it raises a  relevant issue that needs to be explored. However, we have concerns about the  SDLP amendment, as it only suggests re-engagement:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;with a view to bringing forward fair and practical  criteria&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The reality is that criteria must be brought  forward urgently.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion concerns an issue around which there is  tremendous strength and depth of feeling, especially following the events  surrounding tranche 1. We trust that the Department has learnt many lessons in  that regard, and I remind the Minister of her duty to serve and support all  farmers across Northern    Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members should take note of the farm modernisation  programme&rsquo;s purpose. It is designed to provide financial support for existing  farm businesses to improve overall performance on their farms through  modernisation. That, in turn, may lead to farm expansion, which is to be  welcomed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On 12 January 2009, in a DARD press release, the Minister  outlined tranche 1 and stated that &pound;15&middot;25 million would be made available in  funding. The press release went on to say that that &pound;15&middot;25 million would  include administration costs. I ask the Minister to give a breakdown of how  that &pound;15&middot;25 million was spent, detailing how much went to farmers across Northern Ireland  and how much was spent on administration costs. My concern is that the funds  were from the modulation money, which was given up voluntarily and in good  faith by farmers from their single farm payment. The funds ought to be used to  benefit farms across Northern    Ireland and not spent on administration.  Modulation money should not be squandered, and it was not meant to be used in  that way.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am concerned that, under tranche 2 plans, more than 36%  of the overall marks have been allocated to land classification. That decision  may disadvantage other applicants, and that may leave tranche 2 open to legal  challenge and thus to further delay. That is an avenue that we do not want to  go down.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To ensure that an equitable spread of opportunity exists,  our party, along with the House, shares the objectives of the Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">All farmers who contribute via voluntary modulations should  be able to access the programme, which, after all, is underpinned by their  money.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">6.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It appears that DARD has failed to properly consult on this  issue. Indeed, I have been told that the approach taken by the Department  towards the Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union has been  nothing short of appalling. DARD must not only invite stakeholders to its  offices, but must allow them to have their say. The Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union has told me that between October 2009 and 20  January 2010, the Department refused to facilitate a meeting to discuss tranche  2 of the farm modernisation programme. If that is true, I am most concerned at  the Department treating farmers&rsquo; representatives with such contempt.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">(Mr Deputy Speaker <span class="Italic">[Mr Dallat]</span> in the Chair)</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">All sides of the House want to see the farm modernisation  programme delivering for farmers across Northern Ireland. To that end, I  call on the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development to introduce fair and  practical criteria for the implementation of tranche 2 of the programme. I ask  Members to give the matter the consideration that it deserves and to support  the motion and amendment No 2.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On a personal note, farmers want to work with and not  against the Minister &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>:  No; I am nearly finished.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We do not want to put obstacles in the Minister&rsquo;s way, but  I plead with her to allow the farmers to do what they do best, which is to  farm. If the Minister supports farmers, we will support her.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burns</strong>: I  support the amendment tabled by the SDLP. I am not a farmer nor do I belong to  any of the farming unions. However, I live in the countryside and I want to make  a brief contribution to the debate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am glad that the motion is before the House, because many  farmers seem to be very unhappy with the Minister&rsquo;s proposals. I will not get  into the fine detail of every criterion, how each is applied, and the different  sets of circumstances, but everyone agrees that there is a need for  modernisation on every farm, and that we must do everything that we can to make  the farming industry as competitive as possible. The recession has hit us all  hard, the farming industry always seems to be struggling even in the best of  times, and we must not make life even more difficult for farmers. However, that  is what the farmers are saying is happening, and they are saying it very  loudly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On a personal note, I agree with the position of the Ulster  Farmers&rsquo; Union. It has been very critical of  the Minister&rsquo;s handling of tranche 2 of the programme, and all of us with an  interest in the topic will be aware of the very public disagreements that have  been aired in the media. The farmers have argued strongly that the scoring  system that the Minister wants to introduce will rule out lowland farmers, and  we have heard many complaints about the manure technology system and how  farmers will not be able to apply for extra money to bring in the latest  technology. I understand the points that farmers have made. They are very  angry, they feel that there was a lack of proper consultation, they claim that  the ideas that they put forward were ignored, and they protest that hundreds of  farmers have made applications for grants and only a few have been successful.  They also feel that they have been personally snubbed by the Minister and her  Department.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Farmers have told me that the decisions that the Minister  has made on the farm modernisation programme have been poor and that if she  wants to support farmers in less-favoured areas, it could be done through an  enhancement of the EU&rsquo;s farmers in less-favoured areas payment scheme, rather  than through the farm modernisation programme. They also feel that if that  programme does not allow farmers in certain areas to get access to the latest  equipment, it will send out the wrong message about the benefits of embracing  and using new technology, which will put us dangerously out of step with EU  policies.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister, in common with all Members, wants to do her  best for all farmers, particularly those who experience genuine hardship and  disadvantage. However, we must avoid a repeat of the shambles of the first  tranche, when farmers with blankets queued overnight on deckchairs outside DARD  offices. Lessons must be learned from that. The Minister and her officials must  take time to listen to the farmers, take their concerns on board and take their  opinions seriously. The farmers are best placed to know what it will take for  the agriculture industry to become and remain more competitive. I support the  SDLP amendment.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">Mr W Clarke</span>: Go raibh maith  agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. The entire House shares the view that it has been  a difficult period for all sectors of the agriculture and horticulture  industries and for society as a whole. The programme will provide farm  businesses with fiscal support to invest in new technology to modernise their  holdings, and it will provide a stimulus to the local economy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We should bear in mind that 70% of farms are located in  disadvantaged or severely disadvantaged areas and that some schemes are better  suited to certain areas than to others. In many instances, farmers cannot avail  themselves of the grants under the farm modernisation programme. Many farmers  from less-favoured areas could not avail themselves of the METS scheme in the  first tranche. Their ground was simply not suitable for the utilisation of such  specialised equipment, either because it was in bad condition or was too steep,  and, therefore, it had to be farmed. For the record, financial support of up to  &pound;10,000 was made available for a limited list of advanced slurry-handling  equipment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In my South Down constituency, I continually hear from  farmers that not enough is being done to support small farm businesses. I tried  to illustrate that general point to the Department&rsquo;s officials in Committee.  The figures on farm make-up from the recent agriculture census show that 76% of  farms are very small, 13% are small, 5% are medium and 6% are large. Therefore,  89% of farms are small or very small. When Members take into account that 70%  of all farms are in less-favoured areas, they will see what the Department, the  Minister and, indeed, Sinn F&eacute;in are trying to do.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The promotion of equality of opportunity requires proactive  measures to ensure such equality among the groups that are identified in  section 75. The equality duty should not hold back action to tackle  disadvantage among certain sections of society. It is not enough simply to  treat everyone equally; the inequalities must be eradicated first. In tackling  disadvantage through neighbourhood renewal or fuel poverty through the warm  homes scheme, for example, disadvantage is targeted while many other groups in  society are excluded. The Minister and Sinn F&eacute;in are eager that the second  tranche targets disadvantage by focusing on farms that are situated in  less-favoured areas. In those areas, there is a great need for modernisation,  and farmers there face an even bigger challenge to eke out a living from the  land than those in the lowlands.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Tom Elliott said that full-time, as opposed to part-time,  farmers should be prioritised. However, farmers work part-time because they  cannot earn a living from their land. The current recession makes their  situation even worse because they cannot fall back on their second jobs.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  Does the Member accept that the inability of part-time farmers to earn a living  from their farms also applies to some full-time farmers?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  I accept that, but the current recession means that the need in the part-time  sector is greater. Many part-time farmers had a second job in construction or  manufacturing, but those jobs no longer exist, and they are in direr straits  now than they were a year ago.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Discrimination was mentioned earlier, and it is a very  topical issue. There is very little that farmers can do about where they live.  Many farms and farm families are where they are because, as was said, they were  driven into the mountains at the time of the Plantation. Many Protestants, too, were  driven from the lowlands into poor, mountainous wetlands. Those people were  mainly Presbyterians and dissenters who would not join the Church of Ireland.  I put that on record, because Jim Shannon had an argument with me about that  before. I recognise that many Protestants as well as Catholics were driven into  the mountains.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The agricultural census for 2009 gives some interesting  statistics, which can put to bed the argument about discrimination. In Ballymena,  66% of farms are in less-favoured areas; in Belfast,  that figure is 68%; in Carrickfergus, it is 96%; in Fermanagh, it is 99%; in  Larne, it is 98%; in Moyle, it is 93%; and in Newtownabbey,  it is 57%. That is a funny sort of discrimination, because a large majority of  those areas have unionist-dominated councils. Therefore, I find the  Department&rsquo;s criteria for the scheme to be a very strange way of discriminating  against Protestants. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  I still have visions of freezing farmers queuing outside DARD offices for the  launch of the first tranche of funding. From that day, the entire method that  was used to roll out the scheme has been rightly condemned by those who are in  the industry and those who speak for it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My major concern is that there is an obvious exclusion for  lowland farmers, which results in their having little prospect of being treated  with equality. All farmers are having a difficult time due to the recession,  and they should all be treated equitably. When the European money was made  available for farm modernisation, criteria should have been imposed to ensure  that there would be no disparity between farmers. The scheme was not  administered properly, and that has created bad feeling between neighbouring  farmers. That is understandable, when farmers perceive that they are being  discriminated against.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On 23February, the Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union  described one of the Minister&rsquo;s recent announcements about the scheme as &ldquo;a  very poor decision&rdquo;. Again, that was due to the negative effect that it would  have on lowland farmers. The decision to remove funding for the manure  efficiency technology scheme has also been condemned by the Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union, which described it as &ldquo;incomprehensible&rdquo;. It is  obvious that DARD has not fully consulted the farming industry; had it done so,  the condemnation that is coming from all quarters would not be warranted.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister got the criteria for the implementation of  tranche 1 funding disastrously wrong. I urge her to ensure that there are fair  and practical criteria for the implementation of tranche 2 funding so that  there is equality of opportunity for all farmers to avail themselves of that  welcome funding. I support the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Armstrong</strong>:  I declare an interest as a farmer and a member of the Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">All our farms, whether they are large or small, are  important and contribute to our local food industry, the countryside and the  economy. Farmers are a vital source of jobs in rural areas, whether they  provide full-time employment, as is the case with larger farms, or part-time  work, as is often the case with smaller enterprises in which the farmer often  has a second job.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As other Members said, there was criticism the last time  that applications for the scheme were taken, because there was a first come,  first served policy. The method of distribution this time has also come in for  criticism, because priority is being given to smaller farmers in less-favoured  areas. I do not dispute that farms in less-favoured areas are in need of  modernisation, but the same is true of all farms. By their very nature, larger  farms tend to be more productive, and it could be argued that the resources  should be spent on them, because that would have a greater impact on production  and on our economy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I would rather see the Minister opening the scheme to those  farmers who were unsuccessful last year to ensure that everyone has the chance  to benefit from at least one tranche of the funding.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">6.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development (Ms Gildernew)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a  LeasCheann Comhairle. I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion, which I  support. I am completely confident that the criteria that I am minded to bring  forward for tranche 2 are fair and practical and will deliver a good scheme  that will impact positively on the rural community, particularly on those  farmers who suffer permanent hardship.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Most of the proposed criteria that I have decided on  reflect what consultees said that they want to be introduced. For example, the  average age of farmers is higher than that of people in other industries in the  North of Ireland, and I suggest the awarding of marks to members of farm  businesses who are under 40 years of age in order to encourage young people to  continue with a career in farming. P J Bradley asked why I decided on people  under the age of 40; that is the EU definition of a young farmer. I  particularly want an emphasis on young farmers, and the Committee for  Agriculture and Rural Development and farming representatives have said that  succession planning should be a key criterion of this tranche, which it is.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Stakeholders have warmly welcomed e-communication, and  people realise that it will make the grant application quicker and easier. It  reflects our desire to make use of technology to further modernise the way that  we do business.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have asked my officials to meet industry representatives  to discuss the list of eligible items to ensure that it best reflects what farm  businesses want and need to help their farms to remain competitive. Those  meetings are scheduled to take place next week, and I hope that the industry  grasps the opportunity for consultation on eligible items, participates in  discussions and puts forward its views.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although I am pleased that NIAPA has agreed to attend, I am  disappointed to have received a letter from the president of the UFU on 3 March  2010 to indicate that it will disengage from assisting our discussion on the  banding of items for modernisation. However, I am pleased that the letter  suggests an additional 120 items for consideration at the meeting. With  reference to amendment No 1, I look forward to the UFU&rsquo;s reconsideration of its  position and its re-engagement with the process, and I support that amendment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">During the consultation process, my officials had  discussions with farming representatives and sought proposals for tranche 2 at  quite an early stage. Thereafter, they sought further views as soon as they  were able to clarify proposals and to put them to the monitoring committee and  other groups. We believe that consultation with the committee, the industry and  Europe was adequate. The fact that they do not  agree with all aspects of the scheme does not mean that they were not  consulted. The EU Commission was informed about the selection criteria before  Christmas and raised no objections to the proposals.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have listened to today&rsquo;s debate, and it seems that we  have forgotten the purpose of the scheme. It is a small grant scheme to help  farm businesses to modernise. It will not, and was never intended to, resolve  every difficulty that our farming industry faces. However, I hope that the list  of eligible items will offer some useful measures to help all sectors,  especially our hard-pressed poultry sector. It is a scheme to help farmers to  remain competitive.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Tranche 1 focused on introducing equipment for new  technologies and innovation. It included items to improve animal health and  welfare, to increase hygiene control and product storage, and to enhance  occupational safety, business efficiency and environmental status. A few of the  most purchased items were rubber slat mats, cow cubicles, cattle crush gates,  vermin-proof bulk feed bins, grass toppers, creep feeders and animal  identification collars. That is the reality of what the grant can provide. That  is what our farmers need for their businesses, and that is what I want to  provide again and to provide more of. I want this tranche to be opened as soon  as possible, because farmers need that help now, not next year. Therefore, let  us keep focusing on what is important: offering financial support to those who  need it most.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members have said that my intended focus on businesses in  severely disadvantaged areas is unfair and may be discriminatory. Perhaps it  would be helpful to reflect on the facts. Over 70% of all land that is farmed  in the North of Ireland is in a severely disadvantaged area (SDA) or a  disadvantaged area (DA), and many farms have a mix of land in areas that are  severely disadvantaged, disadvantaged and lowland. The markings that I consider  should be allocated to SDA, DA and lowland will enable all farmers to obtain  marks through working in a wide range of situations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is no discrimination, no sectarianism and no  unfairness. Indeed, Members will be aware that following consultation with the  rural development programme monitoring committee, the Agriculture Committee and  other stakeholders, I increased the suggested score for lowland areas from  nought to 10 marks.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also want to focus on some of the remarks that were made  in the media by an MLA who said that the scheme is in some way sectarian. I  totally reject that allegation. Others are trying to sectarianise the issue,  not me. As I said, 70% of our farmers live in less-favoured areas, and, as  Members have heard, farmers of small holdings come from all religions and none.  Let me be clear: my strongly held belief is that, in today&rsquo;s difficult economic  circumstances, tranche 2 is an opportunity for me to target disadvantage  through modernisation and to help smaller farm businesses that are working in a  very challenging environment, and facing poor agricultural conditions, to  remain competitive.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Without that type of targeted support, it will be very hard  for those farmers to sustain agricultural activity. For example, between  2002-03 and 2006-07, the level of farm income on SDA farms, after the LFA  payment, ranged between 54% and 61% of the farm income that was achieved on  lowland farms. That finding clearly demonstrates that the earning capacity of  SDA farms is much lower than that of farms in other areas. Therefore, those SDA  farmers require a boost to modernise and to help them to earn a better living.  To my mind, that is fair and practical. However, it is not true to say that  lowland farms will not benefit from tranche 2. Those farmers will attract a  score under tranche 2 for land classification and could score well on the  modernisation criteria and those relating to young farmers and e-communication.  No farmer in the North is prevented from applying to the scheme.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the past, some grants, such as the new entrants&rsquo; scheme,  benefited lowland farmers. Larger farm businesses, particularly dairy farms,  received aid from that scheme. I agree with Tom Elliott and other Members; the  word &ldquo;shambles&rdquo; was used to describe the first come, first served approach that  was taken last year, and it did not work well. Tom knows, as a UFU member, that  that approach was taken at the industry&rsquo;s request.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to clarify a point that was made by Willie McCrea.  The first tranche was not changed. Although the European spokesman made certain  comments about it, that tranche went ahead exactly as envisaged. Farmers for  whom more than 50% of their farm lay within an LFA accounted for 6,025  applications to tranche 1, but of those, only 713 were successful &mdash; a ratio of  8&middot;45 applications received to 1 successful application grant aided. If success  was in direct proportion to applications received, well over 100 more  applications would have come through. Although it was down to the luck of the  draw last time, it clearly demonstrates the need to be fair to those farm  businesses and to provide the financial support that they need. Furthermore, it  needs to be pointed out, as many Members have done today, that LFA farmers  contribute financially to the scheme through modulation. Their contribution of  voluntary modulation is estimated at around 65%. There is no question that  those farmers are entitled to benefit from the scheme.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Let us think a little more about the actual effect of the  funding from tranche 2. It was proposed that we should offer more farmers the  opportunity to avail themselves of a grant and the lower threshold. The average  farmer took up &pound;3,400 in tranche 1. Therefore, I feel that to meet the evidence  from tranche 1 and the views of stakeholders, tranche 2 should be limited to a  &pound;4,000 grant. Stakeholders also requested that the current minimum expenditure  be lowered. Therefore, I propose to lower it from &pound;1,000 to &pound;500. Depending on  how much of the &pound;4,000 on offer each successful applicant takes up, at least  1,600 farmers will be able to avail themselves of the scheme. That is a 40%  grant, so farmers have to find their 60% contribution. Overall, that will mean  that over &pound;15 million will be spent in total in rural areas. That will be of  huge assistance to a wide range of businesses in the North of Ireland, which is  very good news for the entire rural economy. We need to ensure that that  enormous benefit is secured as soon as possible. When the spend on tranche 1 is  completed, I hope that a figure of over &pound;10 million will have gone into the  economy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am aware that the funding in tranches 1 and 2 will not  satisfy all the demand that exists. Much as I would like to, I do not have the  funds to give a grant to all 27,000 farm businesses in the North, as some press  articles have claimed that I should. However, if we focus tranche 2 on SDA and  DA, we can at least assist small farmers in real need.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that there will be funds for a tranche 3, and I am  considering the opportunity for a further METS scheme this year that will focus  on where the need for that equipment and aid is greatest. Although there was a  high number of applicants to the METS scheme in the first tranche of the farm  modernisation programme, the actual take-up of financial support by those who  were awarded grants has been disappointing. The latest figures suggest that  over half of those farmers who received a letter of offer will not proceed with  the investment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The method of spread of slurry is an important factor in  addressing environmental commitments under the nitrates directive and the water  framework directive. I am prepared to consider the merits of a further tranche  of funding for METS and, subject to affordability, I hope that that might open  later this year. That would satisfy amendment No 2.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To some of the larger farmers, grant aid of &pound;4,000 may not  seem like a lot. However, for the smaller farmer, it can be a lifeline. To put  that in context, some of our larger farmers have over &pound;100,000 of single farm  payments, and a &pound;4,000 grant equates to around a fortnight&rsquo;s worth of single  farm payment. To the people who will apply for that funding and who need it  most &mdash; that is, the smaller farmers who are in hardship &mdash; it will be a  lifeline. They will still have to find the other 60% &mdash; &pound;6,000 &mdash; which will not  be easy for them in these challenging times, but they want to do that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want all farming areas, particularly those in the LFA, to  have the opportunity to develop and play their role in providing high-quality  raw material for the processing sectors. We need to try to keep our  agricultural sector buoyant and viable. It is important for everyone with an  interest in the farm modernisation programme to realise its potential benefit,  not just to farms but to manufacturers and suppliers of the equipment that will  be grant-aided. All that helps our economy: money will be in circulation and  jobs will be secured, perhaps even created. It is up to all of us to ensure  that we do not miss an opportunity and delay the opening of a scheme that can  deliver benefits, directly on the farm and to the manufacturing industry, and  indirectly to rural commerce.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some time ago, I met with the five local banks to ask them  to be more aware of the need to open up their loan portfolio to small rural  businesses that are trying to survive. I hope that that discussion will prove  useful. I want tranche 2 of the farm modernisation scheme to open in the  spring. As I said, it is my intention to try to fund another tranche next year.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, an equality impact assessment (EQIA) was carried  out on the whole of axis 1 at the beginning of the programme, which includes  the farm modernisation programme. The formal consultation period for the EQIA  began on 10 August 2007 and ended on 2 November 2007. Fourteen responses were  received from groups and individuals. In addition, rural development division  met 18 equality groups during the pre-consultation stage to inform them about  the EQIA and the rural development programme generally.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In total, 108 separate comments or recommendations were  received during consultation. Five EQIA roadshows, each comprising two  information sessions, were held at locations across the North of Ireland during  October 2007 to provide more information about the EQIA and to encourage  responses. Copies of the EQIA document were sent out to organisations  representing all aspects of society. The EQIA was also widely advertised in the  media, and copies of the document could be downloaded from the DARD website or  requested in hard copy over the phone.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The final report of the EQIA, which covers axes 1 and 3,  was published on 17 July 2009. That is available to download from the  Department&rsquo;s website. During the recent consultation period on the proposed  tranche 2 selection criteria, concerns were expressed that lowland farmers &mdash;  the majority of whom are Protestants and likely to be of a unionist political  opinion &mdash; would be excluded from funding. There were also concerns that older  farmers may be disadvantaged through the proposed succession opportunity  criterion. I requested that my officials carry out an equality screening  exercise on the selection criteria of tranche 2. That will be brought to the  attention of our section 75 consultees and stakeholders.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Minister to draw her remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: If there are any significant equality  issues that we are unaware of, I would like the consultees to bring them to our  attention before the end of the consultation period, and we will take their  concerns on board.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">7.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Minister&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: My proposals provide a fair and  practical scheme that will deliver many benefits for those living and working  in the rural community.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I call Mr Ian Paisley Jnr to wind up on amendment No 1.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  I congratulate the Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone Mr Elliott for getting  this motion on the Order Paper, and my colleague and Mr Bradley for their  amendments, which we welcome as they add to the substance of the motion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The matter that we are discussing ought not to be a  contentious issue. Indeed, we should be able to welcome unanimously the  Department&rsquo;s position in any debate on it. At the end of the day, the money  should be about developing farms and helping farms to move forward. It should  not be divisive in any way, and, therefore, it is unfortunate that we are in a  position in which division exists.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Ford indicated the nub of the issue and the reason why  there is division: there has been a breakdown in consultation. If tonight&rsquo;s  debate is about anything, it is about consultation or the lack thereof. It is  about a breakdown in the relationship with one of the key stakeholders involved  in that consultation, namely the Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s saying that she will support the  motion and the amendments. However, I urge the Minister to move beyond  supporting the principles that are outlined in the motion. They are good  principles and issues that we should not be divided on, but she should go  further and open afresh the consultation with the Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union and the  Committee to try to take matters forward to a more positive and unanimous  conclusion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have members of the Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union  &mdash; indeed, its executive committee &mdash; in the Public Gallery. How much better  would their time be spent negotiating with the officials and the Minister to  find a way forward on which we have unanimity? That would be time well spent. I  hope that the words that we have heard tonight from the Minister, on behalf of  the Department, are words of encouragement that that consultation can be opened  up, that there is a chink of light, that we can move forward and that we can  get a more positive conclusion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When all the talk and debate is cut aside, all that is  being asked for is a narrowing of the gap between those in SDAs, DAs and  lowlands. I say that as a Member who represents an area, North   Antrim, that benefits from the way that the Minister has cut her  cloth on this matter. If that gap could be narrowed, we would have a position  in which the breakdown in communication and consultation could be healed and we  could move forward on a positive footing. Therefore, I welcome the positive approach  that the Minister and her party have taken in responding to the matter  positively by saying that they want to get a fair outcome. We want that fair  outcome, but let us make it a practical move that brings about agreement on a  way forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I call on the Minister to look at two matters. The first is  negotiations with the UFU on the METS scheme, which she has already identified.  I welcome that. I also want her to see whether there is another way of getting  more money into the scheme in the first instance. We should be able to welcome  the scheme, because it is a benefit in bringing about modernisation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am not speaking as Chairman of the Committee but as a  member of the Committee and a Member of the Assembly. The Committee has a good  working relationship with DARD, with the Minister and the officials. There is  also a good working relationship between DARD officials and the Ulster Farmers&rsquo;  Union. However, there is a healthy tension,  and that is good. We should get to a position where that healthy tension results  in a positive outcome and an agreement. I would like to see that, and,  therefore, I urge the Minister to try to close the gap between the lowland  farmers, the SDAs and the DAs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, I would like to put on record a note that appeared  in &lsquo;Farm Week&rsquo; from one of the farmers in an SDA in my constituency. He  outlines very clearly the controversy and division among the farming community  that happens when money has to be rationed. I support young farmers and the  advantages that they should receive, but we need a scheme that gives all  farmers a chance to claim back money that has been appropriated from them. If  we could get to that point, we could get some sort of agreement. We could learn  from the breakdown that has occurred over this scheme and move forward on a  healthy basis.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Member for proposing the motion, and I look  forward to this matter getting a fair wind in the days ahead.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Mr Paisley was making a winding-up speech in support of amendment  No 2, not amendment No 1, as I said. I call Patsy McGlone to make a winding-up  speech for amendment No 1.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Ulster Unionist Party  for introducing the motion. My party entirely supports the bringing forward of:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;fair and practical criteria for the implementation&rdquo; ,</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">not &ldquo;with a view to&rdquo; doing something about the  situation, but to actually do something about it. I hope that that clarifies  the point to that party&rsquo;s satisfaction.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I listened carefully to Mr Elliott as he outlined the  problems and difficulties that occurred last year. No one in this Chamber or  elsewhere wants to see people queuing outside DARD offices, waiting for money  that never comes, as happened then. That episode was referred to as &ldquo;the soup  kitchens&rdquo;. Large sections of the community got no support from the scheme.  Farmers and their families were disappointed. However, Mr Elliott referred also  to the criteria for the severely disadvantaged areas, the proposed  classifications and the disadvantages arising from them, the degree of  modernisation, and the exploration of other avenues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A consistent theme throughout the debate has been the need  for further dialogue with the farming organisations. That is the purpose and  basis of my party&rsquo;s amendment, which was proposed very eloquently by my  colleague P J Bradley, who suggested that such consultation was in line. I  thank the Chairperson of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development,  Mr Paisley Jnr, for drawing that to our attention and conceding that point.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I pay tribute to P J Bradley, who was with the farmers in  his area and witnessed at first hand the difficulties that the previous funding  episode created. People spent up to 60 hours queuing outside DARD offices, and  that is not a place that anyone would want to be. It could be entirely summed  up by the quotation:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;For many are called, but few are chosen.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">P J Bradley stressed the need for further consultation with  UFU/NIAPA and especially with the Agriculture and Rural Development Committee,  which should be rather more than a statutory consultee. That point needs to be  stressed: the Committee is the legislative consultee and the elected consultee  of the people of the North. All Departments should work more closely with their  Assembly Committees and consult them, rather than dump such matters on them at  the last minute.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Among other issues raised was the question of whether the  measure had been equality proofed. The Minister did not clarify that point. If  legal advice was provided to the Department, can it be shared with the  Agriculture and Rural Development Committee? The Minister ought to use such  information to assure Members that advice was sought and to give elected  Members confidence that the project has been given some thought and that we  will not find ourselves in unwelcome territory as we did last year.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Irwin referred to the need for the programme to be a  success and to unhappiness with tranche 2 of the programme in his constituency.  I heard the word &ldquo;equality&rdquo; bounced around this Chamber as never before. If the  debate on this programme leads to equality becoming a linchpin of the Assembly,  that is to be welcomed. Perhaps we can hear more of it. However, I am sure that  that will arise in other contexts, particularly in tomorrow&rsquo;s debate on the  devolution of policing and justice.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In support of the motion, reference was made to creating a  level playing field. Mr Doherty referred to the meeting with the UFU on 9  February 2010, at which issues were raised. Mr Ford called for further  consultation, and he supported the motion and the amendments. Mr W McCrea  outlined the steps and requirements needed to deal with this issue, and he  emphasised the need for re-engagement with the Agriculture and Rural  Development Committee and stakeholders&rsquo; groups. He, too, referred to the need  for equality.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We then heard from Mr Molloy, and the issue of equality  again emerged. We received a wee bit of a necessary history lesson, which I  accept. When he moved on to the redistribution of wealth, however, I was not  too sure whether I was listening to Mr Molloy or Mr Marx.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Bring your remarks to a close, please.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  However, I am sure that we could listen to that again. Something was mentioned  &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Your time is up. I am sorry, Mr McGlone.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  During the course &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Your time is up.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  I am sorry. OK. Thank you very much.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I thank all Members who contributed to the debate, which was wide ranging. I  start by declaring an interest in some of the matters that were raised. I am a  member of the Young Farmers&rsquo; Clubs of Ulster and of the Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union. I am under 40, I am a Presbyterian, and I received  money from the new entrants&rsquo; scheme. I did not receive any money from tranche  1, and because I am a lowland farmer, I am not likely to receive any from  tranche 2. However, I do not think that I was moved anywhere during the Plantation, which also  got a mention.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My colleague Mr Elliott opened the debate by criticising  how tranche 1 was handled. The Minister agreed with and accepted that point,  and admitted that there were difficulties. Mr Elliott went on to talk about an  equality impact assessment. As other Members mentioned, equality was talked  about a lot today. It is strange that the very party that prides itself in  always talking about equality seems to be doing the least about it today. The  Minister may have to be sent back to Connolly House for retraining.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Elliott mentioned other groups, including the hill  farming group, which were opposed to the programme because of some of the  payments to less-favoured areas. He mentioned the under-40 group, which I  personally support. I have already declared that I am in that age bracket. He  also questioned some of the scoring for the eligible items, which the Minister  said would be looked at.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  Although we appreciate that the Minister indicated that she will consult on the  eligible items, there was no indication that she would consult on any of the  rest of the issues. That gives me concern, and, I am sure, my colleague.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I share those concerns. If, at any point, the Minister wants to make a  clarification, I will happily take an intervention from her.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">P J Bradley spoke about the state of farming, and said that  we need to contribute much to farm modernisation. It is always worth reminding  the House that agrifood is the biggest private-sector employer in Northern Ireland, makes a huge contribution to  the economy of Northern    Ireland, and is, obviously, the backbone of  our rural communities. Farms do, therefore, need that support. Mr Bradley  mentioned the huge sums that were taken from single farm payments via  modulation, both the voluntary &mdash; well, the not-so voluntary &mdash; and the  completely compulsory.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Irwin, in moving amendment No 1, welcomed the programme  and its contribution to rural areas. He spoke about inequality for lowland  farmers, and I agree that such inequality exists. He spoke about METS funding,  and getting a better system in place to deal with the second tranche of the  programme.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Doherty, in support of the motion, wanted a level  playing field, but it seems that how level the playing field is depends on  whether the field is in a less-favoured area or a lowland area. There was broad  support for the marking and weighting system to be looked at again. The points  system weighs too heavily against lowland farmers.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">7.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Ford said that there has been insufficient consultation  on the matter. He welcomed some of the modernisation elements of the programme,  including those that award marks to the under 40s and online applications. Dr  McCrea expressed grave concerns about the unacceptable and discriminatory  nature of the proposals, and he said that they need to be looked at.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although the debate has been fairly good-natured, Mr  Molloy&rsquo;s remarks about meetings in Orange Halls somehow gearing up unionist and  Protestant communities were particularly offensive and unhelpful. Mr Shannon  spoke about a postcode lottery, which is what the scheme will become if we do  not do something to narrow the gap in the scoring system. Mr Savage and Mr  Burns were unhappy with the scoring system in the land classification element  of the programme. It comes back to the very crux of the land classification  issue, which is that the gap in the scoring is too wide. Indeed, that matter  keeps coming up.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Willie Clarke spoke about the need to get money into rural  areas. There was general agreement that that is right and very important.  However, he went on to defend the way in which funds are targeted at  disadvantaged and severely disadvantaged areas. That comes back to our view  that the current criteria need to be wider, because under the current plans, it  is almost impossible for a lowland farmer to meet them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are always hoping to hear some good news from the  Minister. At least she held the door open for some of the issues. I hope that  she takes the opportunity to do whatever she can to engage with stakeholders  where possible to get the problem sorted. We have a good programme that is  worthwhile for our industry. Of course, we would all like to see more money  dedicated to the programme and sent quickly to farms so that they can be  helped. The Minister spoke about helping smaller farms and how such help can be  almost like a lifeline for them. Everyone in this House will welcome getting  money into the rural communities and the farming sector, but we have to do that  in the best possible way. I am afraid that we do not agree with the weighting  that has been given to land classification. Therefore, it has to be changed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some of the Minister&rsquo;s comments, such as the speed at which  the scheme will move, were welcome. It is good that the application forms will  be kept as simple and as easy to manage as possible. That was very welcome in  the tranche 1 funding. The Minister said that an equality impact assessment was  carried out on the rural development programme, but no equality impact  assessment was carried out on the farm modernisation scheme.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I said that an EQIA was carried out. The  Member asserted that mine is the party that defends equality. That is  absolutely right: we do defend equality, and we will do so to the hilt. We have  a situation in which the gap in farming is wide, and we want to address that.  We also have an obligation to tackle disadvantage and inequality. I make no  apology for wanting to do that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I reiterate that consultation took place. Although the UFU  does not support the proposals, as the Member heard already, NIAPA and the  National Beef Association do support them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have consulted widely. In fact, in its evidence to the  Agriculture Committee, the UFU said that even five points in the assessment  would help. I responded by giving 10 points to lowland farmers. Therefore, I  have been listening to and engaging with our stakeholders. I welcome and  respect the fact that they do have a very &mdash;</p>

    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly notes the introduction of a boiler  scrappage scheme by HM Government and calls on the Minister for Social Development  to examine the scope for the future introduction of a similar scheme in  Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic"><span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. Members should leave the Chamber quietly.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To set the debate in context, I acknowledge that between  the motion being tabled and the Business Committee choosing it for debate, the  Department for Social Development (DSD) has responded positively to a request  from the Social Development Committee, of which I am Chairperson, for a boiler  scrappage scheme for Northern    Ireland to be examined. I want to put that  on record, and also that correspondence from the Department to the Committee  outlines:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Department is currently working on a review of  the fuel poverty strategy, and one of the areas they are looking at is a boiler  replacement or boiler scrappage scheme.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Therefore, I acknowledge and commend the progress  that the Department is making.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Most Members will recall that the boiler scrappage scheme  was one of the few positive headline-grabbing initiatives in the Chancellor&rsquo;s  pre-Budget statement in December 2009. Most Members should also be aware that  the scheme proposed a payment in England of &pound;400 to help people to  convert from energy efficiency G-rated boilers to A-rated boilers. That was  widely heralded at the time and it received much positive press coverage.  However, the nature of our devolved arrangements meant that the initiative  would not automatically be rolled out to Scotland,  Wales or Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, I acknowledge the progress that the Department  has already made on the issue. The debate affords Members an opportunity to  support the idea of a boiler scrappage scheme and to encourage the Department  to introduce such a scheme in Northern    Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Undoubtedly, a boiler scrappage scheme would provide a  plethora of benefits, many of which Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government outlined when they  proposed their scheme for England.  Broadly speaking, three key advantages can be identified: energy efficiency,  carbon reduction, and enhancing the economy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Replacing a G-rated boiler with an A-rated one improves  energy efficiency. A G-rated boiler is the worst of the worst. For every &pound;1 of  oil that such a boiler consumes, around 50p is literally wasted. Money is being  burned. On average, each household in England that has switched from a  G-rated boiler to an A-rated boiler saves &pound;235 a year, so one can see how the  &pound;400 cash incentive per household is recouped within two years. Moreover,  energy-efficient boilers continue to perform at the optimum rate, so those  reductions remain in subsequent years. In a climate in which erratic energy  prices are the norm, having an energy-efficient boiler, which does not burn  money, is of great assistance to people and affords them certainty and control  over their energy bills.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is anticipated that, in its lifetime, the English scheme  will result in the replacement of approximately 125,000 boilers. That will  reduce CO2 emissions by approximately 14,000 tons, which, I am reliably  informed, is equivalent to taking 45,000 cars off the road. That is the impact  that the scheme will have on the environment, and we are all acutely aware of  the importance of that argument.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The economic advantages of a boiler scrappage scheme are  often overlooked but are equally important, because introducing such a scheme  would boost and incentivise a certain sector of the economy. Not only are there  a great number of boiler manufacturers in the United   Kingdom, including some in Northern Ireland, but there are a  great many plumbers and boiler installers who such a scheme would advantage.  Therefore, by investing a relatively small amount of money, as well as  providing energy-efficiency and carbon-reduction benefits, a short-term,  targeted boost to the economy can be achieved. The advantages of a boiler  scrappage scheme are transparently obvious.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The real advantage of a boiler scrappage scheme, however,  is in seeking to tackle fuel poverty in Northern Ireland. As I am sure the  Minister will outline later, the Department is focusing its attention on how  such a scheme might further reduce fuel poverty. I do not need to rehearse the  arguments about fuel poverty. Members sit with a sense of shame as a result of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s having among the highest  level of fuel poverty in the United    Kingdom, if not in western Europe. Around  one in three households here suffers from fuel poverty, and we all know the  shocking headlines when one drills down to the figures: half of those who  suffer from fuel poverty are pensioners, and around 40% of households in fuel  poverty have children. Those statistics are a cause of shame for everyone in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Efforts have been made to reduce those numbers through the  warm homes scheme and the Housing Executive&rsquo;s heating replacement scheme for  its existing housing stock, and we acknowledge that positive work. However, a  certain section of society is still very difficult to reach in order to help it  out of, or, in some cases, to prevent it from slipping into, fuel poverty. The  people who belong to that section of society can be described as the working  poor: the great mass of people who, although they work hard, do not qualify for  benefits and, therefore, are not entitled to benefit from the warm homes  scheme. Nonetheless, they are in fuel poverty.<span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">7.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The data in the 2006 house condition survey, which is where  the 34% in fuel poverty figure comes from, show that around 12,000 households  have a household income of &pound;20,000 or more. Indeed, 4,390 households that are  estimated to be in fuel poverty have an income of &pound;30,000 or more. An income of  &pound;30,000 is well above the Northern    Ireland average, yet those people are still  in fuel poverty. I do not wish to make a sweeping generalisation, but I will  hazard a guess that the vast majority of those houses would not qualify or be  in receipt of qualifying benefits that would entitle them to the warm homes  scheme. Therefore, they are a difficult to reach group, but they are in fuel  poverty. The reason that they are in fuel poverty is, by and large, that they  are spending 10% of their income, which is in excess of &pound;3,000, on fuel. People  might feel sometimes that they are filling their oil tank every other week and  that they are spending a clean fortune on their fuel, but &pound;3,000 is a lot of  money to spend in a year. Therefore, I suggest that the very reason that those  individuals are in fuel poverty is that their boiler and heating system are  inefficient. Therefore, a boiler scrappage scheme that is targeted particularly  at those people would take them out of fuel poverty. Such a scheme could also  be very effective for similar groups of people who may be at risk of slipping  into fuel poverty.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am not personally hung up on what sort of system we  should introduce in Northern    Ireland. We could replicate the system that  is in place in England,  which has now been adopted in Scotland,  but that would not be particularly focused on fuel poverty. We could go for  what the Welsh have done, which is to target the scheme at people who are over  60, or we could come up with a Northern    Ireland innovation that suits our needs; and  we have real needs in respect of fuel poverty. Therefore, a boiler scrappage  scheme that is targeted at tackling fuel poverty could be quite successful.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Obviously, there is a resource issue. I understand that an  amendment has been tabled. I am not sure whether it will be moved, but it calls  for the scheme to be brought in immediately. I am not sure that the Minister  has the money to introduce it immediately. She is shaking her head vigorously  to indicate that she does not, but I would hazard a guess that the Minister  needs time to develop a scheme as well as to find the money. I would not get  particularly hung up about the quantum of money. If it is a good scheme and it  is worth doing, even if we find a small pot that can be adapted to do some good  work and to tackle that need, it is better than nothing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is an opportunity to do something off the back of the  scheme that was introduced in England  and adopted elsewhere in the other devolved regions of the UK. The warm  homes scheme is in place for people who are on certain benefits and there are  heating replacement programmes for people in Housing Executive properties, but  there is nothing for the working poor. That group of people do not qualify for  the warm homes scheme, but they are every bit as much in fuel poverty as  anybody else. There is a unique opportunity for the Assembly to endorse that  principle today and let the Department analyse what is possible in Northern Ireland and bring forward a scheme that  will help tackle fuel poverty in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The following amendment stood on the Marshalled List:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">Leave out &ldquo;future&rdquo; and insert &ldquo;immediate&rdquo;. &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Mr Armstrong.]</span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Amendment not moved.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  I had intended to say something about the amendment, but the Member has pulled  the carpet from under my feet.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion. There has been quite a lot of debate  about the boiler scrappage scheme since it was introduced elsewhere. I was  going to say that, although the amendment calls on the Minister to implement  the scheme immediately, we need to step back, take a deep breath and look at  what is happening in other jurisdictions to ensure that we get a scheme that  fits here. The offer of &pound;400 for each household that wishes to change its  heating system could, if used in the right way, help towards the replacement of  outdated and environmentally unfriendly heating systems. The Savills report  highlighted the fact that more than 14,000 houses do not reach the decent homes  standard, and, of those, 11,000 failed the test due to inefficient heating  systems.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We must ask what procedures will be put in place to ensure  that the system is made easy for those who wish to tap into a grant and ensure  that they are not bogged down in bureaucratic delays and application forms,  which put off those who need assistance from applying. If the scheme is to be  taken on, it needs to be targeted at those who are most in need and who,  because of their financial situation, cannot afford to replace their heating  system.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I was shocked but not surprised to find out from the  information supplied that major energy companies had been involved in the  superinflation of prices. The worst of those mentioned was British Gas. The  research highlighted the fact that many of those major companies also said that  they would give an additional &pound;400 towards the price of replacing the systems,  but the prices quoted cancelled out the &pound;400 grant and the additional &pound;400 from  the companies. An article in an English newspaper stated that a customer  received a quote of &pound;5,012 from British Gas and, after deducting both  allowances, was asked to pay over &pound;4,200. That is way outside the financial  range of many people. Unless we get it right before the implementation of any  scheme, confusion will reign. We need to ensure that people are not being asked  to pay above the odds. The article said that there is already confusion about  how the scheme works in England.  Quotes that were received from local plumbers were almost &pound;2,000 cheaper than  those of the multinationals. We must ensure that major companies are not  allowed to abuse the system.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We should examine the possibility of the boiler scrappage  scheme being handled through the warm homes scheme. I take on board the  Committee Chairperson&rsquo;s comments, but surely a scheme such as the warm homes  scheme, which targets the systems towards those who are most in need, could be  stretched to take in the working poor. The warm homes scheme deals with those  who are most in need, and it would allow grants to be targeted at those people.  That scheme is up and running. If we have control of the administration of the  warm homes scheme, we can tailor it to allow it to administer the boiler  scrappage scheme. Alternatively, could the Housing Executive not begin the process  of not maintaining the out-of-date systems of people with medical problems who  are refused help with the maintenance of their heating system and replacing  them with environmentally safe systems, which will protect not only those in  need but the environment?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burns</strong>: I  support the motion, and I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on the  boiler scrappage scheme. It was first introduced in England,  and it has since been introduced in Scotland  and Wales.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the introduction of a boiler replacement scheme.  It came as a surprise to many when the plans for such a scheme were announced  in the Chancellor&rsquo;s pre-Budget report. When I heard about the scheme, I thought  that it was a good idea to give people &pound;400 towards the cost of a new boiler,  and I am fairly sure that there will not be much disagreement on that in the  House, especially if someone else is paying. If the Finance Minister gives the  Minister for Social Development the required money, few people will disagree  with his decision.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Other Members said that the scheme has been a great success  in England,  and they are right. It is a good idea. I can see the advantages of such a  replacement scheme: the new technology is much better; new boilers increase  fuel efficiency, reduce energy bills and have much lower emission levels; and  there is the added bonus of a cash injection to the local plumbing and heating  industry.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is my understanding that we are not under any obligation  to have exactly the same scheme as England,  Scotland or Wales. If we  were thinking about introducing the same scheme as in England, it  would be only to help the environment. Would it be the responsibility of the  DOE and not DSD? If a scheme were to be introduced here, given the level of  fuel poverty here, I would call for it to be targeted directly at the  households that are in fuel poverty. It would be much better for the boiler  replacement scheme to be part of the warm homes scheme, under the supervision  of the Minister for Social Development.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not want a first come, first served voucher scheme for  people who have a few thousand pounds to invest and are upgrading the  underfloor heating in their second bathroom and need a more powerful boiler.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Is that your house, Tommy?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burns</strong>:  No, it is not. Households in fuel poverty and on low incomes are not doing that  sort of thing. They are far more likely to have a basic boiler that is on its  last legs. Therefore, I say to the Minister that it would be better if her  Department would make a much more significant contribution and pay at least  half, if not all, of the cost to households that badly need new boilers but  cannot afford them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The idea of a boiler replacement scheme is worthy of  careful consideration. I know that the Minister will give it the attention that  it requires. The SDLP and, indeed, all parties in the House are strongly  committed to helping the most needy and vulnerable people. I am sure that the  Assembly will not miss the opportunity to help once again the people who need  it most.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: I  support the motion. In comparison with people in Great   Britain, people in Northern Ireland are more likely to  live in fuel poverty, because of the lower average income and the higher cost  of energy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s fuel poverty strategy aims to  eliminate fuel poverty in vulnerable households by 2010 and in non-vulnerable  households by 2016. The strategy is due to be reviewed shortly. It is  imperative that meaningful ways are sought to help those who are most in need.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">England  introduced a boiler scrappage scheme in January to encourage homeowners to  replace their old boilers with more efficient, A-rated boilers in order to  reduce CO2 emissions and heating costs by up to a quarter. As with the car  scrappage scheme, it also aims to boost the economy during the current  recession. Likewise, in February, the Scottish and Welsh Governments announced  their commitment to implement similar schemes, albeit with different criteria.  In Wales,  the scheme will be targeted at the over-60s. It is important that Northern Ireland&rsquo;s scheme replicates one of the  models in England, Scotland and Wales so that households here are  not left behind and benefit from that initiative.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The scheme in England does not aim to reduce fuel  poverty; it benefits only people who can afford the large cost to install a new  boiler, rather than people who struggle to meet their heating bills on low  incomes or benefits. I support National Energy Action Northern Ireland&rsquo;s call  for a boiler scrappage scheme that targets people who are at greatest risk of  suffering fuel poverty: older people, young families, people with disabilities  and people who are chronically ill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The DSD warm homes plus scheme offers insulation and  heating measures to homeowners and private tenants who receive qualifying  benefits if they use Economy 7, solid fuel or bottled gas for heating or have  no heating system at all. In Northern    Ireland, more than 70% of homes use oil  heating. The warm homes plus scheme can be extended to include a boiler  scrappage element to help people who have oil-fired boilers that are now old  and inefficient but who, under the current warm homes plus criteria, are not  eligible to have their boiler replaced.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Housing Executive tenants would be omitted under the scheme  as it exists in England,  which applies to homeowners or private tenants. Housing Executive tenants have  presented themselves to my constituency office as suffering from fuel poverty  due to the high cost of having to operate inefficient Economy 7 heating  systems. A new boiler scrappage scheme should include Housing Executive tenants  in order to reduce their heating bills. During winter, constituents came into  my office whose boilers had totally broken down due to the cold weather. Under  the scheme as it stands in England,  those people would not benefit because applicants who are under 60 years of age  must have boilers that are in full working order.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I received a briefing from the Scottish and  Northern Ireland Plumbing Employers&rsquo; Federation. It says that it has already  received enquiries about those new initiatives. Obviously, it supports a scheme  in Northern Ireland.  However, it warns that we need to think about other costs, not just the cost to  replace the boiler. That involves other costs, such as a new control panel. It  also suggests that instead of just axing the lowest grade &mdash; the G grade &mdash; we  should expand the range to include the E and F grades, as they are fairly  inefficient. It is essential that we include a wider range in the scheme, and I  would support such a proposal.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">7.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hilditch</strong>:  I welcome the motion. Along with the Chairperson, I acknowledge the Minister&rsquo;s  commitment to the matter since the motion was tabled.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If we are serious about reducing fuel poverty and CO2  emissions, it is time for Northern Ireland  to consider a boiler scrappage scheme similar to that initiated in England. The  scheme there allows households with the least efficient boilers to claim &pound;400  towards a new boiler. That scheme is targeting around 125,000 households who  own or privately rent their homes. If a such a scheme were introduced here, and  I hope that it is, it would have the potential to benefit around 75,000 homes  throughout Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The scheme is designed to encourage people to replace  inefficient boilers that are likely to be around 15 years old. New boilers have  rated efficiencies of 90% or more, meaning that they use less fuel, which  results in lower CO2 emissions and running costs. Renewable heat technologies  do not use fossil fuels. If we upgrade a G-rated boiler to an A-rated boiler,  household heating bills should drop by about one quarter, which is an average  saving of around &pound;235 a year.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In England,  people under 60 years of age can apply for the scheme if their boiler is in  working order and it is the main source of heat for their home. Those who are  over 60 years of age can apply for the scheme regardless of whether their  boiler works or not. However, it still needs to be the main boiler used in the  home. I am not sure whether I agree entirely with those criteria. I see no  reason why people over 60 years of age should be eligible for the scheme if  their boiler is in perfectly good working order. However, that is a matter for England. To  apply, one must either be a homeowner or a private tenant. Landlords of  multiple properties can apply, as long as each voucher is assigned to a  different property. Registered social landlords and housing associations cannot  apply as they are covered by alternative support in the English scheme.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Replacing old boilers has the potential to slash household  energy bills and carbon emissions, while providing an important boost to our  heating industry. It will help to secure jobs in small and medium-sized  businesses that form a vital component of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s low-carbon  economy. The scheme will show how our Government continue to invest in our  industries and in jobs for the future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Given the fact that Northern Ireland has the highest rate  of fuel poverty in the United Kingdom, with one in three households suffering  its effects, I urge the Minister to consider the proposal seriously and to  introduce it sooner rather than later. Our vulnerable households need most  help. Higher energy prices have led to an increase in the number of households  in fuel poverty. There are many benefits to Northern Ireland&rsquo;s economy if we  reduce our heating costs. Effectively, if people are not paying for more gas or  heating oil, that money is at their disposal and can help the local economy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Small companies and businesses here are struggling for  sales to survive, and the scheme has the potential to help them to boost their  sales. The collapse in house building has hit our heating industries hard, and  this is their chance to secure work. It will also help our unemployment  figures, and it has the potential to increase the number of apprenticeship  placements. Companies will be encouraged to become more competitive, with  special offers involving complementary deals to entice people to use them when  scrapping or replacing a boiler.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, we need to be mindful of the disadvantages of the  scheme. Some companies in England  have taken advantage of the scheme and have overpriced boilers and installation  work. That puts our vulnerable people at even greater risk, and it makes a  mockery of the proposal. Some modern boilers are not built to last in the way  in which old boilers were, and it has been known for them to burn out after 10  years. Some boilers that are 15 years old work perfectly well and, therefore,  there would be no need for some people over 60 years of age to replace their  boiler. I encourage the Minister to be mindful of those flaws when looking at  ways in which the scheme can be implemented.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This winter alone has taken its toll on those who cannot  afford to heat their home sufficiently or, in some cases, at all. Northern Ireland  still has at least 1,000 cold-related deaths every winter, and the figure is  likely to be nearer 1,300. Being fuel poor seems to be worse than just being  poor. To make matters worse, it will be 30 years before we address all the  households that need to be in the warm homes scheme. The pace of the present  assistance simply is not fast enough, and I urge the Minister to look at the  daunting figures. The message is blunt: if people cannot afford to keep warm,  they will get ill and die of cold. It is time to figure out fuel poverty once  and for all, and the scheme is another way to help. We simply cannot wait any  longer.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I had other comments to make on the amendment, which has  now not been moved. I support the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Like everybody who spoke today, I  am happy to see the motion brought before the House. Before I speak to the  motion, I wish Margaret, Anna, Loretta, Mairead and any other women in the  Assembly this evening a happy International Women&rsquo;s Day.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We were in the Long Gallery this morning at an  International Women&rsquo;s Day event, meeting women from all sections of society.  The main focus was on how the Assembly works, how politics works for them and  how women can get involved in politics. During the round-table discussions,  many of the women, who were of all ages and from all backgrounds, raised the  perception of this place and what is done about the issues that affect people&rsquo;s  everyday lives. The feedback that I was given today &mdash; I am sure that members of  other political parties received the same feedback &mdash; was that sometimes there  is no business brought before the Assembly that can affect people&rsquo;s lives. This  is one motion to which we can point &mdash; we used it today as an example &mdash; to say  that, if a scoping exercise takes place and a scheme is implemented, it will  indeed affect people&rsquo;s lives, for all the reasons that Members have outlined.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The North has extremely high levels of poverty as well as  many people on disability benefits. David, in his final remarks, mentioned the  links between poverty and ill health. I was talking to two ladies this morning  who are carers. We have had a particularly bad winter. They would now consider  themselves poor and living on the poverty line, even though they have worked  all their lives. They are living on pensions. They were saying that, if it is  bad enough for them trying to heat the house on their wages, what is it like  for people who are less well off, particularly when they are looking after  people who are unwell. Judging by the sound of the conditions, they are looking  after people with long-term or perhaps terminal illnesses.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The other thing that has to be commended is that progress  seems to have been made with the Minister and the Department taking the issue  on board. I was pleased that the Ulster Unionist Party did not move its  amendment, because &mdash; I just had a quick glance &mdash; it looked like an amendment  for the sake of it. From the excellent information that we received from the  Assembly research service, it is clear that it is very complex. There is some  stuff on England.  There are concerns in Scotland  and Wales  about what should be brought forward. There is a need to consider local issues  and the conditions that people are living in locally and to feed that into any  scheme that is introduced. I assume that the Minister will be feeding that into  her comments. For example, some places here in the North do not have access to  gas, which is a difficulty in itself. Anna spoke about Economy 7, and the  Chairperson of the Social Development Committee, Simon Hamilton, raised a point  in relation to oil. That was one of the issues that came up today. It is a  common conversation among most of us that it seems that only a matter of weeks  after filling an oil tank it has to be refilled. The boiler replacement scheme  could save households at least &pound;240. Even some of the stuff that the Northern  Ireland Council for Voluntary Action (NICVA) brought forward suggested that up  to 50% of households could benefit from that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am also intrigued about the local employment aspect of  the scheme. Although there was some fraud in England among people who were  working under the scheme, if there were local and social labour clauses  included in the scheme, whereby there were strict criteria that there must be  benefits for apprenticeships and training, that would certainly reduce the  prospect of fraud and assist certain local opportunities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This is a good motion. It is a pity that the debate has  taken place late in the evening; nonetheless, all political parties have given  their support to it. I look forward to hearing the Minister&rsquo;s comments on how  the issue will be taken forward. I have no doubt that most of the women whom we  spoke to today will read the Hansard report tomorrow, because they informed us  that they will do so to find out how the debate went.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Draw your remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  I will, surely. This is one example of all Members speaking from the same page.  I support the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>: I  support the motion. In Northern Ireland,  heating bills are approximately one third higher than anywhere else in the United Kingdom.  Fuel poverty is, therefore, more likely to be a factor here than in any other  part of the United Kingdom.  In addition, incomes in Northern Ireland  are lower than those in the rest of the UK, and that heightens the prospect  of fuel poverty here. People who are in fuel poverty are defined as people who  spend more than 10% of their annual income on fuel. Given the recent cold  weather, which is continuing, many people in Northern Ireland are suffering.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I praise the Minister and the Executive for providing  people who are experiencing difficulties with their heating bills with some  extra help this winter. The warm homes scheme in Northern Ireland is a good idea,  and it has already helped thousands of people. However, the eligibility  criteria are highly restrictive. To qualify, an applicant must be in receipt of  one of the following benefits: income support, income-related employment and  support allowance, income-based jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, pension credit, child  tax credit, working tax credit, disability living allowance, attendance  allowance, housing benefit and rates rebate. We must accept, therefore, that  the scheme misses out many people who are not in receipt of benefits but are on  a low income and are experiencing the effects of fuel poverty. In fact, in the  current financial year, the number of successful applicants to the warm homes  scheme has plummeted compared with previous years. That is because of the  adoption of new criteria, which, as I stated earlier, are clearly restrictive.  The warm homes scheme is proving to be ineffective, as take-up has fallen. How  many people are being left out and are suffering from fuel poverty as a result?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The boiler scrappage scheme, which is currently available  in England,  offers many benefits. It reduces household carbon emissions, which helps to  meet the emissions targets that are set in Europe  and further afield. It reduces household heating bills and increases heating  efficiency. In England,  the Government invested &pound;200 million to improve energy efficiency and tackle  fuel poverty by offering &pound;400 to up to 125,000 households to upgrade their old  boiler to the latest efficient models and to provide extra resources to tackle  fuel poverty.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The boiler scrappage scheme in England is not means-tested, but it  is based on the efficiency of the boiler. The scheme promotes fuel efficiency  and seeks to reduce the loss of heat and carbon emissions. The scheme offers  receipts of &pound;400 off the price of a new boiler that meets those efficiency  targets. We must tackle fuel poverty, and I am concerned that the warm homes scheme  is missing out on many people who experience fuel poverty but are excluded  because of the criteria. If this year&rsquo;s winter were to be repeated next year  and the year after, people will be under extreme financial strain in a  recession, especially as oil and gas prices continue to rocket. People are  under considerable financial strain already because of an increase in food,  travel and heating costs. The price of oil has almost doubled in two or three  years, and people are struggling. That is why it is important that we assist  people to reduce their heating bills and enhance heating efficiency. A boiler  scrappage scheme can help people to achieve that. Therefore, I welcome the  debate, and I commend the motion to the House.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  support the motion, although I am slightly surprised by where it has come from.  I will come back to that point later.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The English scheme offers &pound;400 a household to 125,000  households at a total cost of &pound;50 million. It is not designed as a fuel poverty  measure; it is, essentially, a measure to reduce carbon emissions. It seeks to  encourage the installation of fuel-efficient boilers. If it were introduced  here, it would advantage and make more fuel-efficient homes that directly avail  themselves of the scheme, and it would create a momentum of its own in that  other households that did not receive the voucher subsidy would be more  inclined to replace their boiler.<span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">8.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Its second policy objective is to support boiler  manufacturers, the industry and installers. Members might have received a  communication today from the Scottish and Northern Ireland Plumbing Employers&rsquo;  Federation in which it argued for a replication of the English scheme. The car  scrappage scheme was designed for exactly that purpose, and it was very  successful in stimulating that industry. Northern Ireland has a substantial  boiler construction industry as well as an installation industry.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We should note that in the pre-Budget report, the boiler  scrappage measure ran alongside improved fuel poverty measures that cost &pound;150  million. The total package was, therefore, &pound;200 million. However, as I say, the  boiler scrappage scheme was not a fuel poverty measure. An equivalent Northern Ireland  scheme would affect around 4,000 houses, perhaps a little more. At a cost of  &pound;400 a house, the total cost of the scheme would be &pound;1&middot;6 million. We received a  Barnett consequential of &pound;0&middot;7 million. The English scheme was not totally  funded with new money, and the Barnett consequential would not fully fund an  equivalent scheme here. However, we had an option of doing something with that  money in exactly the same terms as it was originally used for. It would have  been much more imaginative to have topped that money up with the modest sum  that was needed to replicate the English scheme.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">For that reason, I find the motion a little bit  disingenuous, particularly given my experience at the Finance Committee. When I  raised the issue at the Committee, the strongest terms in which I could get it  to write to the Department were to say that the Committee agreed that it would  be content for the additional funding to be used to create a similar boiler  scrappage scheme for Northern    Ireland, which I count as a lukewarm  response. I would have welcomed a much stronger argument for the use of that  Barnett consequential when the opportunity arose at the Committee. Of course,  the Department replied to the Committee in the same terms that it replied to me  on a question for written answer:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;all the addition Barnett consequentials from the 2009  PBR are used to offset the spending pressures for 2010-11.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As we heard, a different approach was taken in Scotland. My  party has argued for measures to stimulate the economy at this time. The  Scottish Parliament is committing the Barnett consequentials, in full, to  support boiler scrappage. As far as I can see, that scheme is like the English  one in that it is not merely a fuel poverty measure. However, a boiler  scrappage scheme that is based on fuel poverty has been created in Wales. That  scheme costs &pound;2&middot;5 million and will benefit up to 5,000 households. We must  recognise what the Department for Social Development (DSD) can and cannot do. I  assume that, legally and according to its terms of reference, it can create  only a fuel poverty targeted boiler scrappage scheme that is needs-based. DSD  cannot create a general carbon reduction scheme. That can only be done through  a different Department, probably the Department of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion, but a better outcome could have been  achieved. If DSD can do this within its own resources, and if it deems that to  be a good use of the funds available for fuel poverty, I will be pleased to see  that. However, we could have had both. We could have ensured that we used the  Barnett consequential for the purpose from which it was derived and created a  scheme that would have led to significantly more carbon reduction and  stimulated the industry. I regret that we did not do that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Browne</strong>:  Like most Members, I support the introduction of a boiler scrappage scheme in Northern Ireland.  The scheme currently operating in England has received a good response from the  public, and many people, particularly pensioners on fixed incomes, have  received the benefit of a new heating system at much more affordable prices.  Other Members have already outlined the advantage that such a scheme brings by  stimulating the economy and reducing the environmental impact of heating homes.  However, I believe that the real success of such a scrappage scheme would lie  in the improvements that it would bring to the quality of life for Northern Ireland  pensioners in particular, because they live on a fixed income and have been hit  particularly hard by the increase in fuel prices over the past number of years.  Although winter fuel payments have helped them, much of the additional money  has been eaten up by inefficient boilers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Indeed, as we heard, the Energy Saving Trust estimates that  simply replacing an old boiler with a new energy-efficient one could result in  savings of more than &pound;200 a year on heating bills. That is a truly monumental  figure, considering that many of our pensioners have very old and inefficient  boilers. Any move to make new energy-efficient boilers more affordable to  people on fixed incomes is to be welcomed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, I have one slight reservation about the scheme. In  recent years, the growing trend has been for people to purchase gas boilers for  home heating rather than oil boilers. That is understandable, because gas  heating and hot water systems tend to cost less to run than traditional oil or  electric hot water systems. Therefore, to be capable of providing a boiler  scrappage scheme, we must be sure that Northern Ireland has enough fitters  with the necessary qualifications to fit gas-powered boilers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Members are aware, from 1 April 2010 all gas appliance  fitters must be on the Gas Safe register to be legally allowed to fit gas  appliances. I recently checked the register and found that only four Northern Ireland  firms are listed, and, therefore, able to install home heating systems. That  figure is certainly not adequate to meet the demands that will come from  homeowners wanting to take advantage of a boiler scrappage scheme. That concern  should be addressed before a scrappage scheme is introduced.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The local contractor deficit is particularly pressing,  considering that &lsquo;The Sunday Times&rsquo; recently revealed that the larger gas  companies in England are raising the price of new gas boilers in order to  profit from the scheme rather than allowing customers to make savings. Members  will also be aware of the problems experienced in England over the maintenance of  boilers that were installed under the scheme. The problem was due mainly to  installers being so busy putting in new boilers that they did not have the  manpower available simultaneously to perform maintenance on boilers that they  had previously fitted. That led to considerable problems. The number of local  Gas Safe-registered fitters is a salient issue to be addressed if we are to  avoid the problems experienced in England and deliver a scheme that  would be to the overwhelming benefit of people here.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am confident that, with good planning, those problems can  be overcome. Therefore, I very much welcome the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  I am glad to be able to contribute to the debate, as many of the complaints  that I received in my constituency office this winter concerned the exclusion  of boiler replacement from the warm homes scheme. The main questions asked were  why some people got new boilers last year and others did not, and why people in  England, Scotland and Wales  got boiler scrappage schemes but people in Northern Ireland did not.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My colleagues who secured the debate referred to the  scheme&rsquo;s potential to help the economy, and I concur with their remarks. At a  time when the building trade is suffering from lack of work, the extension of  the boiler scrappage scheme would provide work for plumbers, electricians and  builders, and be an economic boost for the sector. However, the main reason for  having such a scheme is to ensure that people can live in warm, cost-efficient  homes. Older boilers use more fuel to heat the home and to heat water, and  those boilers hit people where it hurts: in their pockets. A new boiler largely  cures those problems and saves people money. Obviously, the introduction of a  boiler scrappage scheme would be an ideal way to ensure that more people are  removed from fuel poverty, which, rightly, is an extremely important factor for  the Assembly. However, at present, the warm homes scheme is very limited in  what it can do. The scope is there for an extended programme to be introduced,  and I ask the Minister to examine ways in which to do that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Ironically, although a boiler scrappage scheme would lead  to warmer homes, the more efficient new installations would have the knock-on  effect of reducing greenhouse gases and global warming. At the scheme&rsquo;s launch  in England,  Labour&rsquo;s Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, Ed Miliband, said:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Boiler Scrappage Scheme will save around &pound;200 off  heating bills per year for families that are replacing their old boilers, and  in total will save the same amount of carbon equivalent to taking around 45,000  cars off the road.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Minister, I foresee a three-way benefit from a boiler  scrappage scheme for Northern Ireland: warmer homes for more people at less  cost and reduced levels of fuel poverty; employment created in the construction  industry at a time of recession; and a small step towards lowering carbon  emissions and aiding the fight against climate change.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion is carefully worded, and states:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;to examine the scope for the future introduction of  a&hellip;scheme in Northern Ireland.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I urge the Minister to examine that scope and,  hopefully, we will see a scheme introduced in Northern   Ireland equivalent to those in England,  Scotland and Wales. I  support the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development (Ms Ritchie)</strong>: I thank the Chairperson of the Social  Development Committee for tabling the motion, which examines the introduction  of a boiler scrappage scheme. I also thank all of the Members who have  contributed to the debate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion calls on me, as Minister for Social Development,  to examine the scope for the introduction of a boiler scrappage scheme in Northern Ireland similar to those that have been  introduced in England, Scotland and Wales. The debate gives me the  opportunity to clarify some of the issues that have been raised. I will try to  deal with all of the concerns that Members have raised, and I assure Members  that I will read the Hansard report of the debate and if I have left any  question unanswered I will write directly to the Member concerned.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I feel the sense of urgency in the House regarding the  boiler scrappage scheme very clearly, and I am aware that that was the import  of the tabled amendment, which was withdrawn by Billy Armstrong of the Ulster  Unionist Party.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In his pre-Budget report, the Chancellor announced that a boiler  scrappage scheme was to be introduced in England. The aim of the scheme is  to reduce carbon emissions by offering a financial incentive to householders to  replace their inefficient boilers, and &pound;400 has been made available for up to  125,000 privately owned or rented households across England on a first-come,  first-serve basis. The installation of a new boiler could cost householders in  the region of &pound;2,000 to &pound;3,000. The Welsh and Scottish Governments have also  announced similar boiler scrappage schemes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The introduction of the boiler scrappage scheme in England has  generated considerable interest from MLA colleagues and the wider public, and  my officials have briefed the Social Development Committee on the matter.  Therefore, the debate also gives me the opportunity to clarify some issues  surrounding the scheme. I emphasise that the English scheme is aimed at  reducing carbon emissions primarily and is not targeted at vulnerable groups or  fuel-poor households. A scheme to mirror the English scheme would involve a  much greater investment, and, as it would be cross-departmental in nature, it  would likely require Executive consideration and would not be solely for my  Department to deliver or take the lead on. The Department of the Environment  has responsibility for climate change, and I would want my officials to discuss  any potential boiler scrappage scheme with officials from that Department.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although I support a local boiler scrappage scheme similar  to the English model, my first concern, as Minister with responsibility for the  fuel poverty strategy, is the alleviation of fuel poverty in vulnerable  households. As all Members are aware, and has already been said during the  debate, the definition of fuel poverty is when the cost of heating a home  requires more than 10% of the household income, and there are various  determinants in that, including low incomes, high fuel prices and energy  efficiency measures. None of us in Government have any control over incomes or  energy prices, but we do have control over energy efficiency measures.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">8.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I accept that improving the energy efficiency of  households that have old or inefficient boilers will contribute to the  alleviation of fuel poverty. That is why I asked my officials to include  proposals for a boiler replacement scheme in the new fuel poverty strategy that  will be available for public consultation in the spring. However, any such  scheme that I introduce will target vulnerable households in which people live  in fuel poverty; it will not focus solely on reducing carbon emissions, as is  the case with the scheme in England.  The reduction of carbon emissions is a welcome by-product of all the energy  efficiency schemes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A boiler replacement scheme should not be delivered on a  first-come, first-served basis. Given the limited availability of resources in  the current economic climate, I must ensure that resources are specifically  targeted at those who are most in need. I have reservations about introducing a  scheme that would require those on the lowest income to provide an additional  &pound;1,000, at the very least, towards the cost of installing a new and efficient  boiler. The boiler replacement scheme that I will propose as part of the new  fuel poverty strategy will not require households to make a financial  contribution. I will take on board the comments made during the public  consultation process in the spring.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members expressed concern about the removal of repairs  and upgrades of heating systems from the warm homes scheme, and they linked  that to a boiler scrappage scheme. The removal of repairs and upgrades enabled  DSD to open up the heating element of the warm homes scheme, for the first  time, to families who receive working tax credit. Research has shown that there  are long-term health benefits for children who live in a warm house. I should  point out that a boiler can still be replaced under the warm homes scheme in  the exceptional circumstances of there being a significant danger to the health  and safety of the occupants. As the administrators of the contract, that  decision is at the discretion of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. I hope  that I have provided some reassurance to Members who expressed concern about  that issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Heating systems are one element of improving the energy  efficiency of homes, but I want to highlight the importance of improving the  insulation of our housing stock. Insulation plays a key role in improving the  energy efficiency of homes. According to the Energy Saving Trust, about half  the heat lost in a typical home is through the walls and loft. The warm homes  scheme offers insulation to people on disability benefits and to those on  income-related benefits. Given the current cold weather, there is no better  time to make homes more energy-efficient by installing or improving insulation.  I ask Members to encourage their constituents to apply to the warm homes scheme  for assistance with insulation. They will feel the benefit of doing so through  the increased warmth of their homes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, tackling fuel poverty is a cross-departmental  issue that no Department can tackle on its own. All Departments have a role to  play in alleviating fuel poverty, as will be emphasised in the proposals in the  draft strategy. After public consultation, a strategy will be submitted to the  Executive for their approval. I hope that my Executive colleagues will support  the new strategy and ensure that all Departments play their part in the  alleviation of fuel poverty.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will touch on some of the issues that were raised during  the debate. Some Members spoke about their abiding interest in, and repeated  request for, the introduction of such a scheme, and I found that compelling.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Simon Hamilton raised the issue of the working fuel poor. I  have extended the criteria of the warm homes scheme to capture those families  who have young children and who are in receipt of working family tax credit.  They are now eligible to apply for assistance.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Anna Lo referred to the Housing Executive tenants who live  in homes with inefficient heating systems. The Housing Executive operates a rolling  programme to replace old and inefficient heating systems. The warm homes scheme  is different in that it targets owner occupiers and privately rented homes with  inefficient heating.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My colleague Declan O&rsquo;Loan made an interesting point about  Barnett consequentials, and he was right: a Barnett consequential of &pound;700,000  was received for boiler scrappage by the Department of Finance and Personnel,  but all the additional Barnett consequentials from the 2009 PBR are being used  to offset the spending pressures for 2010-11. Apart from Mr O&rsquo;Loan, nobody  referred to that issue, but it is interesting and worth amplifying. It is a  matter of regret that that issue was not addressed by the Department of Finance  and Personnel, and I would be happy to raise it again.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Alex Easton mentioned the criteria for the warm homes  scheme being too narrow. The warm homes scheme has assisted more than 80,000  households in Northern    Ireland with a range of heating and  insulation measures. The scheme was amended following a Northern Ireland Audit  Office report, because we needed to address need, disadvantage and poverty. I  have given a commitment to review the scheme once it has been in operation for  one year. To review it any earlier would not give us the evidence base and the  research base that we require.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank all Members for their contributions. I take on  board the import and purpose of the amendment, and I want that to be conveyed  to Ulster Unionist Party Members. I am charged with dealing with boiler  scrappage, but it must be done on the basis of need. We must target the  vulnerable and the disadvantaged so that we get to the people who need the  facility the most.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I reaffirm my total commitment to the alleviation of fuel  poverty and look forward to Members&rsquo; support for our new fuel poverty strategy,  which will include proposals for a boiler replacement scheme.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>: I  declare an interest. I was interested in boiler scrappage a long time before I  was elected to the House. Purely because of some of the Ballymena blood in me,  I wanted to reduce my home fuel bills. A number of years ago, I made the  decision to replace the boiler in my house with a new super-efficient model.  The effect of that was to increase the efficiency of my boiler from 60% to 97%,  which is an efficiency improvement of more than 50%.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members mentioned gas, but I do not have the luxury of  getting gas where I live. Although there has been an increase of more than 50%  in fuel prices over the past two or three years, the net effect of replacing my  boiler has been that I am still paying the same fuel bills that I was paying  five years ago. Such an effect would go a long way to tackling the fuel poverty  that is felt by vulnerable individuals.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I had the luxury of being able to fund the replacement of  my boiler myself, but not all people have that luxury. For that reason alone,  it is only right that we support the motion and try to get something done as  quickly as possible. I commend the Ulster Unionists for dropping the amendment,  because we cannot just jump straight into a scrappage scheme. Members  highlighted the difficulties that some of the schemes in England are  experiencing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairperson of the Committee, Simon Hamilton, talked  about the effect that those schemes are having on more than 40,000 homes in England, how  they will improve the system and how, as the Minister highlighted, their main  remit is to target carbon reduction. It is good that targeting carbon reduction  can have the wonderful side effect of targeting the fuel poor; I welcome that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McCann said that companies had abused the English  scheme. Some emails that I have received have hinted at the inflated prices  that people faced when taking up the &pound;400 grant, and I know that the Minister  will take that matter on board. We will not repeat that mistake in Northern Ireland;  we are more canny than that. Thomas Burns rightly pointed out that another  benefit of the scheme is the huge cash injection that it would give to local  industry. We have all received emails from boiler installation companies and their  representative bodies. Most companies in that industry are very small, perhaps  comprising only two or three people, and such a scheme would have a huge  benefit for locally based industry. David Hilditch hinted at those benefits.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Anna Lo queried whether the Housing Executive could be  included in the scheme, and the Minister answered that question. Alex Easton  said that heating bills in Northern Ireland  are one third higher than those in the rest of the UK. That adds to the great  difficulty that Northern Ireland  faces, with the hugely inflated fuel prices in the world market at present.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Simon Hamilton mentioned hard-to-reach areas. One thread that has run through  many of the Committee&rsquo;s discussions is the serious problem of fuel poverty in  rural constituencies, where people may have obsolete boilers or terrible  heating systems. I hope that the Minister takes that on board. Does the Member  agree that we should put a special focus on rural areas to try to ensure that  people receive the assistance that is required to change their boilers?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>: I  thank the Member for his intervention, and I hope that the Minister takes that  point on board. I was about to raise it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  I read your notes earlier.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>: I  will not comment on that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is a recognised fact that people who choose to live in  rural areas, such as I do, do not have access to gas or other forms of heating.  Therefore, we are stuck with the choice of oil, electricity or solid-fuel  heating, and those heating systems have inbuilt additional costs. Another issue  is that, because the population of rural areas tends to include more elderly  people, many heating systems in rural areas are much older than those in urban  areas. Therefore, I plead with the Minister to consider that issue and address  it in some of her proposals.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Lord Browne raised a most interesting point; he said that  there may not be enough fitters to carry out a scheme, even in the urban areas  of Northern Ireland  where gas is more prevalent. That is slightly concerning. I have no idea why  the standards were changed, but I know that the original gas-fitting scheme  created huge difficulties for gas fitters. Therefore, I hope that that  situation is not replicated. We need to keep a watching brief on that, because  it could lead to huge difficulties in the gas boiler industry in Northern  Ireland and could even have implications for the maintenance of existing  boilers, not only in the private sector but in the public sector, because much  of the Housing Executive stock has converted to gas.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">8.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I noted with interest what the Minister had to say about  the introduction of her proposed new fuel poverty scheme. I welcome that new  scheme and the fact that it will be targeted at those who are most in need. No  one will disagree with her about that, but I hope that any new scheme will also  have an impact on those who fall just outside the criteria for receipt of  benefits. Like most Members, I know that there are people who, because they  have a relatively small pension income or choose to work in low-paid jobs  rather than sit at home and take benefits, fall outside the benefits system and  receive no support whatsoever from the Government. Can those people be targeted  and helped? They have less money in their pockets than some people who are on  benefits. The House has failed to address that issue sufficiently.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also listened with interest to what the Minister had to  say about some households not having to make any contribution whatsoever  towards a new boiler. Although, in some circumstances, that is to be welcomed,  I just hope that the gesture is not abused. I know that the Minister will put  fail-safes into any such scheme to ensure that that will not be the case.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is interesting, for a change, that my party, more than  others, is supporting green issues in the House, and we look forward to the  fuel-efficient benefits of the proposed scheme. More importantly, however, we  look forward to tackling the issue of fuel poverty by yet another means in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That this Assembly notes the introduction of a boiler  scrappage scheme by HM Government and calls on the Minister for Social  Development to examine the scope for the future introduction of a similar  scheme in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Adjourned at 8.32 pm.</p>
