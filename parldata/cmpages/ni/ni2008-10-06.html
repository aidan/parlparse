		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The Assembly met at 12.00 noon (Mr Speaker in the  Chair).</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
		    <p class="H3SectionHeading">Assembly Business</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister (Mr P Robinson)</strong>: On a point of order, Mr Speaker. I know that you  are careful not to set precedents, even for points of order. However, on behalf  of the Executive and the Assembly, I express my sincere sympathy and  condolences to the deputy First Minister on the death of his mother earlier  this morning. Anybody who has spoken to the deputy First Minister over the past  weeks and months about his mother&rsquo;s illness will know just how close they were.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The passing of a mother is a difficult time for anyone;  many of us have already passed through that shadow. Although politics may be considered  a rough trade, all Members know that we must set aside any political issues and  recognise the difficulties that the family are facing at this time. This is a  time of deep mourning for the family. They will have many happy memories;  however, they are passing through a time of great difficulty.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On behalf of my party, as well as the Executive and the  Assembly, I express my sympathy to the whole family circle to make it clear  that we will remember them in our thoughts and our prayers.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Kelly</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Further to that point of order, Mr  Speaker, I thank the First Minister for his comments, and I join him in  expressing sympathy to the deputy First Minister on the loss of his mother,  Peggy McGuinness, whom I knew personally. She will be sadly missed in the Derry area and, indeed, further afield. She was a very  well-known and respected woman. Her sense of humour, as well as her political  prowess for a woman in her eighties, will be very much missed. On behalf of my  party, I express my condolences to the wider family circle. Go raibh maith  agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  Further to the First Minister&rsquo;s point of order, I express sympathy to the  deputy First Minister on behalf of the SDLP. To lose one&rsquo;s mother is a great  blow to anyone, at any age, and it is deeply regrettable.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I join with others in extending sympathy on behalf of the Ulster Unionist Party  to the McGuinness family on the death of their mother. We are not made of  stone, and we realise that the passing of one of the main figures in any family  will cause obvious distress. We extend our thoughts and prayers to the deputy  First Minister and his family at this time.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: I  add the condolences of the Alliance Party to those already expressed in the  Chamber. We send our thoughts and prayers to the McGuinness family at this  time. We were aware that Martin&rsquo;s mother had been ill, and that it has been a  difficult period for him, both politically and personally. We recognise that  and want to extend our sympathy to him and to the wider family circle.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  We all sympathise with the McGuinness family at this time.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Before we proceed this morning, I wish to comment on  remarks that were made during the sitting of the Assembly on Tuesday 30  September 2008. On studying the Official Report of proceedings, I noted with  concern comments made in relation to Mr Alex Maskey by the Minister for Social  Development, when she was responding to the debate on a private Member&rsquo;s  motion. My concerns about the Minister&rsquo;s comments were shared by other Members  who approached me during the hours and days following the debate.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My concerns arose from two issues. First, although there  were no unparliamentarily expressions used, the remarks did not, in my view,  come up to the standards of good temper and moderation that should be expected  from debates in this House. Secondly, and perhaps to compound the issue, the  remarks in question bore no relevance whatsoever to either the subject of the  motion being debated or to comments made by any Member during the debate. For  both those reasons, I find the Minister&rsquo;s remarks to have fallen short of the  requirements of Standing Orders and the standards of the House.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The point of order made by Mr A Maskey provided him with an  adequate opportunity to reply to the comments, and I encourage the Minister to  reflect on the reply and on my comments this morning. I remind Members that  these standards of which I have spoken &mdash; good temper and moderation in debate &mdash;  apply to all.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. Will you explain why you have not referred to  good temper and moderation in other cases? There have been numerous examples of  bad temper and lack of moderation in many speeches up until this point. Why are  you making this ruling on this particular incident?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  On at least four occasions in the House, I have spoken to Members and Ministers  about going outside the debate, whatever the subject. Secondly, on a number of  occasions, I have encouraged Members to be of good temperament and to show  moderation when they are speaking in the House. This is not the first occasion;  and anyone who reads the Hansard report will see that it clearly shows that the  Minister went totally outside the subject of the debate on three occasions.</p>
		    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="1"></a>Executive Committee Business</p>
		    <p class="H4StageHeading">Draft Fixed-Term Employees (Prevention of Less  Favourable Treatment) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations (Northern Ireland)  2008</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning (Sir Reg Empey)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">That the draft Fixed-Term Employees (Prevention of Less  Favourable Treatment) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations (Northern Ireland)  2008 be approved.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The draft regulations are subject to the affirmative  procedure as laid down in the parent legislation, the Employment Act 2002. The  regulations were laid in draft on 19 August 2008 and, subject to the approval  of the Assembly, it is intended that they will come into operation on 22  October 2008 in line with amendments to the equivalent legislation in Great Britain.  The regulations will amend the Fixed-Term Employees (Prevention of Less  Favourable Treatment) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2002. The 2002  regulations implement a European directive, which sought to give fixed-term  employees the right, in principle, not to be treated less favourably than  permanent employees of the same employer doing comparable work, including in  relation to statutory sick pay (SSP).</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Employers have a statutory liability to pay SSP for up to  28 weeks to any employee who is incapable of work for four or more consecutive  days and who satisfies the qualifying conditions. Prior to the introduction of  the 2002 regulations, SSP was not payable where contracts of service were for  three months or fewer. The 2002 regulations removed that exclusion. However,  when considering the GB version of those 2002 regulations, the English Court of  Appeal ruled that the removal of that exclusion did not apply to temporary  agency workers. That decision clarified the law: agency workers in GB, and,  therefore, in Northern    Ireland, with contracts of three months or  fewer, are not entitled to SSP. That is against the policy intention of the  2002 regulations.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Members will be aware that the principle of the statutory  payments legislation is to treat all workers who are liable to pay National  Insurance contributions on their income in the same way, regardless of their  length of contract. That court ruling means that agency workers with contracts  of three months or fewer are the only group of workers excluded from  entitlement to statutory sick pay, despite their qualifying for other statutory  payments such as statutory maternity, paternity and adoption pay. These  amending regulations, which are minor and technical in nature, correct that  anomaly and restore the initial policy intention of offering further protection  to agency workers on short contracts.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am grateful to the Committee for Employment and Learning  and the Examiner of Statutory Rules for their detailed scrutiny of the policy  proposals and the draft regulations. At its meeting on 17 September, the  Committee recommended that the draft regulations be approved by the Assembly.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Employment and Learning (Ms S Ramsey)</strong>: Go raibh maith  agat, a Cheann Comhairle. As Chairperson of the Employment and Learning  Committee, I support the motion. The regulations have been laid in draft and  are subject to affirmative resolution. On 2 July, the Committee first examined  the Department&rsquo;s proposal with regard to these regulations, and on 17  September, it examined the proposed statutory rule. On both occasions, the  Committee was content with the policy proposal.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has explained the purpose of the rule and the  technicalities involved. The rule will allow agency workers the same rights as  their permanent colleagues, and that is to be welcomed. It is a significant  step forward in the recognition of all workers as being equal. It is a major  boost for the high proportion of women who undertake agency work to allow them  greater flexibility to manage homes, families, and their many other commitments.  No longer will such workers be treated and regarded as second class.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">With that in mind, I am pleased to give the Committee&rsquo;s  support to this motion.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Newton</strong>: I  welcome the motion. As the Chairperson of the Committee for Employment and Learning  said, there was considerable debate in the Committee on the matter, which will  bring into full rights many who were excluded. There has been a tendency in  recent years to use agency workers &mdash; I do not want to use the term &ldquo;abuse&rdquo; &mdash; in  the knowledge that there were rights from which they were excluded. Therefore,  I welcome the amended regulations.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I am grateful to those Members who contributed.  Although the provisions of the regulations are, as I said, minor and technical  in nature, and are required in order to restore the original intention of the  2002 regulations, they will benefit many agency workers.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The House has, on several occasions over the past 12  months, I believe, debated issues pertaining to agency workers, to their rights  and to people with unscrupulous employers who might abuse those rights. This  amendment closes one loophole, and I welcome the support of the Committee and  those Members who contributed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">That the draft Fixed-Term Employees (Prevention of Less  Favourable Treatment) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations (Northern Ireland)  2008 be approved.</p>
		    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="2"></a>Committee Business</p>
		    <p class="H4StageHeading">Diseases of Animals Bill</p>
		    <p class="H4StageHeading">Extension of Committee Stage</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development (Dr W McCrea)</strong>: I beg  to move</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">That, in accordance with Standing Order 33(4), the period  referred to in Standing Order 33(2) be extended to 17 February 2009, in  relation to the Committee Stage of the Diseases of Animals Bill (NIA Bill  22/07).</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I seek the approval of the House to extend the Committee  Stage of the Bill to what might seem to be a very generous deadline, especially  as the Department&rsquo;s consultation process resulted in only five responses.  However, the Committee gave the matter consideration and considerable thought  before arriving at the date of 17 February 2009, which, we believe, represents  a realistic target.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Obviously, if the Committee can complete its formal  scrutiny of the proposed Bill any sooner, it most certainly will. The Committee  office and officials from the Department have met in order to discuss the  logistics of progressing the Bill, and that contact will continue throughout  the process. As the Committee is not in a position to return to the House to  ask for a second extension, it is essential that we get the Bill right in the  first instance, and I believe that we are doing so.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The current legislation, the Diseases of Animals (Northern Ireland) Order  1981, is more than 25 years old. When the Second Stage of the Diseases of  Animals Bill was introduced on 15 September 2008, I spoke of the risks posed to  the industry and the Northern    Ireland economy by continual threats from  established diseases, such as TB and brucellosis, and new diseases, such as  bluetongue.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Since the 1981 Order, we have seen the devastation that was  caused by BSE and foot-and-mouth disease. The proposed Bill recognises  correctly the threats of those and other animal diseases and the valuable  lessons to be learned from the way in which the Government, the Department and  the industry reacted to those threats.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is imperative that those lessons are included in the  legislation, and the Committee intends to take extensive evidence from the  Department and the industry to ensure that the Bill affords the utmost  protection to the Northern    Ireland economy. In introducing the Bill,  the Minister acknowledged that the Committee had received three presentations  on it. That is a mark of how important the Bill is and why the Committee must  take an appropriate period to scrutinise it.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">During the debate on the Second Stage of the Bill, several  Members referred to the Ruddock Report. That report was published as a result  of an inquiry into the Department&rsquo;s handling of the alpha-nortestosterone  debacle, and it particularly considered the Department&rsquo;s power of entry.  Lessons have also been learned from that event, and those lessons do not  necessarily afford protection to the industry per se. Rather, they offer  protection to the people who work in the industry. It is also imperative that  appropriate consideration be taken to ensure that the Bill provides that  protection.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have outlined several logistical considerations to a Bill  at Committee Stage. As the Department must do, the Committee must consult on  the matter, and the public notice for that consultation was placed the day  after the Bill passed to the Committee. Unlike the Department, the Committee  must consider any written responses, decide on which witnesses to call for  evidence, take that evidence and examine the Bill on a clause-by-clause bases  before producing a draft report, which the Committee intends to issue to the  Department for consideration. Following that, the report must be printed, laid  in the Business Office and considered by the House.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Given the importance of the Bill, the Committee is of the  view that that cannot be done within the period that is defined by Standing  Order 33(2), particularly as the Assembly will be in recess for part of that  period. The period to which we seek to extend also includes the Christmas  recess, but it is a realistic period, given the depths of consideration that  are required.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee takes the matter of protecting against animal  diseases seriously, and it is certainly not our intention to delay the Bill any  longer than the 18 months that it has taken the Department to bring it to the  House. It is an extremely important piece of legislation, and the Department  was right to take that time to ensure that it had, in its mind, got it right.  Equally, it is important that the Committee is not rushed in its deliberations  of the Bill and that it is afforded the opportunity to hear from the Department  and the industry so that it can consider the impact of each and every clause on  the industry and the wider Northern    Ireland economy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that the Committee will, in conjunction with the  Department, get the opportunity to get it right. We cannot afford any other  result.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">That, in accordance with Standing Order 33(4), the period  referred to in Standing Order 33(2) be extended to 17 February 2009, in  relation to the Committee Stage of the Diseases of Animals Bill (NIA Bill  22/07).</p>
		    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="3"></a>Private Members&rsquo; Business</p>
		    <p class="H4StageHeading">Strategy for Cohesion,&nbsp;  Sharing and Integration</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30 minutes for  the debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes in which to propose  and 10 minutes in which to make a winding-up speech. All other Members who are  called to speak will have five minutes.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">One amendment has been selected and published on the  Marshalled List. The proposer of the amendment will have 10 minutes in which to  propose and five minutes in which to make a winding- up speech.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>: I  beg to move</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly expresses its concern at the delayed  publication of a strategy for Cohesion, Sharing and Integration; calls on the  First Minister and deputy First Minister to publish their strategy without  further delay and to detail how this strategy will promote reconciliation, the  ideal of a truly shared future and how it will help the Executive&rsquo;s commitment  to eradicate poverty.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I apologise on behalf of my co-proposer Dolores Kelly for  her inability to be present today due to a long-standing family commitment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP accepts the Alliance Party&rsquo;s amendment, but with  some reservation, because it calls for the production of:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;an action plan, led by the Office of the First  Minister and deputy First Minister, to tackle segregation in schools, housing  and leisure facilities.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The nub of the motion is the SDLP&rsquo;s frustration at the  incompetence and fumbling by the Office of the First Minister and deputy First  Minister (OFMDFM) in relation to the publication of a strategy for cohesion,  sharing and integration. I hope that the Alliance Party will acknowledge that  the Minister for Social Development has made progress on housing, and I will  deal with that matter in more detail later.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Without desegregating housing, integrated education will  not work. Through their inability to publish the cohesion strategy, the  political masters at OFMDFM have failed to display even minimal competence.  Time and time again, the Assembly has been fobbed off with a series of evasive  and waffly answers from OFMDFM. Over a period of six months, in answer to  Members&rsquo; questions about the cohesion strategy, there have been increasingly  incoherent answers on when that strategy will be published. On 1 April 2008,  April Fool&rsquo;s Day, OFMDFM stated:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;We are now at an advanced stage of development of the  detailed proposals&rdquo;.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On 22 May 2008, some seven weeks later, OFMDFM again  stated:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;We are now at an advanced stage of development of the  detailed proposals&rdquo;.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On 28 May 2008, in response to a further question OFMDFM  repeated the phrase:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;at an advanced stage&rdquo;.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, on that occasion the word &ldquo;strategy&rdquo; was  substituted by &ldquo;programme&rdquo;.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On 28 May 2008, in answer to a question from a Sinn F&eacute;in  Member, OFMDFM again promised that it was &ldquo;finalising detailed proposals&rdquo; and  was:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;committed to tackling racism, sectarianism, and  intolerance in any of their manifestations.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Members should note that the order of the words relegates  sectarianism to second place behind racism. Sectarianism, racism and  intolerance are inextricably linked; they are all facets of one prism. No one  abhors racism more than I, as a representative of South   Belfast, which is the most ethnically diverse constituency in the  North. However, sectarianism is the primary cause of division here. It is  hundreds of years old, whereas racism is a relatively recent offshoot and  manifestation of that original cancer.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On 10 June 2008, my colleague John Dallat asked for an  assurance that the amalgamation of the separate strategies into a single  cohesion strategy will not involve a reduction in the level of funding that is  available. OFMDFM gave an answer to a question about racial equality that had  not been asked. That seemed to be another diversionary tactic, an impression  that was reinforced in an answer to a question from a Sinn F&eacute;in Member.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On 10 June 2008, OFMDFM stated its:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;intention to publish the Programme of Cohesion,  Sharing and Integration as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">OFMDFM is, undoubtedly, playing the Assembly for a fool in  the matter of the strategy&rsquo;s publication. The DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in appear to be  conniving and employing diversionary tactics to shift the focus from their  obligation to produce a cohesive strategy towards a watered down programmatic  approach on sectarianism that has been further diluted to a racial equality  programme. I recognise that racism is a serious problem in society, but it  should not be cynically used and abused to divert attention from the core issue  of sectarianism.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The publication of the strategy has been caught up in the  perpetual rowing behind closed doors in OFMDFM. Much as the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in  may despise each other and fight like cats and dogs, they are united in their  lust for power, domination and division, and they are determined to hold on to  power. Given how the two parties act, it is perhaps naive to hope or expect  that they will do anything to dismantle sectarianism.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive have not met for more than three months, but  neither the First Minister nor the deputy First Minister has missed any photo  opportunities during that period. However, as far as the community is  concerned, it has been a case of all picture, no sound and certainly no  substance.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to end on a note of hope. One of the Executive&rsquo;s  successes has been Minister for Social Development Margaret Ritchie&rsquo;s  performance in office. She has used her ministerial powers to tackle the growing  housing crisis and effect positive social change in pursuit of reconciliation  and a truly shared future. Over the next three years, the Department for Social  Development (DSD) will develop at least 30 shared future housing neighbourhoods  in existing Northern Ireland Housing Executive estates. Those neighbourhoods  will allow existing tenants to live in an area where diversity is welcomed and  encouraged.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Radical social change is necessary in order to banish the  issues that divide us and enable us to work together to overcome global  challenges. We cannot expect to heal our divisions if we continue to reinforce  them by maintaining segregation. For too long, people have grown up, played and  lived in separate neighbourhoods, been taught in separate schools, followed  different sports and been slow to share the workplace &mdash; those are the most  regrettable legacies of the Troubles. That segregation fuelled the conflict,  and, because of that physical and mental entrenchment, communities grew further  apart. Furthermore, they were unwilling and unable to recognise that  segregation was the cause of their insecurity, not the solution to it.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A proactive, progressive public policy can help to achieve  reconciliation, and housing is the obvious starting point. Margaret Ritchie has  ensured that the concept of a shared future will be a central theme in all  housing policy development. We know that 80% of people, given the choice, want  to live in a mixed neighbourhood. I was fortunate enough to be brought up in a  small Housing Trust development in Warrenpoint, where people from all  backgrounds lived side by side peacefully. Both our neighbours were policemen,  and we were all good neighbours. Today, individuals who are waiting for shared  social housing have little or no choice in that regard and, usually, end up in  single-identity estates because there is no alternative. They must tolerate  flags and bunting outside their house regardless of their feelings on the  matter.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A considerable amount of community involvement is required  in those shared future developments to ensure that tenants are ready to commit  to sharing and to abandon the trappings of a single-identity enclave. It is not  sufficient to focus attention on new developments, because the majority of  social housing neighbourhoods remain single-identity estates. Five  neighbourhoods have already &mdash; with community support &mdash; signed up for the  programme, such as the Ballynafeigh neighbour&shy;hood in south Belfast.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A shared future means a better future; however, that is not  enough. A shared future in housing is, at present, only possible in areas that  already have some cross-community integration. Much more work is required to  counter the mentality that exists in staunch single-identity communities.  Moreover, our system of allocating houses according to objective need  reinforces the status quo. The existing housing segregation leads to segregated  waiting lists, and, therefore, in the majority of instances, housing will be  allocated to people from the same community background as the previous tenant.  That perpetuates the segregation.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Minister Ritchie announced her intention to regard shared  future housing as an entitlement for those who want it. It is a radical  proposition that replicates existing provision in the education sector. Many parents  choose integrated education because they want their children to be educated in  a mixed and shared environment. The state, rightly, strives to meet that  demand. Why does the housing sector not offer such provision? If parents want  to raise their children in a mixed and shared community, the state has a duty  to meet that demand.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: I  beg to move the following amendment: At end insert</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;; and calls on the Executive to meet immediately to commit  to producing an action plan, led by the Office of the First Minister and deputy  First Minister, to tackle segregation in schools, housing and leisure  facilities.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Members for proposing the motion and accepting  the amendment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Our amendment does not seek to change the thrust of the  motion. Instead, it presses the need for action as well as strategy.  Unfortunately, this devolved Administration has been rather poor at addressing  those issues. In fairness to the current First Minister and deputy First  Minister, it is not solely their problem, because very little progress was made  when previous Executives dealt with that aspect of policy. In fact, it is to  our shame that most progress in relation to a shared future and a racial  equality strategy was achieved during direct rule, when triennial action plans  were developed and annual action plans were formulated.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We need to get to grips with that, because it is probably  one of the biggest challenges that faces the Assembly. It is not an easy issue  to wrangle with, because it cuts to the very heart of the divisions in society.  It also cuts through almost every aspect of life. Many reports have cited the  extent to which sectarianism, division, racism, bigotry and hatred influence  people&rsquo;s choices about where to go to school or where to live; where they feel  safe going to work or to receive training; about their access to jobs and  services; or about all of those. It cuts right across the board, and it is  something that must be tackled if people are to be given the opportunity to  reach their full potential and to participate fully in their community.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">This matter will not be easy to address, but the fact that  it is difficult is not an excuse to delay the process. The divisions go to the  core of our community. Fear, prejudice, bigotry and a lack of trust hamper  political progress in the institutions, and hamper the ability of communities  to fulfil their potential. Furthermore, they hamper the ability of individuals  to make their own choices, free from any pressure.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am honest and open, and do not claim that the shared  future strategy and racial equality strategy are perfect documents. The  Alliance Party broadly welcomed them, as did the people who implemented and  delivered them. They were a good place to start. When the Executive and OFMDFM  announced at the start of this Assembly that they wanted to review the  strategy, the Alliance Party made it very clear that it was not averse to that,  and that is on record.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It appears that almost every direct rule document has to be  unpicked and rebuilt from scratch, and we expressed our concern about that. One  needs a wheel to get from A to B, but one does not need to reinvent it. Any  policy that has the thumbprint of the direct rule Administration on it tends to  be jettisoned, regardless of its worth. That must be overcome.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We recognised that the strategy would have much more power  in communities if the imprimatur of a locally devolved Administration supported  it. We had no difficulty with the current Administration, the Executive and  OFMDFM wishing to review it. We would have preferred to see aspects of the  strategy expanded to cover other groups that are not currently mentioned in the  racial equality or the shared future strategies. Although dealing with their  exclusion from society may be implicit in the strategy, it would be good if it  were explicit. From that perspective, we did not have particular difficulties  with the notion of a review.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We hope that, with the Executive and OFMDFM imiprimatur,  they will take ownership of the strategy and pursue it enthusiastically. That  is something that we would welcome. However, there has been little enthusiasm,  even to complete the review and submit a proposal to the Committee so that  progress can be made. The time taken on this process has been excessive. It  would be hard to say otherwise because &mdash; as Carmel Hanna rightly said &mdash; we have  been told that the strategy has been at an advanced stage of development since  the start of the year.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On several occasions, the Committee has been told that the  submission of the strategy is imminent, yet we still do not have the document.  The Committee was assured that its members would see it before the Halloween  recess, and I am sure that the Junior Minister will refer to that in his  response. I welcome that assurance, but I will believe it when I see it, because  we were also promised it before the summer recess. It was also hinted that we  might even have seen it before the Easter recess. We are, therefore, dealing  with a moveable feast. It concerns me that those deadlines are put back and  that we see no progress.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that the junior Minister will not be overly insulted  if I say that OFMDFM has become something of an abyss into which things  disappear. After entering that chasm, only the most dogged of documents escape  and see the light of day again.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A few weeks ago, one of my colleagues quipped that the  strategy &mdash; CSI &mdash; is well named because, at this point, we would need crime  scene investigators to locate it.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Progress must be made to produce something substantive,  which brings me to the amendment. Far from indicating that the Alliance Party  is dissatisfied with individual Ministers &mdash; which appears to be what Members  have taken from it &mdash; the amendment attempts to focus on the fact that the  policy is not just about strategic thinking at Executive level, or about  platitudes; it is about producing detailed action plans that can then be  supported on the ground, where they will make the most difference.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We have had to wait a long time for the strategy, and the  last time we had a shared future strategy, we had an equally long wait for the  resultant action plans. I am pressing for an action plan now because, given  that the Executive have had so long to work on the matter, I want them to  produce a strategy and an action plan, so that we can get started on making  changes.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The experience with the previous strategy was not that it  was wrong, but that its vision could have been expanded. For example, the  direct feedback on the racial equality strategy indicated that robust actions  were necessary. In some ways, reviewing and beefing up action plans &mdash; in  response to comments from those who were charged with delivering the shared  future strategy and the racial equality strategy &mdash; is more important than  rewriting the strategic document.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The amendment focuses on a couple of areas in which central  Government have a role, because the feedback that the Alliance Party has  received &mdash; whether through the Committee for the Office of the First Minister  and deputy First Minister or through questions in the House &mdash; indicates a focus  on the impact of local government and a bottom-up approach.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Given my position as chairperson of the good relations  partnership in Belfast City Council &mdash; so I declare that interest &mdash; I recognise  the important role that local government must play in connecting with the  public and in being able to facilitate local community groups progressing at  their own pace; however, there is a much wider aspect to segregation in our  society that requires the Assembly&rsquo;s support and action.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The shared future strategy will impact on employment  matters &mdash; the Minister for Employment and Learning spoke earlier &mdash; because  people&rsquo;s choices about where they work, live or access training are restricted  because of divisions in society. People have mind maps that delineate where  they feel safe to go, and unless we recognise and deal with such divisions when  producing policies in all areas of governance, we will not be able to offer  people the support that they require to make choices.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Shared housing has already been mentioned, and I do not  wish to criticise anything being done by the housing Minister to create more of  it, but we must recognise that, with regard to public housing, it is a drop in  the ocean. For example, we must consider the people who live outside such  designated developments, and the protection and support that they receive when  they are under pressure and facing difficulties from intimidation.  Unfortunately, the policy still appears to be to move those who are threatened  and intimidated, rather than those who threaten and intimidate. Therefore,  although shared-housing projects are useful as a template for the future, we  must consider other matters &mdash; such as the right to live in a single-identity  area &mdash; which do not just affect people who make the choices, but also everyone  around them. In essence, the first person of a different identity to move into  a single-identity area breaches someone else&rsquo;s express wish. So there are  issues that must be addressed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party wants the Executive&rsquo;s document to be  produced swiftly; a detailed action plan to be prepared and to go to public  consultation; and for Members to reach the point at which we were when elected,  when we were in the process of actually delivering a shared future, rather than  talking about it.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I support the motion and the amendment.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">12.45 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to clarify my party&rsquo;s position. When I first heard  that we were to debate CSI, I, too, thought that the motion was about &lsquo;CSI:  Crime Scene Investigation&rsquo;, which is one of my favourite television programmes.  However, as has been said, the motion is much more important than that &mdash; it is  about producing a strategy for our Province.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As a member of the Committee for the Office of the First  Minister and deputy First Minister, I am aware of how much hard work has been  done to produce the strategy. Undoubtedly, the strategy must be produced.  However, the strategy that is published must be the correct strategy, and that  is what we are trying to achieve. It must answer all the needs that pertain to  fairness and equality that exist in the Province, and, for that to be achieved,  a great deal of thought must be put into the proposals and recommendations that  are made.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I agree that it is vital to have a strategy in place and to  adhere to its recommendations. Although I would prefer it if the strategy were  being implemented already, it is most important that the right strategy be  released, so that it can play a part in changing the situation in Northern Ireland.  The strategy is important to all Committee members. It has not been forgotten  about or pushed aside in any shape or form. I am aware of my own drive and that  of the Committee to eradicate poverty. The implementation of the strategy is  one of the Committee&rsquo;s commitments and remains of the utmost importance.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am also aware that, with the so-called credit crunch  looming, it is even more vital that we propose and follow the correct approach,  in order to ensure that those who are already struggling to keep their heads  above water do not sink to the bottom as a result of the extra financial  burden. The concepts of a shared future and the eradication of poverty are  linked in the sense that we in Northern    Ireland are working together to cross all  the existing boundaries. We can achieve a great deal as a Province when we have  people from all ethnic groups, all religious persuasions and all political  backgrounds working together.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On Saturday morning, I hosted a coffee morning in  Newtownards town hall to raise money for the families of soldiers, sailors and  members of the Royal Air Force. I was heartened to receive donations, both big  and small, from all sectors of the Ards community. Ladies had baked big cakes  and small cakes for the occasion, and I even met a woman who came just to do  her bit in the kitchen. Those people came together as a result of a common  bond, which is that they have loved ones working in the armed forces.  Therefore, they wanted to do their bit to help. In those few hours, we were  able to raise more than &pound;1,000 to help those in need. I would love to see that  happen on a larger scale right across the Province; that is, people working  together to do good and to achieve a result. That can happen, and, for it to  happen, the strategy is integral.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I ask the First Minister and the deputy First Minister to  publish the strategy only after the Committee has considered it and made its  recommendations. That request is made in the knowledge that they are already  working hard on getting it right. I must make it clear to colleagues &mdash; because  it seems to be unclear at present &mdash; that the strategy is, and will remain, an  urgent matter; therefore, it will not be put on the back-burner. I have every  reason to expect that the strategy will be released as soon as it is ready and  correct.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is no doubt that some of the old division lines still  exist in the Province. Moreover, some new ones have developed &mdash; as the number  of migrant workers has increased, new prejudices have come to the fore.  However, it is also clear that much work is already being done in the Province  to combat growing prejudices. I congratulate those community leaders who have  worked so hard to ensure that all members of the community are included in  their schemes and who, in some places, have gone so far as to arrange cookery  lessons with the help of translators to enable migrant workers to cook  efficiently and economically.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Such work is happening already and is being sponsored  through different initiatives. Although more funding may become available when  the strategy is completed and the Committee has made its recommendations, I  want to make it clear that work is being done with communities to promote  cohesion, sharing and integration. Previously, the junior Ministers have  indicated that &pound;1 million is available to fund 23 different ethnic  organisations. That shows that work is being done at different levels.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The work that is being undertaken now does not rely  completely on OFMDFM&rsquo;s releasing a paper, although that will enhance that work.  I have every confidence that when the strategy is released &mdash; it is a matter of  urgency, so it will be published soon &mdash; it will complement what is already in  place. Members are aware of the &pound;21 million that OFMDFM has set aside for good  relations over the next three years. A further &pound;7&middot;5 million, again over the  next three years, has been allocated to improve relationships and to deal with  challenges. Again, that shows OFMDFM&rsquo;s commitment.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member&rsquo;s time is almost up.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  We must support the motion. We must also do our bit to contribute to the  strategy, and we must have faith in our community workers.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat. I echo the views of all Members in wanting to see the  publication of a cohesion, sharing and integration strategy as soon as  possible. Therefore, I was pleased when the First and deputy First Minister  confirmed to the OFMDFM Committee last week that that strategy would be with  the Committee before the Halloween recess. Nevertheless, I welcome the  opportunity to discuss the issue.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to have a strategy that promotes  substantive equality through the eradication of inequality and exclusion;  factors that have sustained racism and sectarianism. Only when that is  attained, will we have established the ground on which we can build a shared  and better future. I hope that the strategy will act as a road map towards the  building of the kind of shared and better future that we all want to see &mdash; one  that is based on solid building blocks that tackle exclusion and inequality.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The deputy First Minister has signalled a financial  investment of around &pound;29 million to roll out the programme. We have agreed the  building blocks of laws and practices that set the context for the resource  allocation for building a shared and better future. I look forward to hearing  the details of the proposals.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There can be no hierarchy of equality. Any good-relations  strategy that is based on having due regard to promote equality of opportunity  and does not include actions to address relationships between section 75  vulnerable groups in wider society is not only doomed to failure, but ignores  the legal and policy base that gives it legitimacy in the expenditure of public  resources.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The funding programme must enable excluded groups to  identify what we must do to change our behaviour and our implementation of  public policy. If that is not done, we are in danger of labelling them as  victims who need support rather than groups and people who need resources to  change the patterns and behaviours that have caused their exclusion.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am aware that some politicians would prefer some minority  groups to stay silent, or see a good psychiatrist. However, Sinn F&eacute;in is  determined to deliver genuine equality and good relations for all in this  society.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Recent unwise and unsafe commentary by some politicians &mdash;  one of whom may be forgiven because, as she has acknowledged, she is not the  brightest light in the candelabra &mdash; makes it all the more necessary for the  House to affirm that equality for all is at the heart of building a shared and  better future. I reassure all who experience disadvantage and exclusion that  that is Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s central position; a position that agrees with the Equality  Commission&rsquo;s guidelines, which state:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;social cohesion requires equality to be reinforced by  good community relations&rdquo;.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s view of a shared and better future is premised  on a belief that community relations that are built on inequality are community  relations that are built on sand. No matter how close the contact that  different groups may have, unless that contact is underpinned by equality, it  is absolutely meaningless.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Men and women share houses and have good relations.  However, that does not mean that gender inequality is not a crucial problem in  our society.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Social need is closely interrelated to cohesion, sharing  and integration. Both the St Andrews Agreement and the Programme for Government  set the context for tackling poverty through the criteria of objective need.  Therefore, I hope that Ministers such as Margaret Ritchie ensure that people in  north Belfast  are allocated houses based on their need. Currently, more than 80% of those on  housing waiting lists in north Belfast are of a Catholic and nationalist  background. However, their needs are being undermined by the pursuit of a  flawed, shared future agenda.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Hopefully, it is not the case that the proposers of the  motion want to talk about how much they want a shared and better future while  wishing to maintain the same structures, patterns and outcomes of deprivation  that make people&rsquo;s lives a misery. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I broadly support the motion and the amendment. This Assembly is founded on the  principle of a shared community.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Intrinsic to that concept, and its realisation, is the  recognition of our diversity and the determination to make mutual respect and  recognition the basis for a Northern    Ireland that is at ease with itself and that  is characterised by a more pluralist society.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Unionist Party accepts that existing patterns of  division are likely to remain for some time, and we have expressed our  misgivings about certain policy aspects of the &lsquo;A Shared Future&rsquo; document. Too  much of that document is intent on undermining &mdash; rather than on being more  positive towards &mdash; pluralism.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Building a shared community that best reflects the values  of the modern United Kingdom  is at the heart of my party&rsquo;s vision for Northern Ireland. That vision of a  shared community is an essential part of the entire political project that is  represented by the Assembly, and any foot dragging in that regard has the  potential to destabilise the institutions and their effective operation. The  strategy for cohesion, sharing and integration &mdash; and the delay in its  publication by the OFMDFM &mdash; therefore, matter.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Many people outside the Assembly have understandable fears  that OFMDFM is paying lip service to the concept of a shared future; they fear  that OFMDFM is talking the talk, but not walking the walk. Many suspect that  OFMDFM is locked in a bear hug of mutual veto and that that sterile situation  has led to the paralysis in Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s Government at the Executive level.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On 30 May of this year, the junior Ministers, Mr Donaldson  and Mr Kelly, emphasised the importance of working towards a society in which  there is respect for each other&rsquo;s traditions when they opened the conference,  &lsquo;Cohesion, Sharing and Integration &mdash; our role in a better future&rsquo;. On that  occasion, junior Minister Donaldson said:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;We have now entered a new and hopeful period in our  shared history. We have an unprecedented opportunity to build a shared and  better future for all.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, a mere four months later, the Executive is in cold  storage, having failed to meet since June. Where is the vision of 30 May? What  has happened to that unprecedented opportunity? Is a shared and better future  for all no longer a priority?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The danger that lies at the heart of a failure to work on  the basis of mutual respect, and to give proper weighting to cohesion and a  shared future, is that it helps to create a political vacuum, which nurtures  the attitudes that contributed to the painful, bitter experience of the  Troubles.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Society is observing the Executive&rsquo;s pathetic inability to  function in any meaningful manner. We must ask how, after the past three months  of inaction and paralysis afflicting OFMDFM, the First Minister and the deputy  First Minister can speak with authority on the issue of cohesion, sharing and  integration. That is why the Ulster Unionist Party will support the motion.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Cohesion, mutual respect and working together are not  optional add-ons to the institutions; they should be at the core of what we are  doing here and what we are trying to build. Action to provide for the most  vulnerable can be achieved only by strong legislation and leadership, which, in  turn, are dependent on a mutually agreed programme. Recently, the Executive  signed up to the UK-wide goal of eradicating child poverty by 2020. How can  that goal be delivered when the Executive cannot even meet? They cannot meet  even in the context of a global economic crisis.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The strength of the Assembly is based on mutual recognition  and on mutual respect, and we achieve that by recognising our diversity &mdash; not  by pretending that division does not exist. We cannot build cohesion, sharing  and integration through trite slogans or by denying social realities that have  emerged over generations.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member must draw his remarks to a close.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  The Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister has a profound  responsibility to end the present sterile stand-off.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">1.00 pm</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  The creation of a shared and better future for Northern Ireland is an important  point and clearly requires a strategy for cohesion, sharing and integration.  Equality, diversity and interdependence are important principles for the future  of Northern Ireland and this  part of the United Kingdom.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Carmel Hanna&rsquo;s speech sounded more like a party political  broadcast than a speech about cohesion, sharing and integration. It seems that  the only party doing anything in this regard &mdash; in her perspective &mdash; is the  SDLP. I suggest that that is rather wide of the mark, and that there are issues  that her party should examine.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">She talked about shared housing &mdash; and her colleague Alban  Maginness is here today. When the community that used to live in the Torrens  estate in north Belfast  were forced out of their homes by republican intimidation, Mr Maginness  subsequently said that that was fine, because the land could be used for  nationalists. He said that it was a windfall site. A windfall is where someone  receives good fortune unexpectedly. The description of what happened in the  Torrens area as a windfall &mdash; or good fortune &mdash; was a sad reflection on how  Alban views the housing situation in that part &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. First, I reject entirely what the Member has  said. Secondly, I remind him that the decline of the Torrens  estate was due to several factors. Certainly, there was some intimidation.  However, the people who left the Torrens  estate did so in an organised fashion and to an agreed programme, and were  rehoused immediately. The Torrens area was a  windfall site in the context of providing additional housing, as it had become  a sink estate. There was an opportunity for it to be rehabilitated and rebuilt.  That was done and, therefore, it was a windfall site for housing in north Belfast.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  In relation to the point of order, perhaps the Member was interpreting what the  Member had said. However, he may wish to clarify his position.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  I am grateful to Mr Maginness for confirming that he described that site as a  windfall. It was a shameful and sectarian viewpoint, and it is still the same  today.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As regards shared housing, when plans were put forward for  the Summervale site in north Belfast,  another member of the SDLP Alex Attwood opposed progress on that site and  demanded that a very high wall be built around it so that there would be a  clear division between it and the neighbouring Mountainview estate. It is  interesting to see that there are issues not just for one or two parties, but  for all political parties, including the SDLP.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is not just an issue of shared housing. There are also  issues of how people view others and view the past. I reiterate what I said in  the Chamber on 29 September &mdash; the comments made by Gerry Kelly on the  television programme about the Maze Prison breakout have set back community  relations in Northern    Ireland by several years. There was no sense  of remorse for the actions of that day; no sense of deep regret for what  happened. That absence of any sense of remorse has been damaging for community  relations and for the creation of a shared and better future.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Naomi Long said that most progress was made under direct  rule. She referred to the creation of the shared future strategy and the  triennial action plan. Progress, or at least developments, took place under  direct rule. However, it was done with very little political input and very  little sense of ownership, and the resultant document was a poor one.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is a crucial issue, and we should take our time to get  it right.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  appreciate that the strategy did not have a huge input from political parties.  However, does the Member acknowledge that the consultation on &lsquo;A Shared Future&rsquo;  received an unprecedented level of response &mdash; over 10,000 responses &mdash; from  across the community?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  Irrespective of the number of letters that are manufactured and sent in, the  process is flawed if politicians, who are the elected voice of the entire  community, do not have a share in it. Indeed, even Naomi Long acknowledged that  the document is flawed. The issue of a shared future is fundamental; therefore,  we must set about the process properly and get it right.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Several of this morning&rsquo;s newspapers refer to the creation  of a shared future in the world of sport. The Minister of Culture, Arts and  Leisure has made a number of significant references in recent weeks to the need  for the Gaelic Athletic Association to make changes to its ethos to create a  better shared future for the world of sport. Unionists from across the unionist  family have acknowledged that the GAA has made some changes but have  highlighted the need for further change. The problem is that both Sinn F&eacute;in and  the SDLP have failed to support that call. Those parties have failed to promote  the need for change towards a shared future in the realm of sport.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I ask the Member to draw his remarks to a close.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  This matter is crucial, and it must be dealt with properly.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Ba mhaith liom mo thaca&iacute;ocht a  thabhairt don r&uacute;n.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion. The deputy First Minister is  committed to good relations based on equality. Indeed, Martin McGuinness has  stated that OFMDFM:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;will introduce a programme of cohesion, sharing and  integration to tackle sectarianism and racism, which will refresh the previous  Administration&rsquo;s separate but associated policies on good relations and good  race relations.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official Report, Vol 30, No 1, p26, col 1].</span></span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As Martina Anderson said, the Committee for the Office of  the First Minister and deputy First Minister was reminded last Wednesday that  the strategy for cohesion, sharing and integration will be presented to the  Committee before the Halloween recess; that is a welcome development. It is the  role of the Department &mdash; in which the First Minister, the deputy First Minister  and their colleagues operate &mdash; to preside over the delivery of a clear, shared  vision of the type of society that we want to live in.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Contrary to the First Minister&rsquo;s recent arrogance, the  First Minister and the deputy First Minister are effectively joint Ministers. I  hope that Peter Robinson will respect that fact in the time ahead.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The strategy refers to the role of local government. The  Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister must support delivery at  local level, and district councils are key in this matter. Statutory mechanisms  are required to institute power sharing wherever it is resisted or refused,  often by unionist-dominated councils east of the River Bann.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The situation is different west of the Bann. One of the  d&rsquo;Hondt systems of proportionality has been practised in the four Tyrone  councils and in places such as Fermanagh, south Derry  &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  The Member will not give way.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The d&rsquo;Hondt system has also ensured that unionists are  treated equally on Derry City Council &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Member has the floor.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Unionists are treated equally on Derry City Council regarding the allocation of  senior posts. Similarly, in 2007-08, Bert Wilson of the Ulster Unionist Party  was chairman and Clive McFarland of the DUP was vice chairman of Omagh District  Council. I am a member of that council, on which nationalists predominate in  numbers.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">For 2008-09, Dungannon and South Tyrone Borough Council has  a DUP mayor and a DUP deputy mayor, and, again, the majority of the council&rsquo;s  representatives are nationalists.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  The Member praises, and properly supports, the use of d&rsquo;Hondt in local  councils. Does he also support the use of d&rsquo;Hondt for the appointment of a  Minister for justice?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member can have one extra minute of speaking time.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Thank you very much for the extra minute, Mr Speaker &mdash; I will need it.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Those unionist Members who are listening to, and  participating in, the debate today could do cohesion and integration a favour  by spreading the message &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  No, the Member will not give way.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">They could spread the message to places such as Limavady,  Larne and Lisburn. Individual Ministers have a major role to play in fostering  tolerance, equality and good relations in the North &mdash; and Nelson McCausland  mentioned that himself.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am speaking as an individual MLA, not in my capacity as  Chairperson of the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure. The Minister who is  perhaps most in default is Gregory Campbell. His public utterances and conduct  since assuming office have been, at best, ungracious and begrudging towards  organisations that have a Gaelic Ireland outlook, and, at worst, insulting and  offensive.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  The Member will not give way.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On Friday 26 September, the &lsquo;Belfast Telegraph&rsquo; &mdash; which is  hardly a Sinn F&eacute;in propaganda sheet &mdash; featured a piece from the columnist  Lawrence White. He said of Gregory Campbell:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;If he finds mixing with GAA types or Irish language  groups offensive, then he should simply resign from his post.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">An article in &lsquo;The Irish News&rsquo; on Tuesday 30 September stated:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s impossible to connect Campbell&rsquo;s two weeks of anti-GAA rhetoric to  the incident in Down&rdquo;,</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">where a GAA club was burned down. It went on to say:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;However, Campbell  must ask himself if his recent comments helped to foster a greater sense of  understanding and respect towards the GAA.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure must face  increased scrutiny. He constantly insults the largest sporting and cultural  organisation in Ireland  &mdash; including in the Six Counties. If he is unfit for office and incapable of  showing respect to other people&rsquo;s traditions, and if he wants to remain in the  trenches, he should consider his position as Minister with responsibility for  culture and sport.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  Who better to follow in this debate than Mr McElduff from West Tyrone. He was  very quick to tell us about some council areas in the west of the Province. I  sit on one of those councils, and I suggest that some of Mr McElduff&rsquo;s d&rsquo;Hondt  proposals are really just window dressing and do not get to the crux of matter &mdash;  sharing with unionist counterparts in those councils.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">He mentioned Fermanagh earlier, so let us consider  Fermanagh. Many symbols and memorabilia were removed from the offices and  chamber of Fermanagh District Council. They stopped the flying of the Union  flag &mdash; the flag of this Province &mdash; on council buildings. Therefore, do not tell  me that nationalists and republicans from west of the Bann support equality.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McCausland touched on the GAA. Let us be blunt, folks:  if we are to promote cohesion and the sharing of responsibilities in the  Province, people must get real about some of the hurts that have been caused in  communities &mdash; and that applies to both sides of the community. Let us consider  the GAA for a moment. I happened to be in Lisnaskea yesterday, where car loads  of GAA supporters drove up and down Main    Street at 6.00 pm, blaring horns, waving flags and  sitting on the doors of cars.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">If nothing else, doing that presented a danger to the  people involved and to the public. The local Protestant unionist community was  intimidated by those people&rsquo;s actions.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">1.15 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">People must gauge such incidents in that community for what  they are. I am happy for people to celebrate their culture, and I want to  respect that culture, but they must do it in such a way that will allow us to  respect it. However, I have yet to see evidence of that. Those people can drive  about with the flags of their GAA team flying from their cars, and that is  fine, provided that they realise the hurt and intimidation that they are  causing to some people in the minority community in that area. They must  respect that community.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I am into cohesion and sharing, so yes.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Will the Member accept that he contributed to negative community relations in County Fermanagh?  When the whole county was in a euphoric mood about the progress of its Gaelic  football team, he made a public statement saying that he hoped that Fermanagh&rsquo;s  Gaelic football team would be beaten. That set back community relations and  caused shock and dismay in the county.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I thank the Member for his interjection, because it allows me to clarify my  position. If Mr McElduff had read the report accurately, he would realise that  I did not say that I hoped that the Fermanagh team would lose. I said that some  constituents, who are members of my community, told me that they were sick,  sore and tired of listening to nothing but GAA at work. They had had enough of  it, and, for once, they were saying that they wanted the team to lose. They  were so fed up that they did not want it to continue for another three weeks.  Those people experienced serious intimidation from their work colleagues, in an  area where, in an office of about 10 people, only two might come from the  Protestant unionist community. Ordinarily, those people would have joined in  such discussions, but, because of the intimidation factor &mdash; something that Mr  McElduff and his colleagues must get into their heads &mdash; those people did not  feel included.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As a member of the Orange Institution, I have debated on  public platforms with members of the GAA, and I am happy to do so. However,  those people will not be able to move on unless they start to respect our  tradition. It does not help matters when IRA or republican commemorations take  place at GAA grounds. The organisers of those events need to be careful, as do  the owners of the grounds at which those events take place.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McElduff mentioned a statement that Mr Campbell made  about a GAA club that was burned down. I totally condemn that act and hope that  Members on the other side of the Chamber will condemn the acts of people who  have burnt down Orange Halls throughout the Province over the years.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>: I  begin by expressing my personal condolences to the deputy First Minister,  Martin McGuinness, on the death of his mother, Peggy. She was a very kind,  charming woman, who was loved not only by her family but by her many neighbours  and the wider community across the city. I offer condolences to Martin  McGuinness and to the wider McGuinness family.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The fact that we have power-sharing arrangements here is a  great example of progress for our society, but politicians sharing the  corridors of power cannot be the end of the journey. We must ensure that we  have a society in which we truly share the streets where we live and in which  we share the terraces of sports grounds and all the playgrounds, including  school playgrounds. Therefore, we need determined policies, programmes and  strategies to ensure that we build a community that is ever more united on the  basis of being ever more equal. We must work on the basis of respect and of  being respected, and on the basis of identifying, reversing and removing  inequality, injustice and hardship. That should be our common commitment. That  is why we must have a strategy for cohesion, sharing and integration.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The OFMDFM Ministers are not always present when the  Assembly debates the work of that Department, so I welcome the fact that junior  Minister Kelly is here today. I hope that he will use his time to reassure us  that when OFMDFM Ministers talk about introducing a programme &mdash; as opposed to a  strategy &mdash; it will not mean a lesser commitment than we might expect from a  strategy. Words are often used in different ways in order to mean less than that  which is required or intended. I hope that Mr Kelly will be able to spell out  the commitment that is envisaged when the OFMDFM Ministers use the word  &ldquo;programme&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;strategy&rdquo;.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">All equality should be equal. That is why such a strategy  must address a range of issues, including racism and other prejudices that  people suffer in our society, whether they are being attacked for their  sexuality or for other factors. We must be clear that we cannot have a strategy  that is so comprehensive that it does not specifically confront sectarianism,  or is uncomfortable in doing so. There must be a full-frontal assault on  sectarianism in all its forms. Some of us have concerns about some of the  language that is being bandied about &mdash; the way in which some matters are being  rebranded &mdash; because that might lead to a lessening of the focus on sectarianism  itself.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mention was made of the lack of progress during the  previous period of devolution. I am on public record as saying that I felt  somewhat embarrassed that, when I was Deputy First Minister, we could not  publish &lsquo;A Shared Future&rsquo;. That was partly because the then First Minister felt  that even in a consultation document, a question about the idea of a shared  society could be dangerous. He felt that the unionist community would react  very badly even to the notion of a shared society. He based that view on  experiences that people had had as a result of employment legislation and the  idea that a shared workplace meant a neutral workplace &mdash; that there was a  dimmer switch for Britishness while the volume was being pumped up on  Irishness.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">For my part, I thought that if those were the issues and  concerns that people had, we really needed a debate and nationalists needed to  hear the unionist view and experience if we were to truly understand the issues  and move forward. Regrettably, it was left to the direct rule Administration to  publish a document that progressed some of the good work that had been  commissioned from Jeremy Harbison and others during the previous period of devolution  and which asked some very challenging questions. We can ask each other  challenging questions in this Chamber, but, as others have said, we must all  ask ourselves challenging questions. I hope that the strategy, when it appears,  will challenge us all.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive can do much good, as can Members in the  Chamber. Were a Civic Forum to be put in place, it could achieve a great deal  on social inclusion and the cohesion, sharing and integration strategy.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member must bring his remarks to a close.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>: I  hope that we can use a revived Civic Forum to formulate some policy-outriding  work on those areas.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. We are discussing a very important  document, so it is crucial that we get it right. We must also remember that the  OFMDFM Ministers have told us that the document will be presented to the OFMDFM  Committee before the Halloween recess.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The new strategy should emphasise that equality will be  recognised, and not used simply as a smokescreen or as a form of tokenism. Good  relations must be defined in accordance with the 1998 Act, which clearly  identified that good relations are based on:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;due regard to the need to promote equality&rdquo;.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The NIO&rsquo;s purpose behind A Shared Future was simply to  ignore inequalities, deprivation and patterns of exclusion and to create a  smokescreen behind which it could say that it was building good community  relations, but that people should ignore and set aside their aspirations for  the future.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: On  the subject of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 and its good-relations provisions  &mdash; which the Member&rsquo;s colleague Martina Anderson mentioned earlier &mdash; does Mr  Molloy agree with me that there is a case for amending that Act so that the  good-relations provisions apply not just to race and religion, but to all the  section 75 categories, including, most notably, sexual orientation?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>: I  thank the Member for his intervention. Section 75 represents the primary  legislation that deals with those matters and is, therefore, what we should  primarily be concerned with. Obviously, that can be discussed in meetings of  the OFMDFM Committee.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We must recognise that &lsquo;A Shared Future&rsquo; is simply a  smokescreen, and that there is a need for a new strategy to deal with equality.  Forty years ago, the civil rights campaign was batoned off the streets of Derry because it dared to raise the issues of equality  and justice, at that time in respect of Catholics and Protestants. Now, we live  in a multicultural society that includes many nationalities, and it must be  recognised that racism has become a major issue. Racism, coupled with  sectarianism, leaves us with a major problem on our hands. It must be  recognised that the recently formed communities here must be consulted and must  be involved in the production of any policy documentation in the future. Such  documents must not simply involve a tokenistic inclusion of those communities,  and must not ignore their needs.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to recognise that, during debates such as  this, every party seems to be in agreement on the issues of sharing, cohesion  and integration, and yet, during other debates &mdash; when discussing the need for  an Irish language Act, for example &mdash; that does not appear to be the case;  integration falls to one side. When discussing Gaelic games, integration falls  to one side &mdash; in fact, the debate becomes very aggressive. When discussing the  rights of Travellers, again we find that integration is not an issue that  society wants to recognise.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  When driving through Dungiven the other day, I noticed that the hurling club  there &mdash; for which there is a large sign on the main street &mdash; is named the Kevin  Lynch Hurling Club. Does the Member believe that naming a hurling club after a  convicted terrorist contributes to the creation of a shared and better future?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Nelson declined to mention that Kevin Lynch, who is highly respected in the  Dungiven area of County Derry, was the captain of Dungiven&rsquo;s under-16 hurling  team when they won an all-Ireland title, and that he also lined out for Derry.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  Will the Member tell us what rank that individual also held in a terrorist  organisation?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>: I  am the Member who gave way, and although I thank my colleague for his  co-operation, I will attempt to get back on course. It is important to remember  that Kevin Lynch was a freedom fighter and a hunger striker. He was held in  very high esteem by the local community, and the Gaelic team for which he  played was named after him. If one looks through the history of any society or  organisation, one will find that many have been named after various people, at  various times, for various reasons. That does not mean that they should not be  integrated, or that the Gaelic Athletic Association should be isolated, and  deprived of funding and resources by the Assembly.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There are other issues that concern groups of people who  are not allowed to be integrated &mdash; the victims of the past, for example. Some  parties hold to the interpretation that there are different classes of victims.  That issue must be dealt with.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members have spoken very strongly against the  reintegration of ex-prisoners into society, and their need to be able to adapt  to all aspects of society in their normal working routine. If we are really  talking about integration, we must be genuine about it.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Jim Shannon made the point that, in meetings of the OFMDFM  Committee, there is a very open discussion of the issues of integration and  victims, and the other issues with which we are dealing. If we are to have a  genuine discussion on those matters, it is important that we take into account  the factors that affect all sides of the community, that we start to deal with  those in a realistic way, and do not simply create a smokescreen. The proposed  amendment to the motion creates a smokescreen. It is very important that we  discuss the document and give it due consideration.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">1.30 pm</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister) (Mr G Kelly)</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I am pleased to have an opportunity to  speak to the motion.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion and the amendment ask the First Minister and  deputy First Minister to: publish the strategy for cohesion, sharing and  integration immediately; detail how the strategy will promote reconciliation;  explain how the strategy will help the Executive&rsquo;s commitment to the  eradication of poverty; and produce an action plan to tackle segregation in  schools, housing and leisure facilities. I will address each of those issues,  but I also want to reassure people in the Assembly, and those outside the  Chamber who may catch snatches of the debate on TV or in the newspapers, that  we are fully committed to tackling division.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As outlined in legislation and policy, the Executive are  committed to equality for all sections of our community. All Ministers in  OFMDFM support the building of constructive cross-community work, which is now  part of everyday life. All Ministers in OFMDFM are wholeheartedly working to  eliminate sectarianism, racism, division, polarisation and prejudice. The  Executive have fully supported those commitments and objectives in the  strategic priorities and cross-cutting themes of the Programme for Government.  All Members here are wholly committed to a shared and better future for all.  Despite the disagreements, every Member who spoke in the debate spoke up for  that cause.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Before I address the specific issues that the motion  raises, I want people in communities to hear a united and shared message from  the Chamber that building our new future is a unified and unifying task. The  rough and tumble of political debate in the Assembly must not discourage those  dedicated people who take serious personal risks to bridge deeply felt  division. I am sure that I speak for all Members by saying that our society  requires everyone to work together to secure the new relationships that are  growing in so many places. We want that work to continue and be built on to  create a shared and better future for all. We will not shy away from tackling  head-on the difficult and challenging issues that face us.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The question about publishing the strategy for cohesion,  sharing and integration, and the involvement of the OFMDFM Committee in that,  is straightforward for me to answer. During Question Time on 29 September 2008,  the deputy First Minister confirmed that the draft strategy will be submitted  to the OFMDFM Committee before the Halloween recess. That was reiterated when  the First Minister and deputy First Minister appeared before that Committee on  1 October 2008. To reassure other Members, the strategy will be presented to  the Assembly, and the programme proposals will be subject to full consultation  and an equality impact assessment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I emphasise that, considerable work has been done on the  strategy over the past 12 months, in line with all inherited policies. We made  a joint decision to fundamentally examine the strategy to establish whether it  was fit for purpose for the new dispensation. We want to make the strategy as  effective, ambitious and comprehensive as possible, and we are moving strongly  in the right direction. Several Members mentioned that everything that was done  before is being abandoned. That is a myth. We are trying to refresh and rebuild  existing strategies.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There are some preliminary comments to make before I  address how the strategy will promote reconciliation. First, the strategy must  be seen in the context of the legislation and policies that promote equality  across all sections of our community. The strategy will also sit alongside  existing policies on tackling and ending hate crime and promoting respect for  diversity. We will not consign to the dustbin the work that people have done  and the successes that they have achieved. The exercise is about consolidating,  building on and resourcing tried and tested good practice. We must be  innovative to ensure that the strategy is targeted at the changing face of  communities and society.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, I want to address the myth that we have shelved  the promotion of community relations &mdash; nothing could be further from the truth.  Over the past 18 months, all the OFMDFM Ministers and their departmental  officials have actively led and supported work on the ground, and I know that  many Members have done so too. However, from a ministerial and departmental  perspective, I am pleased to highlight the increased funding of &pound;7 million for  good relations and good race relations that was secured in the 2007 spending  review as an example of our commitment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">That increase has already been provided during the current  year &mdash; for example, to minority ethnic groups, which now receive funding of  approximately &pound;1 million. The involvement of junior Minister Donaldson and me,  during the summer, with the working group that focuses on issues in north Belfast has brought about  a &pound;100,000 increase for youth-intervention schemes. Thanks to that support for  people who work at interfaces, improvement has continued throughout the summer  months.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As I turn to the focus of the new strategy, I do not want  to go too far ahead of our discussions with the Committee. However, I will  explain some of our priorities: to tackle the visible manifestations of  sectarianism, racism and intolerance; to dismantle peace walls, with  communities&rsquo; support; to work with communities who live in interface areas to  eliminate sectarian attacks, youth rioting and civil disorder; to tackle the  incidence of, and reasons for, racial attacks; to provide and expand safe and  shared spaces and public services; and to support local people, with the  participation of minority-ethnic groups, to deal with local issues through  local solutions.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have included that list in order to give a flavour of the  practical objectives that the strategy seeks to achieve. By promoting  reconciliation in a practical way, we seek to challenge and support communities  to become places where any person, regardless of race, colour, religion,  political opinion or sexual orientation can live, work, rest and socialise in  an environment of tolerance, respect, safety and freedom from hate and  violence.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Central Government believe that strong political leadership  is essential for the success of the strategy. The establishment of a new  Minister-led good-relations panel will drive and oversee the work throughout  Government, in local government, and with key stakeholders to tackle the type  of issues that I have mentioned. A strategic action plan and locally delivered  action plans will be developed and implemented, and will skilfully take account  of all good relations and race-relations issues through complementary  bottom-up, top-down approaches. Those are ambitious and comprehensive  objectives. It is not only necessary, but essential, for everyone to accept  them. I firmly believe that they are achievable and that they reflect people&rsquo;s  aspirations.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">How will the strategy help to eradicate poverty? As Members  are aware, the economy is a key aspect of the Executive&rsquo;s Programme for  Government. Wealth creation and job creation must and will impact on all areas  of social and physical development. Just as we want to share in the peace  bonus, so, too, must economic regeneration benefit everyone in society.  Successful economic development must include all sectors &mdash; Government,  business, education, and the community and voluntary sector. A stable society  is needed in which children can play together, people can work together and  families can live happily side by side, regardless of their community, ethnic  background or beliefs. That mutual acceptance and respect are the determining  factors that will foster a stable, prosperous and growing economy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">During the past several years, a Cheann Comhairle, there  has been economic growth and job creation. However, there are concerns that not  all sections of the community have participated nor, indeed, benefited from  that growth. People who live at interface areas must be able to see and feel on  the ground the impact of the good-relations policy. It is not sufficient to say  that the policy works: that must be seen and felt by people on the front line.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The anti-poverty strategy will be based on the life-cycle  approach in order to tailor solutions to each group&rsquo;s particular needs. We are  committed to actively target and deal with social need. We want that work to be  taken forward by a new ministerial anti-poverty subcommittee. The core  principal was made explicit by the Programme for Government&rsquo;s (PFG) commitment:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;to develop new and innovative measures that will  address existing patterns of socio-economic disadvantage and target resources  and efforts towards those in greatest objective need.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The application of the principle of a shared and  better future for all has a cross-cutting theme. The programme will ensure that  Departments direct efforts and resources towards areas, groups and individuals  in greatest objective need, including disabled people, children, families and  older people who live in poverty.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive already has a broad range of programmes that  are aimed directly at targeting social need and patterns of disadvantage, for  example, Sure Start, winter fuel payments and measures to tackle rural poverty.  However, the concept of a better and shared future for all applies equally to  high-level strategies, such as the investment strategy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive, in agreeing the PFG, have set challenging  targets on poverty, and on child poverty in particular. They are committed to eradicating  child poverty by 2020 and halving the numbers of children in poverty by 2010.  From an early stage, the Executive have sought to ensure that the concepts of  equality and good relations are firmly embedded in the approach to developing  the PFG and investment strategy. They wanted to ensure that, in the growth of  the economy and creation of the shared and better future, no group would be  left behind. That is a key aim; and it underpins the entire PFG. It is  reflected in the priority they give to promotion of tolerance, inclusion,  health and well-being. In line with that, The Executive have set a range of  ambitious targets to address the causes and consequences of inequality,  intolerance and division, and to break the cycle of poverty, disadvantage and  marginalisation.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive are determined to support the most vulnerable  and to ensure that everyone lives in a strong vibrant and sustainable way that  enhances the quality of life and encourages everyone to realise his or her  potential. That is why we will focus on building shared communities,  regenerating communities, removing barriers to employment, removing physical  barriers that divide communities and addressing significant inequalities in  health and education outcomes.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that I have addressed most of the issues raised by  Members. In her party political broadcast, Carmel Hanna referred to separate  and segregated housing. We recognise people&rsquo;s aspirations to live in  unsegregated housing; we support the work of the Housing Executive, which is substantially  funded by the International Fund for Ireland, and we are conscious of  the primacy of need. We will work with the Housing Executive to balance need  with the shared aspiration to build communities in all areas. It is also  important that we work closely with the communities themselves.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Naomi Long spoke of the detailed action plans among other  things. As I said already, the Executive&rsquo;s strategy emphasises that actions  must be locally based, take account of local needs and identify local  solutions. We agree that physical action is important, but it is also important  that we do not impose plans on communities. Involving communities is vital.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Jim Shannon said that OFMDFM should publish the strategy  only after consultation with the Committee: I have already addressed that  point.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Martina Anderson said &mdash; not for the first time &mdash; that there  should be no hierarchy of equality. We agree that equality and good relations  are joint priorities and that they are mutually reinforcing. Contacts must  result in substantial changes in attitudes and behaviours. We want to see the  policy make a real difference to people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Danny Kennedy said that delay in publishing the strategy is  destabilising the institutions and suggested that it is paying lip-service to  the concept of a shared and better future. I have addressed those issues. Mr  Kennedy&rsquo;s concern, that a shared and better future is no longer a priority, is  misplaced. We need to focus on what we are doing. The rough and tumble of  debate should not ignore the real action that is being taken: otherwise, we run  the risk that those we support, and who work so diligently and effectively, may  be discouraged.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Barry McElduff, Naomi Long and Tom Elliott mentioned the  role of local government. We must recognise that many useful projects are being  supported by all district councils. Difficult issues are being worked through  by people in both communities, and it is important that we, the elected  political representatives, lead by example.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mark Durkan asked whether the introduction of a  &ldquo;programme&rdquo;, as opposed to a &ldquo;strategy&rdquo;, signified a lesser commitment; Carmel  Hanna also spoke about that. I assure both Members that that is not the  Executive&rsquo;s view. The change of a word does not signal a reduction in priority.  The response I gave earlier to Carmel Hanna&rsquo;s point should assure everyone that  the housing issue is being dealt with in that manner.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Another issue was raised by Nelson McCausland. Every Member  who spoke &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The junior Minister&rsquo;s time is almost up.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior Minister (Office of the First  Minister and deputy First Minister)(Mr G Kelly): </strong>I will be brief. I  welcome Nelson McCausland&rsquo;s statement that equality, diversity and  interdependence are crucial.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I shall step out of my role as junior Minister to speak as  a private Member for a moment. History is history &mdash; I was involved in the Maze  escape, and I make no apologies for that. Mr McCausland&rsquo;s consistent verbal  attacks on the GAA are not helping community relations either. Go raibh maith  agat.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">1.45 pm</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: At  the outset, I declare an interest as a member of the Community Relations  Council. I thank the Members who tabled the motion for accepting our amendment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Looking back, &lsquo;A Shared Future&rsquo; was a good start, but it  was not a perfect document, particularly because there was a lack of political  buy-in. However, much progress was made, and an action plan flowed from &lsquo;A  Shared Future&rsquo;. In the same light, the cohesion, sharing and integration  strategy, whenever it is published, is unlikely to be perfect. However, we must  make a start. Like the Minister, I do not want to go into detail anticipating  what may be in that document.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The community has a number of concerns. First, it is  concerned that good community-relations issues will go back into the silo of  OFMDFM. When that issue was part of &lsquo;A Shared Future&rsquo;, emphasis was placed on a  cross-departmental strategy. Some people fear that we may lose that overarching  framework.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, although the Minister said that a shared and  better future is an underlying theme in the Programme for Government, the  public service agreements (PSAs) associated with that document exhibit little  joined-up action on community-relations issues. It is feared that local action  will be overemphasised, at the expense of an overarching regional strategy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Thirdly, there is concern about the lack of a concrete  action plan and the lack of accountable bodies, be they Departments or  agencies, to develop the proposals. Our amendment tries to emphasise those  points.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Those visions cut across all public policy in Northern Ireland  and affect all strands of society. When one talks about economics, one must  look at the impact on labour mobility and the way in which investment is  deterred. Frankly, we cannot prioritise economic development in the Assembly  and the Executive if we do not acknowledge the impact of division. The Alliance  Party has raised the issue of finance on many occasions.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members, including Jim Shannon, spoke about the social  aspects of a divided society and how those are linked to deprivation. Members  are aware of the human aspect, in that, whenever people are not contact with  one another, they lose the ability to develop to their full potential, and, as  a consequence, society loses out.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Environmentally, it is now clear that divided societies  have larger carbon footprints. That point may go over the head of the Minister  of the Environment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Those points illustrate the need for joined-up action among  Departments and stress the importance of having a coherent action plan.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to comment on some Members&rsquo; contributions. It was a  largely productive debate, with the exception of those Members whose  contributions went down a few blind alleys.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Carmel Hanna raised the issue of housing. I acknowledge  Margaret Ritchie&rsquo;s work on shared housing. She has been proactive, yet much  more must be done.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Although we welcome the fact that the Department now talks  about people&rsquo;s right to live in mixed areas, the other side of the coin is the  right of people to live in a segregated neighbourhood &mdash; a single-identity area.  In the strange world of Northern    Ireland, it may seem perfectly reasonable,  based on religious identity, to live in a single-identity area. However, if a  society were to introduce a policy whereby people had the right to live in  single-identity areas based on race, there would be international outrage. We  must look carefully at the real implications of our statements on the current  housing policy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Jim Shannon and Martina Anderson mentioned resources and  that new funds are to go to OFMDFM. That the money is going to OFMFDM more or  less makes my point for me. We must see what other Departments are spending on  their good-relations strategies. Education is one area in which huge  opportunities exist for sharing and, in the long run, saving resources.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members mentioned the issue of equality and the  good-relations function. In my intervention, I was trying to make the point  that there is a distinction between the breadth of groups listed under section  75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 and those listed under the good-relations  function, which applies to race and religion only. That must be broadened if  there is to be a genuine, robust system of equality and good relations.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Danny Kennedy spoke of pluralism as the way forward. That  is fine, but not if it means entrenching divisions in Northern Ireland.  Pluralism, in a positive sense, must be about more than two communities, and  must value diversity. I urge support for the amendment and the motion.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I thank the Alliance Party for its support for the motion, and I commend all  Members who have supported it.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">If rhetoric were the measure of commitment to good  relations and reconciliation in the community, we would have no problems. Every  Member who has spoken has mentioned the necessity of the promotion of good  relations and of reconciliation, as well as the need for the creation of a more  equal society in Northern    Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">That is to be welcomed. However, a real commitment to that  process is required on the part of the Executive. The unpardonable delay in the  production of a document &mdash; whether it be a strategy or a programme &mdash; is deeply  regrettable. The House has been assured by the junior Minister that the  document will be produced by Halloween. He did not say which Halloween.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister) (Mr G Kelly)</strong>:  This Halloween.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  He has clarified the position, Mr Speaker. We look forward to the production of  that document by Halloween, because there have been many false dawns in reaching  that stage.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly, the Executive and the other institutions of  the Good Friday Agreement have one central purpose &mdash; to reconcile all our  people, to create partnership, and, through that partnership, to bring about a  sustainable peace here for future generations. The Assembly must realise that  this is a conflict resolution process, not a conflict substitution process.  Unfortunately, some Members adhere to the latter.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is clear that there is general goodwill towards moving  in the right direction. I commend those who have spoken in those terms today.  However, there is a problem in respect of equality in this society. One cannot  exclude equality and have good community relations &mdash; both go together. Neither  can economic opportunity be excluded; we must have that. That is why it is  important that the document also tackles poverty in our society. My party and I  recommend that the Executive take on board statutory targets to try to  eliminate poverty.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive and the Office of the First Minister and  deputy First Minister purport to be dedicated to the elimination of poverty,  particularly among children, and yet the Executive fund that was set up to  tackle that very problem has been abolished. That is to be deeply regretted.  That fund was pioneered by the first Executive, and it was of great value and  importance.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Some of the remarks that were made by Tom Elliott about the  system of local government and about the d&rsquo;Hondt system, in particular, are  regrettable. D&rsquo;Hondt is a very important mechanism for bringing about power  sharing in local councils &mdash; it is not superficial; it is a real sharing of  power at local government level.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I wish to clarify my position. I did not criticise the method or the use of  d&rsquo;Hondt in the western council areas. I indicated that there is still an  underlying sectarianism and division that must be tackled.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I am glad that the Member clarified his point. D&rsquo;Hondt is not the only  mechanism &mdash; we can have others, we can improve on d&rsquo;Hondt and we can improve on  the sharing of power and the building of partnerships. I agree with the Member  that there is an underlying sectarianism in all councils and throughout our  society. Our central role must be &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  During the course of my remarks, Mr Maginness asked me to clarify matters  pertaining to the use of d&rsquo;Hondt. With his legal background, he will know that  the Act is paramount in this matter. When a new Department is established,  which might necessitate the dissolution of an existing Department, section 17  of the 1998 Act takes effect. Subsection 4 of the Act states that:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The number of Ministerial offices shall not exceed 10  or such greater number as the Secretary of State may by order provide.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Subsection 5 states that:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;A determination  under subsection (1) shall not have effect unless it is approved by a  resolution of the Assembly passed with cross-community support.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP mantra that d&rsquo;Hondt simply has to be triggered so  that it can get its hands on the ministerial post for policing and justice is  illegal under that 1998 Act, and I will arrange for a copy of it to be left in  the Member&rsquo;s pigeonhole.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I thank the Member for belatedly replying to my point; it must have taken quite  some time for the Sinn F&eacute;in office to work out that strategy, which he has very  carefully read. Of course it is not illegal; d&rsquo;Hondt is the proper system for  the appointment of Ministers, and departing from that is to depart from a  central aspect of the Good Friday Agreement. Unfortunately, that is what Sinn F&eacute;in  has done &mdash; it has weakened the d&rsquo;Hondt system. It is sad that the Member has to  stand up and justify that instead of supporting the right of an SDLP member to  be appointed as Minister for justice.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  Mr McElduff addressed the issue of what happens regarding the first devolved  justice Minister. However, the letter from Martin McGuinness and Peter Robinson  of 29 July states that at all times the Minister of justice is to be appointed  by cross-community support &mdash; a complete departure from the agreement. We are  talking about a veto that will be used not just against the SDLP now, but  against Sinn F&eacute;in in the future. That is the significance of the mistakes that  Sinn F&eacute;in is making.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I will move on &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  No, I think that you have made your point. If the Assembly has any task it is  to tackle sectarianism, individually and collectively. It is important to say  that publicly and to do that through our actions; that has always been my  policy as a politician. I strongly reject any criticism, implied or explicit,  made against me today. The SDLP remains committed to the promotion of good  relations, to the ending of sectarianism and to the creation of reconciliation  in our society, and that should be the task for us all. If this debate has done  any good, it has been to highlight the importance of that commitment. That  commitment should bring about agreement amongst those in the Office of the  First Minister and deputy First Minister, and that office should expedite a  process whereby we can achieve that.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Good spirit was shown this morning through the condolences  expressed by the First Minister to the deputy First Minister. That human touch  was very moving and something to be genuinely welcomed.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">If Members could translate that into daily actions in the  Assembly, it would act as a model and an example to the community for people,  collectively and individually, to tackle the problem of sectarianism, whether  in sport, the workplace, housing, education, or elsewhere. That would be a  marvellous contribution to peace.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question, <span style="font-style:normal; ">That the  amendment be made</span>, put and agreed to.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Main Question, as amended, put and agreed to.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly expresses its concern at the delayed  publication of the Strategy for Cohesion, Sharing and Integration; calls on the  First Minister and deputy First Minister to publish their strategy without  further delay and to detail how this strategy will promote reconciliation, the  ideal of a truly shared future and how it will help the Executive&rsquo;s commitment  to eradicate poverty; and calls on the Executive to meet immediately to commit  to producing an action plan, led by the Office of the First Minister and deputy  First Minister, to tackle segregation in schools, housing and leisure  facilities.</p>
		    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="4"></a>Private Members&rsquo; Business</p>
		    <p class="H5StageHeading">Comber Greenway</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30 minutes for  the debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes in which to propose  and 10 minutes to make a winding-up speech. All other Members who wish to speak  will have five minutes.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Purvis</strong>: I  beg to move</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly acknowledges the health benefits that  outdoor exercise offers children and adults, including positive mental  well-being; recognises that safe walking and cycling routes contribute greatly  to this and are in short supply in urban areas; and calls on the Minister for  Regional Development to preserve safe pedestrian and cyclist access on the  Comber Greenway.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am delighted that the motion has been selected. At a time  when we are facing a difficult financial situation, there are important  quality-of-life issues that need our attention, and we must keep in mind the  whole picture with regard to quality of life. It is critical that we produce  real solutions in order to keep homes warm this winter and to help to keep  people in their homes in difficult times.</p>
		    <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr McClarty] in the Chair)</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Today, we also have an opportunity to examine the quality  of life and the health of the environment that we are offering to the people of  Northern Ireland  when they step outside their homes. At a time when the Executive are failing to  meet the needs of the people of Northern Ireland,  I am glad to have the chance to raise an important issue that affects the  everyday lives of the citizens of East Belfast  and all those who visit the area in order to use the Comber Greenway.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I acknowledge the important work that is being done by the  Department for Regional Development and the sustainable transportation charity,  Sustrans, in developing the Comber Greenway. Those organisations have created a  remarkable resource and a vast improvement in the quality of life for those  living along, and using, the Comber Greenway.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">For Members who have not had the delightful opportunity of  travelling along the path, the Comber Greenway is a seven-mile traffic-free  stretch along the old Belfast  to Comber railway line, which is being developed as part of the national cycle  network. The greenway runs from the heart of East Belfast to Comber, with views  along the route of Stormont and Scrabo   Tower.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The completed trail will be opened formally in November,  but stretches of the path have been made accessible to the public as they were  being upgraded over the past five years. The walking and cycling route provides  a tranquil, traffic-free environment for leisure walking and cycling, and  offers a safe, direct route to and from Belfast  city centre for those commuting by bicycle or on foot.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Comber Greenway is an oasis in what is otherwise a  largely urban setting. It is the type of outdoor resource that urban planners  everywhere dream of creating &mdash; an easily accessible, safe, attractive space for  exercise, leisure, pushing a pram, outdoor exploration and adventures for  children, chats among friends or teaching a child how to ride a bike.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Users are surrounded by green and are occasionally met by  local wildlife, including birds and badgers. Since the first stretches of the  improved greenway were opened, it has become hugely popular. User levels have  shot up exponentially each year and grow consistently as new stretches of the  path are opened. The Member for Strangford Mrs Iris Robinson has referred to  the Comber Greenway as the jewel in the crown of East   Belfast. That shows how badly residents needed and wanted such a  facility &mdash; and why not?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The benefits of having and using such a resource are so  significant that the people of Northern    Ireland are constantly hearing from elected  officials and Departments about how they should get out and use such facilities  more often. People are told to eat five portions of fruit and vegetables a day,  to limit the time that children spend in front of the computer and television  and to exercise for at least 30 minutes a day.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, mixed messages are being sent. After spending in  excess of &pound;900,000 on the conversion of the greenway into a traffic-free haven,  the Department for Regional Development now proposes to use five miles of the  greenway from the Holywood Arches to Dundonald as part of a bus rapid-transit  network, which will cost &pound;147 million. The Minister for Regional Development  has said that the new network will also preserve some form of path for  pedestrians and cyclists, but how could it? What could the quality of that  experience possibly be? How pleasant, safe and healthy could it possibly be to  walk, play or cycle along a path next to a massive vehicle travelling at 60  miles an hour?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Undoubtedly, physical movement produces physical and  mental-health benefits. The quality of the environment in which exercise takes  place has a profound impact on wellness and on whether people feel motivated to  take exercise. Physical activity reduces the risk of many major and chronic  illnesses, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke, colon cancer and obesity.  Unequivocally, exercise and exposure to fresh air create benefits to the body.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Everyone has stories about when they were young, and when I  was a child, being in the house was the exception. We played outside most of  the time. Any time that we did mope about the house, my granny was quick to  point out how good the air was for us. However, recent research documents  worrying trends about the overall health of society and, most importantly,  children. The UK Fit Futures report identified the greater use of cars;  parental reluctance to let children play outdoors due to concerns about traffic  and stranger danger; and the popularity of, and increased access to,  television, computers and other sedentary pastimes as threats to children&rsquo;s  overall activity levels.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">That report and similar Government reports refer to obesity  as a health time bomb and a national epidemic. According to the Fit Futures  report, obesity reduces life expectancy by approximately nine years. It is a  killer, and it increases the risk of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s biggest killer  diseases &mdash; coronary heart disease and cancer. Obesity is identified as a risk  marker in the young for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. The  financial implications that come with obesity are staggering. The estimated  economic cost of treating obesity and its related effects is several billion  pounds a year.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Children and young people from lower-income families are  more likely to eat a poor diet and less likely to participate in sport. Part of  the reason for that is their environment. Such families are less likely to live  in areas in which facilities for physical activity are safe and easily  accessible. The priorities that are set out in the Department of Health&rsquo;s fit  futures strategy propose to address the conflicting policies that are sometimes  promoted by Departments. The strategy proposes to address the disjointed  approach to the promotion of physical activity and to ensure that opportunities  for active play are available and accessible.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Comber Greenway provides those facilities for residents  of Tullycarnet, Beersbridge, Bloomfield, Orangefield and many other areas.  Accessibility is a real consideration in encouraging children and young people  to engage in physical activities and active play. The Comber Greenway provides  an ideal solution for many families and local residents. It is safe, clean,  inviting, accessible and free, and people do not have to get into a car to  enjoy it.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Obesity can impact on the emotional and psycho&shy;logical  well-being of young people, and exercise and physical activity not only reduce  the risk of obesity but offer benefits for mental health. There are clear  indications that exercise reduces the risk of suicide and self-harm and that it  boosts psychological well-being and cognitive functioning as it improves self  esteem. Suicide and self-harm rates are higher in economically deprived areas,  which also tend to be the areas that lack accessible, tranquil, ample green  space.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">At a time when official targets have been set for a  reduction in the incidence of suicide and self-harm, Members must see the whole  picture and ensure that all the necessary resources are in place to meet them.  That includes creating facilities and amenities, such as the Comber Greenway,  that enhance psychological well-being and are accessible to everyone.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The removal of more cars from the roads is a great idea.  Improved public transport, which the Department for Regional Development  identified as a strategic goal, would have the undeniable benefits of reduced  congestion, an improvement in air quality and increased safety for pedestrians,  cyclists and cars. I would support objectives to provide more affordable,  accessible and sustainable forms of public transport.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, many residents of east Belfast, particularly those living in the  estates and densely populated pockets of the city, already use buses and other  public transport. Car ownership in those areas is well below the UK average.  Those are not the people who must switch to public transport, because they  already hop on a bus to do their daily messages, take their children to school  or get to work. They are being penalised to accommodate those who have not  switched to public transport. The paving of the Comber Greenway means that they  will lose the little green space that they have.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The report by Atkins and KPMG, commissioned by the  Department to examine options for a rapid-transit system, stated that an  average of only 22% of passengers on the new bus system will have switched from  using their cars. The remaining 78% will comprise existing users of public  transport who will simply switch from one form of public transport to another.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member draw her remarks to a close?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Purvis</strong>: I  will.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to mention that the same report provides  options for the construction of a road. What good is a road when attempting to  create sustainable public transport? The Comber Greenway should remain a safe,  healthy and tranquil green space.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Purvis</strong>: I  ask my colleagues to support the motion and join me in preventing the Comber  Greenway from becoming the Comber &ldquo;Greyway&rdquo;.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Browne</strong>:  I am in broad agreement with the objectives expressed in the motion; walking  and cycling are major contributors to a healthy lifestyle. However, I also  recognise the importance of a good public transport system in Belfast,  particularly in East Belfast.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As all Members know, the Comber Greenway was previously a  railway line that ran from Belfast  to Comber. I remember as a boy &mdash; a very young boy, I might add &mdash; standing at Barnetts Bridge  and watching the steam trains go past on their way to Downpatrick and Newcastle. Indeed, I  could claim to be one of the original railway children. Unfortunately, previous  Administrations made the rather short-sighted decision that a railway was not  economically viable.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In today&rsquo;s climate of rising fuel prices and concern for  the environment, it is essential to get people out of their cars and on to  public transport by providing an efficient, reliable and low-cost public  transport system.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>:  The Member drew attention to the need for reliable public transport in East Belfast. Perhaps the Member will take on board that  when the new service is available, many of those who use it will simply be transferring  from the existing bus service. The Department stated that it could not conceive  that the 4A service will disappear, but neither could it commit to retaining  the current format whereby buses run every 10 minutes. Perhaps the Minister  will provide Members with more information on that today.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Browne</strong>:  I thank the Member for that information. I have faith in the consultants who  are producing the report, and I am sure that the Minister will be able to  address the problems that the Member raised.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The route provides a great opportunity to develop an  efficient transport link in the form of a rapid-bus network or light railway  system. Such a system would not necessarily impinge on the existing amenities  for walking and cycling.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In 1986, I suggested to Northern Ireland Railways that a  light tramway be provided on that route. Since then, car ownership has  increased dramatically, and the consequent rise in pollution levels has  vindicated my original argument.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On 3 June 2008, the Minister provided a useful synopsis on  the history of the amenity. He said:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;In 2003, work was undertaken to build a new sewer  along parts of the old railway line. That presented my Department with an  opportunity to create a walking and cycling route along the corridor while plans  for rapid transit were being progressed. That work was undertaken in the full  knowledge that the line would be used for rapid transit in the future&rdquo;. &mdash;<span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; "> [Official Report, Vol 31, No 3, p159, col 1].</span></span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, he explained that many people had expressed  concern about the future of the Comber Greenway for walking and cycling. As a  representative for East Belfast, I have  received numerous letters and emails from constituents &mdash; and individuals from  further afield &mdash; expressing similar concerns. On 3 June 2008, the Minister  said:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;I am conscious of the needs of walkers and cyclists  and I am keen to support both. I intend to retain a walking and cycling amenity  on that route. However, I will further consider the issues that have been  raised&rdquo;. &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official Report, Vol 31, No 3, p159, col 1].</span></span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In his summing-up speech, he expressed confidence that the  proposed rapid-transit system would:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;not push cyclists and walkers off the route.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official  Report, Vol 31, No 3, p169, col 1].</span></span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">What further consideration has the Minister given to health  and safety? In particular, how can the existing environmentally friendly  amenity for cyclists and walkers be preserved? In conclusion, I would welcome  an assurance from the Minister that, when a rapid-transport system is developed,  he will ensure that the valuable amenity that the Comber Greenway provides for  cyclists and walkers is not damaged. I support the motion.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. I hope that the Minister will not propose that I cycle to  work from the border. I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion, and I  thank the Members who proposed it. Sinn F&eacute;in understands the importance of  public health and the need to reduce the number of cars on the roads and to  promote the use of public transport.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion asks the House to acknowledge the benefits of a  healthy lifestyle. Exercise &mdash; such as walking and cycling in a safe environment  &mdash; is a significant and positive aspect of such a lifestyle. Sinn F&eacute;in supports  that concept, and I hope that all Members will welcome that common-sense  approach.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As a member of the Committee for Regional Development, I am  aware of public concerns about the Comber Greenway. When the Committee took  evidence from those who support the retention of the Comber Greenway, it was  conscious that people support its preservation. Moreover, it was conscious that  the Comber Greenway &mdash; which is situated along the old Comber railway line &mdash; has  been, for a long time, earmarked as a rapid-transit route into and out of East Belfast.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in believes that any proposed plans for a  rapid-transport system should cater for a safe pedestrian and cyclist route  that enables people to partake in exercise. Furthermore, we support the use of  green open space for shared recreational, environmentally friendly purposes.  The matter can be resolved through the retention of the cycle and walkway  facility, which will provide future economic, social and environmental benefits  for Belfast.  Sinn F&eacute;in supports the motion. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Sir Reg Empey</strong>:  This issue poses a dilemma for the Minister. He has a responsibility to ensure  high-quality public transport. However, there is a clash between two worthy  aims. I declare an interest as a local resident who uses the Comber Greenway  regularly. The popularity of that walkway is immense and increasing.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Lord Browne referred to the period in 2003 when the route  was dug up to lay a sewer. People in the area were concerned, as they wondered  whether it would be restored to its previous state. In the event, it was even  better after being restored and it grew substantially.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Along with the health issues to which other Members  referred, there are wildlife and amenity issues that need to be considered. It  must be remembered that the impact of what happens to that stretch of railway  line is not confined to East Belfast. It is a  potential transport route that affects how Comber and Newtownards could be  involved in a rapid-transit system.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Some concerns have been drawn to my attention. In broad  terms, people are aware of the Minister&rsquo;s intention to retain a cycling and  walking facility on the route. Many people do not see how those amenities could  be retained while having a rapid-transit system in parallel because the site is  narrow in places. That is something that the Minister could address in his  remarks.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Another issue concerns displacement. Will people simply be  moved from the Newtownards Road  onto the railway route? What are the economic consequences if that happens? For  commercial reasons, areas such as Ballyhackamore very often depend on people  travelling by bus. Will those areas be severely disadvantaged? Another question  that has not been satisfactorily answered is what happens when the  rapid-transit vehicles reach the end of the walkway at what used to be the  Holywood Arches. Do they simply join the line of traffic? How will that be  addressed in a satisfactory manner?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In her opening speech, Dawn Purvis quoted figures from the  KPMG report concerning the number of people who are likely to be new users of  the facility. It seemed like a very low figure for such an investment. It is  planned that approximately 3,000 dwellings will be built at the Comber end of  the route, but if that sort of money will be invested, I expected that it was  envisaged that a very substantial number of transfers and new customers would  use the route. I do not see where those people will come from.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Purvis</strong>:  There has been an extrapolation of the figures from the KPMG report, and it  might help the debate. Many of the cars come into Belfast from Dundonald. I am told that the  rapid-transit system will reduce the number of cars per minute from 66 to 62 at  peak times. The system will effectively take only four cars per minute off the  road.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Sir Reg Empey</strong>:  I am indebted to the Member for that information. It illustrates the point that  although we understand that that has been a long-term transport link, the fact  is that it has become a very significant amenity for local people. There is not  much green space in this city. The Comber Greenway has become very popular for  all the reasons that Members mentioned. When the Minister addresses the major  policy issues concerning this matter, I hope that he takes that fact into  account.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Where is the evidence of a real paradigm shift, with people  leaving their vehicles and using public transport? I do not see where that will  come from, and yet we could lose a type of amenity that is in very short supply  in the Belfast  area. If there are major housing developments in Dundonald, what evidence is  there that people who occupy those dwellings would use that amenity? Those are  the sorts of issues that need to be addressed &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Sir Reg Empey</strong>:  My time is almost up.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member will have an extra minute as he has already given way.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Sir Reg Empey</strong>:  OK.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: I  thank the Member for giving way. I am sure that he agrees that any developers  should make a financial contribution if they were to benefit from the  introduction of a rapid-transit system.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Sir Reg Empey</strong>:  I do not object to that, because planning gain is something for which we are  all pushing. I certainly hope that that would be the case. I still do not  understand how a wildlife-friendly leisure facility could be compatible with a  major transport link. I do not see how those go together.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have a major concern about displacement. What will happen  when one reaches the bottom of the walkway? How will the proposed rapid-transit  system link with the existing transport system? Those matters are of grave  concern to the local community.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:  As Question Time begins at 2.30 pm, I propose that Members take their ease  until that time. This debate will continue after Question Time, when the first  Member called to speak will be Dr Alasdair McDonnell.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The debate stood suspended.</p>

		    <p class="OralWrittenAnswersHeading"><a name="5"></a>Oral Answers to Questions</p>
		    <p class="H3SectionHeading">HEALTH, SOCIAL SERVICES&nbsp; AND PUBLIC SAFETY</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question 1 has been withdrawn.</p>
		    <p class="H4StageHeading">Cheap Alcohol</p>
		    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr K  Robinson </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  when he next intends to meet with representatives of the main supermarkets  about the availability of cheap alcohol.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO482/09> (AQO  482/09)</a></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: Over the summer,  I met representatives of all the main supermarkets &mdash; including Tesco, Asda and  Sainsbury&rsquo;s &mdash; and I am encouraged by the work that they are undertaking on the  issues relating to alcohol misuse and underage drinking. However, more remains  to be done. I am keen to meet key representatives from the alcohol and drinks  industry again, in the near future, to see what further actions the industry  can take to deal with those issues, particularly in relation to access,  availability and price.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  I commend the Minister on his two recent, positive announcements; namely, the  abolition of prescription charges and the modernisation of the ambulance fleet.  Perhaps the Minister would now like to get his hat-trick by tackling the issue  of alcohol abuse. Will the Minister join me in welcoming the pilot scheme that  Sainsbury&rsquo;s has &mdash; in response to the Minister&rsquo;s direct engagement &mdash; introduced  today, which I believe is being rolled out across Northern Ireland? Will the  Minister consider the issue of supermarkets and price controls in particular?  That situation is completely unacceptable at the moment, because a tin of beer  costs 24p in some areas, while a bottle of water can cost more than &pound;1.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I welcome the Sainsbury&rsquo;s  initiative, which is a step in the right direction. During the summer, I met  with Justin King, the chief executive of Sainsbury&rsquo;s, as part of my engagement  with supermarkets on what I consider to be the three key issues &mdash; availability,  access and, in particular, price.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As a result of the new initiative, Sainsbury&rsquo;s now label  alcohol products to show, for example, the number of units of alcohol in each  drink. The label also provides other information that people understand, such  as the daily recommended unit intake. Therefore, when people buy or consume  alcohol, they will know exactly how much of it they will be able to take. As  Members know, one of the problems that exist here is that three quarters of the  adult population consume alcohol, and an alarming number of those people binge  drink; that is, drink unsafely. It is important that when people choose their  tipple &mdash; whatever it may be &mdash; they understand its alcoholic strength and can,  therefore, compute the damage that it will do.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his comments and his response. Challenge 25 is one  initiative that some companies have introduced &mdash; Asda, for example. According  to that scheme, someone buying alcohol must appear to be, or be able to prove  that he or she is, 25 years of age or more. Many people consider that to be a  worthwhile scheme because it prevents anyone who looks younger than 25 from  buying alcohol. It is especially important in the light of the fact that it is  possible to buy four tins of beer for &pound;1 in some stores. That price indicates  how easy alcohol is to obtain and that, therefore, some kind of scheme is  needed. Given that, will the Minister state his opinion of Challenge 25?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I agree with the Member&rsquo;s point,  although I assume that he is talking about Challenge 21.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  The Asda scheme is Challenge 25.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s point is important.  The issue is about age at point of sale and ensuring that alcohol does not  reach people who it should not &mdash; that is, the younger generation &mdash; although the  fact is that they appear to be able to access alcohol routinely. Ken Robinson  raised an important point about the price of alcohol. The fact is that most  children who receive pocket money can afford to consume alcohol, even to the  point where they are falling down.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A couple of weeks ago, I was out with the Ambulance Service  and I have, therefore, personally experienced the situation that exists in the  university area and at the Odyssey Arena. Anyone who saw the UTV and BBC news  reports will know that pictures do not tell lies and that those reports showed  many empty bottles scattered around the Odyssey Arena, coupled with many young  people milling around at approximately 2.30 am.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I personally witnessed a number of fights when I was at the  Odyssey complex. Furthermore, on that same night, a drunken young person  leaving Queen&rsquo;s University students&rsquo; union walked out in front of a car.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Those are graphic examples witnessed by me on just one  night. Those types of incidents are routinely faced by Health Service and  accident and emergency staff in ambulances and in hospitals. However, that is  only part of the problem of alcohol. The other part is the long-term physical  and mental damage being done to our population.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  There is a sense of market failure when people seem to be more readily able to  go out drinking than indulging in other leisure activities. Can the Minister  tell the House what representations his Department has made to the Treasury  with respect to a UK-wide strategy to address the pricing of alcohol?  Furthermore, what discussions has the Minister had with other Departments &mdash; for  example, the Department for Social Development &mdash; in relation to licensing  policy in Northern Ireland?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The Department for Social  Development (DSD) is currently undertaking a review of licensing policy. That  Department is responsible for how licences are awarded, licensing hours et  cetera. My Department has a drugs and alcohol strategy, on which all Departments  have been consulted. Furthermore, I am currently developing a young people&rsquo;s  drinking action plan that will be released shortly. Again, there has been  consultation on that.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The pricing of alcohol is a Treasury matter. Arguments have  been made time and again on that issue. However, the big supermarkets do not  generally sell alcohol to persons under 18. Indeed, there have only been three  or four prosecutions made against the supermarkets in the UK in recent  years. They are very successful in policing their customers.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, they do sell alcohol at very low prices that the  average publican in Northern    Ireland cannot afford to match. That  highlights the issue of young people drinking in the home before they go out to  enjoy a night out.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">That is one issue. There is also the issue of young people  being able to access alcohol, and there is the issue of availability. Those are  all issues that Margaret Ritchie can examine and they are all issues that  result from our present licensing laws, which, in my view, are far too liberal.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Questions 3 and 4 have been withdrawn.</p>
		    <p class="H5StageHeading">Heart Disease/Poor Dental Care</p>
		    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mr  O&rsquo;Dowd </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety if  his Department is investigating links between heart disease and poor dental  care. <a name=AQO475/09>(AQO 475/09)</a></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The Department of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety does not undertake research. However, the Department  has, through the research and development office, recently funded research into  the link between periodontal gum disease and coronary heart disease and  strokes. The research is being undertaken by Professor Gerry Linden at the  Queen&rsquo;s University school of dentistry.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">That research project will take five years to complete and  its results will not be known until 2011. At present, there is no strong  evidence to suggest that gum disease causes heart disease.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  The Minister will be aware that there is a correlation between poor dental  health and deprivation, and between deprivation and general ill health and,  indeed, heart disease. As the report will take five years to complete &mdash; I  assume to allow the researchers to monitor health across that period &mdash; will  there be an interim reporting measure? That would mean that if a correlation  between gum disease and heart disease is discovered earlier than 2011, a  mechanism will be in place to report back to the Department.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I can arrange for that to be in  place and I will ensure that it happens. However, there is a distinction  between gum disease and oral health, which refers to dental health. Northern Ireland has poor dental health, but our  record on gum disease is no worse than any other part of the UK.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, there is no cause and effect between gum  disease and heart disease and strokes. There is an association, and we are  trying to determine whether that association can be proved as a cause and  effect. For example, one of the primary contributory factors to heart disease  is smoking, and that is also the case with gum disease. Ergo, can we say that  smoking causes poor gum disease or that gum disease causes heart disease? That  is the step that we are not in a position to take at the moment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There are other common risk factors, and they will be  determined by the research. I am happy to report to the Assembly as we proceed.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  Given the high level of heart disease and poor dental care in Northern Ireland,  does the Minister agree that the role of the new public health agency will be  to tackle those and other important health issues? Is it not, therefore,  critical that a stand-alone public health agency is established? Furthermore,  does he agree that any attempt to dilute the role of public health in the new  structures will be seen as defeatist and narrow-minded?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I agree with the sentiments  behind the Member&rsquo;s comments. The strategy for health states that we must have  investment, be efficient, and engage the local population in their own health.  That, uniquely, is where the public health agency will be instrumental. It will  address such areas as alcohol &mdash; that I mentioned previously &mdash; and its  associated risks, such as poor mental and physical health and teenage  pregnancies. The public health agency will also address the need to get  messages and support into the areas of disadvantage where one is more likely to  die younger than one&rsquo;s counterparts who live in more affluent areas. In  carrying out those roles, the public health agency will work closely with local  government &mdash; one of the key deliverers in the process. It is for that reason  that I received unanimous support from the Executive at one of their, what are  now rare, meetings for the proposed public health agency model.</p>
		    <p class="H5StageHeading">Acute Hospital: South-West</p>
		    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">6. <strong>Mr  Elliott </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety for  an update on the new acute hospital for the South West.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO485/09> (AQO 485/09)</a></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Recently, I announced the  Northern Ireland Health Group as the successful tenderer for the development of  the new acute hospital in the south-west. The project will be the first Health  Service development of its size to be procured through the private-finance  initiative, and it represents the best value for money for the taxpayer.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The major investment will provide the people of the  south-west with a modern, state-of-the-art healthcare facility that will be fit  for the twenty-first century. Delivery of the new hospital is on schedule for  2012.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I commend the Minister on the recent announcement that a successful tenderer  has been appointed for the acute services hospital in the south-west. Does the  Minister agree that now is the time for everyone to get behind the projects in  the south-west? Furthermore, does he agree that now is the time for Omagh  District Council to join the liaison group to ensure that the building of the  new enhanced hospital in Omagh can proceed?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I agree with that, and I commend  the unanimous &mdash; and expected &mdash; support afforded to the investment from  Fermanagh District Council. The investment of some &pound;260 million in Enniskillen,  at a time of recession and when the construction industry is in poor shape and  reporting major redundancies, is important.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, I cannot report the same tale about Omagh,  where the proposal is in the teeth of unstinting opposition from Omagh District  Council. It is a matter for Omagh district councillors to determine whether the  town wants the investment to be made. I have serious decisions to make around  capital priorities, and, in light of Omagh District Council&rsquo;s adamant and  steadfast refusal to support the project, it is difficult for me to proceed. I  have set up a steering group that will permit all bodies &mdash; including Omagh  District Council &mdash; to get involved, determine the services that will go into  the local enhanced hospital and that will allow the building to commence.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The issue is becoming extremely urgent because of the  capital priorities and the review that I have conducted into them and, not  least, the time frames under which we operate.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  I do not turn a blind eye to investment in the west; I welcome any investment  that comes there. Is the Minister aware of the growing concern among senior  medical staff and consultants at Tyrone  County Hospital  in Omagh and at Erne   Hospital in Enniskillen  that the new flagship project will become &mdash; in their words &mdash; a white elephant?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Is he also aware that they have requested an urgent meeting  with the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety to highlight  those concerns and their growing anxiety at the declining service delivery in  the area? What action does the Minister propose to take to ensure that those  concerns are addressed and that acute services will continue to be delivered in  Omagh and Enniskillen? Will he give a guarantee to the House that that flagship  project will be sustainable?</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Minister, pick any question or all of them.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I can do no more than reiterate  what I have just said. The hospital at Enniskillen is going ahead with the full  support of the medical and nursing profession, trade unions and &mdash; not least and  most importantly &mdash; the local community as represented by the local council.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I cannot say the same for Omagh. As far as I can see, Omagh  District Council has put every obstacle in the way. I have been in post for 18 months  and during that time the Department has taken several steps to reassure people  in Omagh. Nevertheless, there has been a campaign of downright opposition &mdash; no  matter what I do. Mr Buchanan talks about acute services in Omagh when he knows  that the new acute hospital is going to Enniskillen. He is fighting an old  battle. If Mr Buchanan does not want the hospital, that is fine. I know of  other areas that require the investment. An investment of &pound;190 million would be  the biggest that Omagh has ever seen. However, I am getting absolute opposition  from Omagh District Council. Frankly, that is not sustainable. If the project  is getting that sort of opposition before it is started, where will we be if  and when we go ahead?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  I welcome the good news, and I assure the Minister that people in Fermanagh are  encouraged to hear about the hospital. People from the Omagh area are also  encouraged about it.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister confirm that the model Developing Better  Services is being used for delivering services at the new hospitals? Has his  Department any means of monitoring what is going on in the Western Health and  Social Care Trust so that when the new hospitals are in place the services will  be available and that nothing that has been planned to be delivered at Omagh or  Enniskillen will be whittled away in favour of Altnagelvin Hospital?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I confirm that the Department is  working to the model Delivering Better Services, which determines, to a large extent,  what services will be in the new hospitals. For example, Enniskillen will have  a full range of hospital services including 24/7 accident and emergency;  inpatient services, including medicine surgery, paediatrics, obstetrics,  gynaecology and critical care; day-case surgery; diagnostics; and a  comprehensive range of outpatient services &mdash; the full range to be expected in  an acute hospital.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">An enhanced local hospital has been planned for Omagh &mdash;  which Omagh District Council does not need. Mr Gallagher said that people in  Omagh are encouraged: they need to tell their councillors that, so that the  councillors can tell me that they are encouraged. Nevertheless, a full range of  services has been planned for Omagh, including a 24/7 urgent care and treatment  centre; outpatient services; diagnostics; day procedures; day-case surgery;  ambulatory-care services; an acute inpatient mental-health facility; a new  health and care centre; and full renal services. The hospital will provide  between 70% and 80% of all of the Omagh population&rsquo;s hospital needs &mdash; and I am  being told not to build it.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I had hoped that the Minister  would strike a more reconciliatory tone about the community in Omagh, which is  standing up for its rights for a proper health service. Will the Minister  respond positively to my invitation as an MLA for West Tyrone &mdash; and I hope that  I will have the support of other MLAs, including Mr Buchanan &mdash; to come to Omagh  in October as a matter of urgency and put his money where his mouth is and meet  local MLAs, the hospital campaign steering executive in Omagh and  representatives from Omagh District Council?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I have been to Omagh on more  than one occasion and done all that Mr McElduff has asked me to do.</p>
		    <p class="H5StageHeading">Ambulances in the North-West</p>
		    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">7. <strong>Mr D  Bradley </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety for  his assessment of the incident where an ambulance has broken down, while on an  emergency call, for the second time in two weeks in the North West region. <a name=AQO494/09>(AQO 494/09)</a></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I have received the Northern  Ireland Ambulance Services Trust&rsquo;s full report on the matter. The causes of the  two breakdowns were unrelated. The ambulance that broke down has been serviced  regularly, and its last routine service was carried out in February 2008. The  Northern Ireland Ambulance Services Trust confirmed that there was no impact on  the safety of the patients or crew on either occasion. Both times, a  replacement ambulance was on the scene quickly to transport the patients that  were involved to their destinations.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Last week, I announced a major investment package for the  Ambulance Service totalling almost &pound;100 million over the next 10 years,  including &pound;17&middot;4 million over the current comprehensive spending review (CSR)  period. That significant investment will allow the service to modernise its  estate and replace its fleet and equipment on a regular basis.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. F&aacute;ilt&iacute;m cinnte roimh an  infheist&iacute;ocht a d&rsquo;fh&oacute;gair an tAire an tseachtain seo caite sa tseirbh&iacute;s  otharchairr.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the investment in the Ambulance Service that the  Minister announced last week. However, given that the fleet is ageing and there  are new shift proposals, what will happen in the interim? For example, in my  constituency of Newry and Armagh, Newry will lose three eight-hour shifts on  Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays, and there will be similar losses in the Armagh City  and District Council area. The matter is literally one of life and death and  has huge repercussions for many communities.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. This is Question Time, Mr Bradley. We do not need a  statement after the question. I ask you to put your question to the Minister so  that other Members have an opportunity to ask their questions.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  I am in the process of asking my question. You allowed other Members much more  latitude when they were asking questions.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:  Order. Your asking a question has been an elongated process, and I ask you to  shorten it.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  I will take my lead from the time that was allowed for other Members.<span class="Italic"> [Laughter.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As I was saying, the matter is too serious for Members to  be laughing.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. I ask the Minister to respond to the question.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The investment that I announced  last week &mdash; &pound;100 million over the next 10 years including &pound;17&middot;4 million over  the three-year CSR period &mdash; will facilitate full capital replacement in the  Ambulance Service. The investment will allow me to replace the entire ambulance  fleet over the next five years, and that will happen regularly.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Parts of the ambulance fleet that I inherited have aged  considerably. Those ambulances continue to do the job that they are required to  do, their servicing is second to none, and they are extremely well looked  after. Everyone will remember the incidence of two breakdowns because they are  such rare events. The investment in running costs is far above the level of  inflation, and investment in capital will also increase. The needs of the  Ambulance Service will be in good stead in the foreseeable future because of  that investment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Indeed, the number of planned hours of ambulance cover in Northern Ireland  will rise considerably over the next three years &mdash; from the current 538,000  hours per annum to 600,000 hours per annum. The investment in resources will  rise from &pound;46&middot;6 million to &pound;57 million. We will buy 60 accident-and-emergency  ambulances, 60 patient-care vehicles and 26 rapid-response vehicles, in  addition to the satellite-navigation systems, geographic-information systems  and digital-mapping systems that I have mentioned previously. All of that will  make the Ambulance Service more efficient.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not anticipate any reduction in staff numbers: there  are currently 1,076 staff, and there will be 1,076 staff three years from now.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I am grateful to the Minister for his answer. I warmly commend and congratulate  him on yet another positive announcement &mdash; the second in one week. Such  announcements clearly demonstrate yet again that, whatever the other parties in  the House might be at, the Ulster Unionist Party is delivering for the people  of Northern Ireland,  and it will continue to do so.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">What steps has the Minister taken to improve ambulance  response times across Northern    Ireland?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I thank Mr Kennedy for those  remarks. As far as ambulance response times are concerned, 70% of all  life-threatening calls must be responded to within eight minutes, and we are on  target in that respect. From April 2009, that figure will increase to 75% of  all calls. We must bear in mind that, each year, the Ambulance Service receives  a total of 125,000 emergency calls, and 253,000 non-emergency calls &mdash; that  gives some idea of the sheer volume of business with which the organisation  deals.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I welcome last week&rsquo;s announce&shy;ment about the investment in new ambulances.  Does the Minister agree that the majority of ambulances that are currently  being used are probably clapped out and in need of urgent repair? It is only  for the grace of God, and the skill of the Ambulance Service&rsquo;s maintenance  department, that there have not been more incidents like those that occurred  last week.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I do not agree that the  ambulances are clapped out. They are very well maintained and looked after,  and, as I said, we all remember the two breakdowns because they are rare  events. However, I agree that the fleet is too old, which is why I have  invested money in changing the entire fleet over the next five years.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind all Members that Question Time is an opportunity for  Members to ask questions &mdash; not to make statements.</p>
		    <p class="H5StageHeading">Middletown  Centre for Autism</p>
		    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">8. <strong>Mr  McCallister </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  how many meetings have taken place between the Southern Health and Social Care Trust  and the management of the Middletown Centre for Autism.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO480/09>(AQO 480/09)</a></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Senior Southern Health and  Social Care Trust staff met individual staff at the Middletown Centre for  Autism on two occasions: 26 November 2007 and 21 February 2008. Both meetings  were held at the request of the centre. Those were informal meetings during  which staff talked about the way in which the centre was likely to operate. No  further discussions have taken place on the specific health and social care  services that the Middletown  centre expects the health trust to provide.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I, too, congratulate the Minister on his announcements about the Ambulance  Service and prescription charges &mdash; both are good news for patients.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister will be aware of my concerns &mdash; and, indeed,  the concerns of many &mdash; about the plans for the autism centre at Middletown. Does he share  my disbelief that the Minister of Education has ploughed ahead with those plans  despite the fact that Middletown  is miles from the nearest acute setting? Is it not a disgrace that the Minister  is attempting to play politics with the issue? I know that the Minister has  concerns about the project, so will he raise the matter urgently with the  Minister of Education?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: As Mr McCallister pointed out,  the Middletown  centre is entirely a matter for the Department of Education, and it would not  be proper for me to give my opinion on it. However, I can say that I  commissioned a report on autism, and that the independent review team that was  established has produced an action plan, which has now been put out for  consultation. The key issues are: earlier detection and recognition; assessment  and diagnosis; appropriate and timely intervention; and support for individuals  and families.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have also allocated an extra &pound;2&middot;02 million, on top of the  Budget allocation, specifically for autism because it has not had the serious  attention that it deserves. As far as Middletown Centre for Autism is  concerned, my Department has never been involved in discussions on details of  medical provision.</p>

		    <p class="H5StageHeading">Organic Farming</p>
		    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mr  Molloy </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development to provide a  breakdown of the funding available to the different land types for organic  farming in the rural development programme.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO455/09> (AQO 455/09)</a></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development (Ms Gildernew)</strong>: Organic farming is funded  under two different schemes in the rural development programme.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The organic farming scheme (OFS) is available to farmers  who are in the process of converting their land to organic production. Payments  are made over five years, totalling &pound;470 per hectare for improved and semi-improved  grassland; &pound;570 per hectare for arable land; and &pound;670 per hectare for  horticultural land. Under EU rules, payment can be made only to compensate for  income foregone or losses incurred in converting to organic production. Most  unimproved land, such as heather moorland, does not receive significant input  to fertiliser or pesticide applications, so converting that land to organic  management incurs no additional cost or income reduction when compared with  conventional approaches. For that reason, no payment is made for unimproved  land in the OFS.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Funding is also available to organic farmers entering the  new countryside management scheme who fully converted organic land under  agreement. Improved and semi-improved land in the scheme will receive a payment  of &pound;30 per hectare per year.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. What is the role of the organic action plan group, and  will it be restructured?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: The organic action plan group, which is  made up of a wide range of representatives from the organic sector, was  consulted in relation to the design of the organic farming scheme. The group  provided guidance to my Department, inclusive of all aspects of the organic  sector. The current group&rsquo;s term ends in December 2008, and my Department will  consider how future development of the sector should be progressed.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>:  What assessments or research have been carried out on farms to establish a fair  payment for different land types? How many organic farmers who farm land that  is categorised as unimproved serve on Northern Ireland&rsquo;s organic action  plan group?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I do not have the information on the  second part of the Member&rsquo;s question, but I will provide it to him in writing.  However, the organic action plan group was involved, and there was a wide range  of consultation on the organic farming scheme.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  I thought that question 1 might have been withdrawn, in view of the fact that  the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development was told last week that the  Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) had withdrawn finances  from farmers who are working on unimproved land. In view of the Minister&rsquo;s  support for organic production, will she now reinstate that money to those  farmers?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: The difficulty about that issue is that  an EU regulation was introduced that governed grants under the previous scheme.  That was replaced in 2005 by a new regulation, the terms of which were  considerably stricter. Under the previous regulation, member states were  allowed to include small incentives to encourage organic farming. However, the  new regulation does not allow any incentive element in the payment calculation.  No economic data were available to justify any payment for unimproved land on  the only basis available &mdash; that is, additional costs incurred or income  foregone. If new evidence shows significant income foregone or costs incurred  in converting unimproved land from conventional to organic management, the  Department will review the scheme&rsquo;s payment structures at the 2010 mid-term  review of the rural development programme.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question 2 has been withdrawn.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Bluetongue</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Mr  Bresland </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development what  action she is taking to prevent the spread of bluetongue.<a name=AQO415/09>(AQO 415/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Bluetongue emerged in northern Europe in  August 2006 and in England  in September 2007. This year, the disease has re-emerged in much of northern Europe. In view of the risk to our livestock industry,  all susceptible animals imported from outside this island continue to be  isolated, housed and restricted on the farm of destination. The animals are  post-import tested twice, and restrictions are lifted only when the Department  is satisfied that they do not present a bluetongue risk. In recent weeks, at  least seven separate consignments of imports from the Continent to England and Wales have contained bluetongue-infected  animals.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As a result, I re-emphasised my message to the industry  that it must consider carefully the risks before importing. Everyone involved  must consider the possible cost to their own businesses and to the wider  industry of importing bluetongue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My officials have been working with Merial, the vaccine  manufacturer, to supply almost two million doses of vaccine as part of our  contingency plan. That vaccine will be available shortly. However, under EU  rules, vaccine can only be used in an area that is part of a protection zone. I  reiterate that it is essential that farmers do not become complacent. The best  preventive measure is to not purchase animals that may have been exposed to the  bluetongue virus. I am pleased that, to date, the industry has heeded my  appeals not to import livestock from high-risk areas.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bresland</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her response. Will she outline her policy in the event  of an outbreak of bluetongue in the Republic  of Ireland, and will she confirm that  in the event of such an outbreak she will adopt a fortress-Northern Ireland  strategy?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: The disease is borne by midges, which do  not have any respect for borders, so it would depend on where the outbreak  occurs. If an outbreak occurred in Cork,  for example, and the protection zone was limited so that it effectively cut the  island in half, we might either decide to remain a free area or consider a  means to extend that protection zone to cover the North and allow us to vaccinate.  That would require an assessment of the relative risks and benefits.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the event of an outbreak in which the protection zone  extends to the border, we might very well decide to extend the protection zone  into the North to allow us to vaccinate. However, no decisions can be taken  prior to the facts of an outbreak being known. Furthermore, factors such as the  time of year will have an impact on the veterinary risk assessment and the  Department&rsquo;s decision. Obviously, we have a contingency plan for that scenario.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  What information has the Department provided to farmers and the farming unions  NIAPA (Northern Ireland Agricultural Producers&rsquo; Association) and the Ulster  Farmers&rsquo; Union?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: For more than a year, my Department has  been working in partnership with the key stakeholders, including both farmers&rsquo;  unions, through the bluetongue working group. That group has discussed  preparedness to deal with the threat of bluetongue and will continue to do so.  In conjunction with key stakeholders, the Department has also provided advice  to the industry about bluetongue, including information about clinical signs.  Leaflets are available, and the information is also on the DARD website. The  Department has also issued advice to local importers, highlighting the  potential risks of importing susceptible animals from bluetongue-infected  areas, and the measures that those importers must take if they move livestock  to shows in Britain.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have stressed repeatedly to the industry here that the  best preventive measure is not to purchase animals from high-risk areas. There  is absolutely no room for complacency. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I wish the Minister well with her imminent new delivery. I hope that it is not  too imminent. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">How much has the Department of Agriculture and Rural  Development spent on the bluetongue vaccine to date?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: The Department has submitted a bid for  1&middot;9 million doses of vaccine. I do not have the figures to hand, but I will be  happy to forward information about the cost of the vaccines to the Member. We  had to make a managed risk assessment on whether to buy vaccine in advance or  to stockpile it. However, the vaccine has a limited shelf life, as I have  previously explained in the House. We have purchased a number of doses of  vaccine, but we have not yet received them; they will not be available until  late October or November. The contingency plan was put in place so that we are  prepared for anything.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Member for his comments. If it happens today,  it is good to know that the Member will be on hand to give me a wee shove out. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. The Member will be on his own. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Question 4 has been withdrawn.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">DARD Direct</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mr  Hamilton </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development what  consideration her Department has given to the siting of a new DARD Direct  office in the Ards/North Down area. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO397/09> (AQO  397/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">DARD Connect</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">9. <strong>Mr  McCarthy </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development for an  update on office closures under the DARD Connect scheme. &nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO450/09> (AQO 450/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: With your permission, Mr Deputy Speaker,  I will answer questions 5 and 9 together.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">DARD Direct is a new service delivery method aimed at  improving the quality of service that the Department provides to its customers.  A pilot of DARD Direct was set up in Enniskeen House in Enniskillen; an  independent evaluation of the pilot was positive, and customer feedback was  very good. Based on that positive feedback, I have agreed that the model should  be rolled out across the North.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The proposed roll-out of DARD Direct is undergoing an  equality impact assessment (EQIA). Officials from my Department carried out the  public consultation phase during the summer. The key issues arising from that  were accessibility of offices, for both staff and customers; quality and  flexibility of service; and disruption to staff and customers. We are in the process  of preparing a final EQIA report, which includes the findings of that  consultation exercise and appropriate recommendations for mitigating actions  for the emerging issues. The final EQIA report is scheduled to be discussed by  the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development in the first week of  December.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">No decisions on the final number and locations of DARD  Direct offices will be taken until after that report has been fully considered.  Given that situation, I cannot provide any specific information in relation to  the siting of a new office in the Ards or north Down area at present.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s confirmation that no final decision has been taken in  respect of siting. However, given that north Down and Ards are significant agricultural  areas, and that the area in particular around Comber and Newtownards is known  as the &ldquo;market garden of Ulster&rdquo;, does she agree with me that it would be  unforgivable and unacceptable not to site a DARD office in that area,  particularly given that it is well-served by DARD offices in Newtownards?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I do not want to pre-empt the outcome of  that report; it would be more unforgivable of me to make a recommendation or  decision when I do not have all the information available to me. I will  carefully scrutinise all the reports that are received. Comments have been very  positive, and I want to take cognisance of everything before I make a final  decision.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  In view of the Minister&rsquo;s response to last week&rsquo;s announcement about the  relocation of Civil Service jobs &mdash; when she supported the location of jobs in  the rural community &mdash; would it not be a bit contradictory if, at the end of the  consultation process, the Minister were to agree to relocate away from Ards,  which is in a rural constituency?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Professor Bain&rsquo;s report recommends that  public-sector jobs should be located where they can best enhance the  sustainable economic and social development of the North. That review was com&shy;missioned  by the Executive, so any recommendations will have to be examined carefully  before Ministers make any decision on how best to proceed. However, enhanced  service delivery and improved access for customers and stakeholders are key  outcomes of the proposed approach. That is exactly what I hope to achieve with  the roll-out of DARD Direct, and my officials will take into consideration the  decisions made on the Bain Review when they are known.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>:  Will the Minister indicate some of the main issues that arose from the  consultation on this matter?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: The consensus from those responding was  very supportive of the concept of DARD Direct, and a number of main issues  arose. The issue of accessibility for both customers and staff was mentioned,  although, from a customer perspective, the number of offices is less important  than the provision of good coverage and a more joined-up approach to delivery,  with competent, knowledgeable and professional front-line staff. There is also  a need for adequate accessible customer parking, and for the offices to be at a  reasonable travelling distance. The office design must be customer-friendly,  staff-friendly, disabled-friendly and child-friendly, and public transport  links should be considered when identifying locations.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Also mentioned was flexibility of service delivery.  Flexible service provision in relation to opening hours was requested by  customer groups, and although nine-to-five opening is welcome, the need for  out-of-hours opening should be assessed at each location. Alternative channels  of service delivery must be well-promoted, and appropriate training could  increase the uptake of online services. There is also the issue of the quality  of service delivery; it is very important to maintain good relationships  between customers and staff and high levels of customer service.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The issue of disruption to staff was also mentioned,  particularly the potential impact of relocating staff to new offices. It is  important to note that that would have a greater effect on administration  grades, and that female staff make up the greater percentage of non-mobile  administrative assistants, administrative officers and part-time staff, and are  also likely to have dependants and caring responsibilities. All of that will be  taken into consideration when making a final decision.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  I want to ask the Minister about accessibility, which is a very important  issue. Does she understand that the accessibility criteria are Northern  Ireland-wide, and if they are applied, there will be considerable areas of  north and south Fermanagh that will fall outside those criteria? It is,  therefore, very important for her Department to carefully consider Fermanagh.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister put her plans to move many of her  Department&rsquo;s offices to Omagh on hold while the Bain Report is being  considered?</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: No final decision on the Department&rsquo;s  location has been made, so the reference to Omagh is very premature. Also,  Inniskeen House, which was the initial pilot project that opened about three  years ago, has been hugely successful. We are working closely with the focus  group in Fermanagh on how they feel about the project, and those who live  closer to Omagh are travelling to Fermanagh because there is a wider range of  services at Inniskeen House.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We have examined accessibility issues carefully, and I am  all too aware of them, particularly in south and west Fermanagh. Good decisions  must be made that reflect where people live and how they do business. However,  the comments about Inniskeen House, in general, are hugely supportive and very  encouraging, and I am happy with how that project is progressing.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question 6 has been withdrawn.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Countryside Management Scheme</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">7. <strong>Mr  Gardiner </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development the time  frame for new applicants to be approved into the Countryside Management Scheme  and to allow associated work to commence on-farm.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO435/09> (AQO 435/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: The new countryside management scheme  agreements for successful applicants between 30 June and 29 August will  commence on 1 January 2009. Farmers can commence works in the scheme once their  agreement has received approval. It is important to note that no one should  commence any works under a countryside management scheme unless he or she has  received, signed and returned the agreements and received confirmation that  they have been approved. During the application period, 4,430 eligible  applications were received.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  Due to the payment rates differential, has the Minister made any plans to  review the payment rates for those farmers who are engaged in work from  previous countryside management schemes. Also, will she review payments in the  scheme in future years?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: The issue of payment rates is something  that we have had to consider. We accept that there is a different ratio this  time and that farmers who enter the new countryside management scheme will be  asked to deliver more environmental benefits. Therefore, many farmers who are  in the old scheme are content to stay at that level of compliance and are not  interested with more involvement. However, we must also manage the situation;  there have been over 4,000 applications, and we want to see the best possible  environmental impact, so we will have to manage how we roll those out over a  period of time. Although we have thought about it, it is not practical for us  to review payment rates mid way, and we want to get more people into the scheme  as soon as possible. Therefore, the issue is management of human and financial  resources in the Department.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr W McCrea</strong>:  How many of the 4,430 applications are successful, because it has been  acknowledged that not all who have applied will be admitted to the scheme? Why  do we have to wait until 1 January 2009 before successful countryside  management scheme agreements for this application period will commence?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Due to EU regulations, all claims for  payment in the new scheme must be made using the integrated administrations and  control system (IACS) single application form, which must normally be submitted  by May each year. Following validation and eligibility checks, payments will be  issued on or around completion of the scheme year, which runs from 1 January  until 31 December. Due to the high level of interest, and to maximise  environmental benefit, we must also give priority to farmers who have land in  special areas of conservation, special protection areas, areas of special  scientific interest, Ramsar areas, geopark areas and environmentally sensitive  areas. We will try to manage admissions to the scheme as best we can to ensure  that we get a good outcome from the countryside management scheme.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Doherty</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her answer. Will all the applicants receive a farm  visit and be offered an agreement?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Unfortunately, not all farmers will  receive a visit &mdash; certainly, not during the first round. Applicants will be  visited according to environmental priorities and budgetary constraints that  have been identified for the new countryside management scheme.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department anticipates that it will carry out 1,300  farm visits to enable successful applicants to commence their agreements for  the claim year from 1 January to 31 December 2009. As I said, those visits will  concentrate on applicants whose sites have been designated as having special  environmental importance. The Department&rsquo;s target in 2008 is to reach  approximately 1,000 agreements, with approximately 2,000 entering the scheme in  the subsequent years of the rural development programme&rsquo;s duration.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  I am sure that &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The question number will suffice, Mr McNarry.</p>

	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">8. <strong>Mr  McNarry </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development what  progress has been made on the Better Regulation and Simplification Review.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO438/09> (AQO 438/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat. In November  2007, the former Environment Minister, Arlene Foster, and I launched the better  regulation and simplification review. Since then, work has progressed under the  direction of an independent panel, chaired by Mr Michael Dowling. The panel has  been active. It has met representatives from the industry and environmental  groups on various occasions to consider evidence from previous reviews and  studies. It has visited the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural  Affairs (DEFRA) to learn from its experience of better regulation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Officials who work with the panel have analysed current  DARD and Department of the Environment (DOE) regulations to identify where the  most significant burdens exist. A consultative exercise with stakeholders,  which aims to agree baseline estimates of the administrative burden and to  generate simplification proposals, is well advanced. The panel provided the  Environment Minister and me with an interim report at the end of May 2008. It  also presented the report to the Assembly&rsquo;s Agriculture and Rural Development  Committee and Environment Committee. It briefed both Committees on the review&rsquo;s  progress in June 2008.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In its interim report, the panel asked for more time to  complete its work because the exercise is more complex than had been  anticipated. The original expectation that estimates of administrative burden  and simplification proposals for England would provide most of the  information that was required proved not to be the case. As a result, officials  who support the panel have had to scrutinise legislation, identify the  administrative burden that it creates, estimate the time and cost of compliance  for business, and agree those estimates with stakeholders. The detailed  information generated by those baseline exercises has then been used to  identify the most burdensome regulations and activities, and is a starting  point for discussion of simplification proposals.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Agribusiness and environmental stakeholders were consulted  on the need to extend the project. They agreed that the additional time  required was fully justified by the importance of the exercise to the long-term  delivery of the better-regulation agenda. The review is now expected to be  completed by the end of 2008.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  I am grateful to the Minister for her detailed answer. I am sure that she is  reassured, as, indeed, all Members were &mdash; you included, Mr Deputy Speaker &mdash; by  the Health Minister&rsquo;s assurances on ambulances. I thought that we might have  needed to call one for the Minister had her answer been any longer.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">How will the review&rsquo;s final results be measured to ensure  that overall reduction of 25% in the cost of regulation will be achieved? Can  the Minister confirm that she has cut through red tape on that issue?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Obviously, the Department must await the  panel&rsquo;s recommendations. However, as the panel carries out its work, the  Department has done its best to improve simplification and to cut bureaucracy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For example, the countryside management scheme was  discussed, and applications for that scheme could be made by phone call. The  Department strives to make such processes much easier, and it wants to ensure  that whatever it introduces during the interim will have gone through the prism  to cut red tape and bureaucracy and to make matters easier for farmers.  Furthermore, the Department is also rolling out a pilot scheme in which farmers  can notify officials by phone of animals&rsquo; births and movements. Therefore,  people who, traditionally, would have had to send that information in writing  to the Department can now provide it over the phone. The Department is keen to  be as accessible and customer-friendly as possible to the farming community.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Irwin</strong>:  Does the Minister believe that the review&rsquo;s terms of reference are wide enough  to allow the panel to make any recommendations that will significantly reduce  red tape and bureaucracy?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: The terms of reference are certainly  wide enough. The fact that the panel has asked for additional time means that  it, too, has accepted that the terms are wide enough. It is a complex and  complicated process. The right people are in place to examine all those issues.  They have been given additional time. It is hoped, therefore, that they will  produce solid recommendations.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It has been difficult and a challenge. However, that will  not deter us from striving to achieve the targets that we have set.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question 9 was grouped with question 5 and has already been  answered.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Farm Diversification</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">10. <strong>Mr  McQuillan </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development how many  farmers have diversified from farming in the past three years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO406/09>(AQO 406/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: It is important to note that  diversification is not always about farmers moving out of farming, but rather  about providing the farmer and farm-family members with additional incomes that  can help to make the overall farm business more sustainable.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Not every farmer who wants to diversify necessarily  approaches my Department, but we encourage farmers and farm-family members to  engage with us. To help them, we have implemented several methods of helping  farm families to diversify and supported them with capital grants under various  funding programmes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">From April 2003 to March this year, 1,223 people have  completed the diversification challenge programme run by the College of Agriculture,  Food and Rural Enterprise (CAFRE). Some 295 of them are known to have started a  diversified farm business. Under the LEADER+ programme, 26 farm diversification  projects were able to draw down &pound;400,000 of EU funds. Axis 1 of the regional  development programme has farm-family options built into it, including  reskilling, which will help farm families to decide on an option for  diversifying &mdash; and what reskilling support they need &mdash; and provide them with  mentoring throughout the process.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Under axis 3, we have included a specific  farm-diversification measure, with &pound;20 million ring-fenced for farmers and  members of farm families who wish to diversify on-farm. They will also be  eligible to apply for funds under the micro-business creation and support measure  for off-farm diversification.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McQuillan</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her answer. What is the Minister&rsquo;s Department doing to  encourage diversification in the farming community, especially in East Londonderry?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: My Department encourages farmers to  diversify and to try to find ways to supplement their farm income. We have a  wide range of schemes. Axis 3 of the rural development programme will be widely  publicised, and we will ensure that not just the farmer, but members of the  farm family, know that that money is available to them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A tender process is under way to find a delivery agent for  axis 1. Over the next few months, Farm Family Options, including reskilling,  will open for calls. Work is progressing well on axis 3, and I hope that we  will be able to complete the strategies and enter into contracts for the  initial allocations of funding that have been previously announced, including  the farm-diversification measure. We are working hard to publicise the fact that  the programme is open and available and to encourage take-up.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When I am out and about, meeting people, I am encouraged to  see the wide range of diversification projects that have been set up across the  North. Some people have taken the skills that they have learned on the farm and  put them to use in innovative businesses. We have very creative and  entrepreneurial people in the rural community, and they are well placed to take  advantage of those grants.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brolly</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. When will this funding be  available to farmers?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I covered many aspects of that in my  answer to the previous question. It will all come on board over the next few  months. I look forward to that funding being rolled out across the North.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I am sure that, when the Minister is off for a few weeks of well-earned rest,  she will not miss her attendance at meetings of the Executive.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister accept that diversification should not  just be about diversification from farming, but should take place in  conjunction with ongoing farming activities?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Farm diversification is about providing  the farmer and farm-family members with additional incomes that will help to  make the overall farming business more sustainable and will, I hope, keep them  in farming. Diversification is not about alternatives to farming and getting  people off the land. Rather, it is a way of supplementing and enhancing the  farm business and ensuring that the farmer and farm-family members have a  better quality of life as a result.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: No one is more relieved than me that we got through that half hour  without incident, and without an increase of one in Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s membership in  the Chamber.</p>

	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Voluntary and Community Sector: Development</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mr  Bresland </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development to outline her strategy  for the future development of the voluntary and community sector.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO429/09>(AQO 429/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development (Ms Ritchie)</strong>: First, I wish to offer my condolences and  sympathy to the deputy First Minister on the death, earlier today, of his  mother.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have the highest regard for the work carried out by the  voluntary and community sector throughout Northern Ireland. My Department is  implementing a number of key strategies in support of the future development of  the voluntary and community sector. Those measures are as follows: I have  introduced the Charities Act (Northern Ireland)  2008, which represents a major change for the charities sector in Northern Ireland; for the first time, charities  will be regulated by the Charity Commission for Northern Ireland; and the  appointment of the new charity commissioners is under way.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Last year, I published &lsquo;Opening Doors&rsquo;, a strategy for the  delivery of voluntary advice services to the community. Later this autumn, I  intend to launch a public consultation on the location of voluntary advice  services to identify where services are best located and how provision of  services might be better regularised.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department is also developing a support-services  strategy to help to ensure that voluntary and community organisations have  access to support services to make their work more effective. It is likely that  the strategy will place a new emphasis on the commissioning of services under  contract. Ahead of full consultation later this year, I will introduce a new  volunteering strategy, the objective of which is to increase awareness and  levels of volunteering. That strategy will shortly go before the Committee for  Social Development.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The &lsquo;Positive Steps&rsquo; strategy, which is also  cross-departmental, is aimed at implementing a series of commitments arising  from the report of the task force on resourcing the sector. Good progress has  been made on the majority of actions, and my officials are working with the  Department of Finance and Personnel and the Northern Ireland Audit Office to  examine the more complex actions that remain outstanding.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, my Department published the Partners for Change  2006-08 strategy, which is aimed at supporting the voluntary and community  sector. That strategy has now run its course, and I have asked my officials to  examine options for future strategic support and development of the sector,  including a review of the compact.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bresland</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her response. Will she confirm what role the local  community fund will have within her Department&rsquo;s community development  strategy?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: As the Member will be aware, the local community fund  operates directly in many areas throughout Northern Ireland. This year and  last year, I was happy to launch and to support extensions to the local  community fund in areas where there are levels of disadvantage.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. In her support for the voluntary  and community sector, will the Minister explain why she has requested to  individually sign off on each neighbourhood renewal project in Belfast? Does she accept that such political  interference has the potential to put jobs and services at risk in areas of  multiple deprivation?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s point about political interference is  absolute rubbish, and I refute it.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: Given the pressure on funds across the Department, I  want to be sure that best use is being made of available resources. Therefore,  I have asked for some headline information on current neighbourhood renewal  applications, including the nature of project proposals, the neighbourhood  renewal area, and the funding requirements in the context of budgetary  resources.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I shall be absolutely clear: officials will make decisions  about funding individual projects and groups based on preset criteria. I again  emphasise that, as Minister, I will set the budget and the policy but &mdash; to  avoid any suggestion of political interference &mdash; I will take no part in  individual decisions. That constitutes political vetting and to do that would  be a contravention of the ministerial Pledge of Office, which I do not  countenance.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I note that the Member has tabled a series of questions to  various Ministers on the role of neighbourhood renewal, stating that there must  be buy-in. I welcome those types of questions, because they show that the  Member is seeking information from other Departments, which clearly emphasises  that she recognises that other Departments and other Ministers have a clear  role in delivering neighbourhood renewal.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Armstrong</strong>:  How much consultation has the Minister had with the Minister for the Third  Sector in Westminster?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I have corresponded with the Minister for the Third  Sector over the last year, but, as Members will appreciate, responsibility for  the voluntary and community sector within the Department for Social Development  lies with the Minister and the devolved institutions. I am happy to conduct  further discussions if I think that they are appropriate. Naturally, if the  Member wishes me to investigate a particular area, I will be happy to do so.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Housing Association Purchases</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Lord  Morrow </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development for her assessment of the  benefits of Housing Associations purchasing units directly from developers  outside of pre-planned schemes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO398/09> (AQO  398/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: My aim, first and foremost, is to deliver 5,250 new  social houses over the three-year period 2008-11. Plans have been put in place  to ensure that that will happen. The new housing agenda calls for innovative  ways in which to achieve best value for money. Where appropriate, the purchase  of units directly from developers at lower prices than in recent times allows  me to maximise the resources available to the social housing development  programme.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Traditionally, building new houses has been the most  cost-effective way of delivering social housing. However, due to the recent  change in the market, many houses that were previously beyond the financial  reach of housing associations have become available for purchase. If those  properties are in areas of greatest need, represent good value for money and  are design compliant, they can be included in the social-housing development  programme. However, establishing that there is a housing need in an area is a  prerequisite before approval can be given to any housing association to buy  houses directly from developers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The purchase of such units remains only a small percentage  of the overall programme. To further emphasise my commitment, I have already  embarked on several innovative partnerships that bring developers, lenders and  housing associations together in a unique way in order to help people to get  onto the first rung of the property ladder.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her comprehensive reply. Having listened to what she  has said, I wonder whether she has any concerns about that procedure. I want to  emphasise that I do not think that it is totally incorrect, but I certainly  have concerns about that procedure. It could be construed that those houses are  being purchased purely because they cannot be sold on the open market, and  maybe the Housing Executive and housing associations are good agencies to go to  go to get rid of them. Does the Minister have any concerns about that happening?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I understand the concerns outlined by the Member, but I  emphasise again that buying off the shelf can happen only in areas where there  is highest housing need, where the Housing Executive does not have locally available  land, where it represents good value for money, and where the properties are  design compliant. There are several conditions that have to be adhered to  before purchase takes place.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  In the light of increasing demand for social housing, has the Minister made  further representations to the Minister of Finance and Personnel for increased  funding? If so, what level of funding is she seeking?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I assure the Member that I have already done so. I made  a submission in the June monitoring round, and the Member will be aware that  very little money came out of that. I replicated the request through the  September monitoring round, which is currently being finalised by the Minister  of Finance and Personnel. I will be furnishing him with a further response  later today.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Naturally, that paper is due for discussion by the  Executive when they meet. With all due courtesy to my colleagues in the  Executive, I should discuss the details of that paper with them before I bring it  to the Chamber. I do not wish to be discourteous to anybody.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  Will the Minister commit to purchasing further off-the-shelf houses for social  housing and in so doing help local builders who are so hard pressed at the  moment?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I am prepared to consider all offers that come forward.  There will be a requirement for off-the-shelf purchases in every year of the  five year social housing development programme provided &mdash; and again I emphasise  the point &mdash; that they are in areas of highest need where the Housing Executive  does not have available land, represent good value for money, and are design  compliant. My priority is always to meet housing need at the right cost, and if  that helps builders at the same time, then it is a win-win situation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I sympathise with the plumbers, joiners, electricians,  bricklayers, and other construction workers whose employment is at risk in the  current downturn. However, it is worth remembering that although private-sector  house building has declined sharply, I am increasing public-sector house  building significantly. Hopefully, that will help builders all over Northern Ireland.  I have met with representatives of the construction industry on many occasions.  Coincidentally, a few weeks ago, other MLAs and I met with representatives of  the construction property group: they know that I am sympathetic to their  situation.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Fuel Poverty: Social Housing</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Mr  Neeson </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development when she will bring  forward proposals to assist people living in social housing who are most  vulnerable to fuel poverty.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO528/09> (AQO  528/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Fuel Poverty Task Force</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mrs  Hanna </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development for an update on the work  of the fuel poverty task force.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO513/09>(AQO  513/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Fuel Poverty</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mrs Long </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development what actions she is taking to  alleviate fuel poverty.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO527/09>(AQO  527/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: With the Deputy Speaker&rsquo;s permission, given the  similarity of questions 3, 4 and 5, I will respond to them together. Fuel  poverty is a cross-departmental issue. Earlier this year, I anticipated the  looming fuel-poverty crisis, and in May 2008 I established the fuel poverty  task force, which brought together representatives from Government and the  wider energy sector. The task force was asked to identify measures to tackle  fuel poverty and, in particular, to identify short-term recommendations that  could be developed to assist people who will be in need this winter.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I developed a set of practical proposals from the task  force&rsquo;s report, which were circulated to Ministers as a draft Executive paper  aimed at the meeting scheduled for 18 September. Unfortunately, that meeting  did not take place. Between that time and the next scheduled meeting of the  Executive, I received responses from a number of Ministers and had discussions  with the Minister of Finance and Personnel and the Minister of Health. Those  Ministers recognised the importance of the proposals as regards resource  requirements, the general implications for health, and the need to progress the  work urgently. When the Executive failed to meet yet again, I revised the  paper, taking into account other Ministers&rsquo; views, and produced a final  Executive paper, which I have sought clearance for via the urgent procedure  route.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I need clearance for the package, because although the  benefits of the proposals may not reach people until January 2009, the work &mdash;  including possible legislation &mdash; needs to start immediately. Obviously, the  package includes direct help for those most vulnerable to fuel poverty, but it  also includes a series of other actions aimed at bringing more resources to  bear on the problem. However, the issue merits a full response from the  Executive as a whole.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>:  Like the majority of Members, I share the Minister&rsquo;s frustration. It is an  absolute disgrace that decisions are not being taken because the Executive will  not meet. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span> Does the Minister agree  that because of the fuel hike thousands of people across Northern Ireland  are also suffering from frustration as a result of an Executive that will not  meet? <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I fully agree with Mr Neeson&rsquo;s comments: people will  ask why that is the case.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is absolutely time-critical that an Executive meeting  takes place in order that the urgent proposals to alleviate fuel poverty can be  discussed. Owing to the fact that an Executive meeting could not take place,  not to mention the matter&rsquo;s urgency &mdash; there is a compelling need to keep people  warm this winter &mdash; I immediately resubmitted my paper for urgent procedure.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>:  All Members share the Minister&rsquo;s concern. Is there anything in the Minister&rsquo;s  fuel-poverty package to help the working poor, who miss out because they are  just above benefits level?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: The full measures have yet to be discussed with my  Executive colleagues, so, with due courtesy to them, suffice it to say that  measures are contained in that package that would assist the working poor.  However, I emphasise again to Mrs Hanna that the matter is now time-critical,  and I hope that it can be approved through use of urgent procedure.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Notwithstanding all that, all my ministerial colleagues  should, and must, discuss the issues in that paper, because they have an impact  on various Departments. The Office of the First Minister and deputy First  Minister has responsibility for tackling poverty; the Department of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment has responsibility for energy prices and social tariffs;  my Department has responsibility for energy efficiency in the home; the  Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety has responsibility for  the health and well-being of all our citizens, and that includes those who are above  the benefits level &mdash; the working poor.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to get on with the work, and I hope that the  aspiration of everyone in the House is to ensure that people stay warm this  winter.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>:  Bearing in mind that recent increases in energy costs have led to expectations  that up to 43% of people in Northern Ireland could be vulnerable to fuel  poverty, does the Minister agree that tackling that issue could be top of the  agenda at any future Executive meeting, given that setting an agenda seems to  be difficult? That would allow the Executive to respond to this crisis with  more than hot air and heated comments.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I could not agree more with Mrs Long. I say yet again  that this is a time-critical issue, because the most important consideration is  delivering for people and ensuring that all the people of Northern Ireland  are kept warm this winter at a time when fuel prices have witnessed their  highest increases for many years.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  Does the Minister feel that the emergency procedure is an adequate way in which  to deal with the issue? Will she advise the House as to who is to blame for the  hold-up? Some of my constituents have asked me whether consideration has been  given to installing Watchman electronic oil-tank gauges in order to help the  elderly and vulnerable?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: Mr McCrea&rsquo;s questions raise several issues. Due to the  time-critical nature of the matter, and because Executive meetings did not take  place, I revised the paper to reflect comments that I had received from  Ministers across the four parties, and I submitted that revised version to the  First Minister and the deputy First Minister on Thursday evening.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I also had a discussion with the Minister of Finance and  Personnel, who recognises that substantial resources are required. I say, in  order to be helpful, that the final Executive paper does not impose a specific  amount of money, although the scheme that I have in mind will bring significant  assistance to many thousands of people. Delivering for people in order that  they can keep warm is paramount, because I am sure that the major issue raised  in all constituency offices is fuel poverty &mdash; how we work collectively to  alleviate it and how we deal with the issues that affect people daily.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Given that the more than 11,000  Housing Executive tenants who use the Economy 7 electric heating system will be  sorely hit by the rise in electricity prices, when will the Department for  Social Develop&shy;ment replace those systems with other heating systems?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I am aware of the concern that many people throughout Northern Ireland  have with Economy 7. I will investigate that issue directly with the Housing  Executive, and I will come back to Ms McCann in writing.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My officials are currently finalising changes to the warm  homes scheme, which is specifically dedicated to insulation measures. Those  changes will take account of the recent Northern Ireland Audit Office recom&shy;mendations,  and a consultation paper will be published later this month. The warm homes  scheme has been a huge success, and it has benefited approximately 65,000  households in Northern    Ireland to date. However, it has perhaps now  captured most of the quick wins, and it must be refocused so that the maximum  energy efficiency gains can be achieved and that the people who are most in  need of help get that help.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that some of Ms McCann&rsquo;s constituents who have  Economy 7 heating might benefit from the revised warm homes scheme. After the  revised scheme comes out for consultation, I hope that those people will  benefit from the implementation of the new scheme.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Purvis</strong>: I  know that the Minister is reviewing the criteria for the warm homes scheme.  However, the current criteria for the warm homes scheme excludes working  single-person households and other working households on low income that do not  qualify for passport benefits. Those households are the least-energy-efficient  homes, and 70% of them use oil as their only means of heating. What measures  does the Minister propose to alleviate fuel poverty for the working fuel poor?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: That issue was also raised by Mrs Hanna. The purpose of  refocusing the warm homes scheme is to ensure that the people who are most in  need, particularly the working poor, will have their requirements and needs  tackled. I ask Members to bide with me for a little longer. The consultation  paper will be published later this month. Members and their constituents will  have the opportunity to comment on that consultation paper, and I hope that the  combined comments will better inform the final production. The final outcome is  to keep people warm, and that is a longer-term measure than keeping people warm  this winter.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Questions 4 and 5 were grouped with question 3. Question 6 has  been withdrawn.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Laganside Community Activity Grants</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">7. <strong>Mr  McNarry </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development how many groups have  applied for Laganside community activity grants since 1 April 2007.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO421/09> (AQO 421/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: The aim of the Laganside community activity grant is to  support activities that are directly related to the Laganside area and that  address the needs of, and provide benefit to, the Laganside local community  from the rejuvenated river front. Since 1 April 2007, 44 groups have applied  for Laganside community activity grants.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her reply. I also congratulate her for her answers to  questions 3, 4 and 5; her tenacity was inspirational.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">What potential do the grants offer for the capacity of  local communities to build entrepreneurialism? What businesses have been  involved with events that are linked with the Laganside community activity  grant?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: Perhaps further background information will be helpful:  the total amount of grants expended in 2007-08 was &pound;11,638; and in this  financial year the figure is &pound;1,430 to date, with an estimated total for the  year of &pound;17,700. Last year, 19 groups applied for grants, and 25 groups have  applied so far in this financial year. The total number of applications is 48,  because several of the 44 groups made multiple applications for various  community activities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member asked about the different types of application.  Much potential exists for the local community in the Laganside area to benefit.  The activity grants provide the community with opportunities to express itself,  undertake activities that can help to regenerate the area and engage in  joined-up working, which I particularly welcome. Community activity also acts  as a fillip for tourism by attracting visitors to the Laganside area. As the  Member knows, my Department inherited responsibility for regeneration in the  area when it took over from the Laganside Development Corporation in April  2007.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  What further larger-scale regeneration around the river Lagan is being  considered? I am not alone in regretting the demise of the Laganside  Development Corporation that did tremendous work on resuscitating activity  along the Lagan; many share my view. I am keen for the same type of  regeneration to continue.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: Laganside has, undoubtedly, been a great success story.  More than &pound;1 billion has been invested in the area, and, by 2007, some 15,000  jobs, 231,000 sq m of office space and 803 homes had been created. I am  delighted to add that my Department will oversee a further &pound;500 million of  investment between now and 2012. That investment is part of the Laganside  legacy; developments such as the landmark Obel building, The Boat, Lanyon Towers,  the Soloist, the Four Corners and St Anne&rsquo;s Square will bring further  prosperity and jobs to Northern    Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Recently, I announced two new regeneration initiatives for  the riverfront. I commissioned a study to make recommendations on the  redevelopment of the Lagan Lookout and the riverside area around the Lagan Weir  towards Lanyon Place.  Potential improvements include the transformation of the Lagan Lookout into a  multi-use visitors&rsquo; centre and the provision of a mini marina at the weir to  encourage small craft to moor alongside it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I commissioned a second study to recommend how to improve  pedestrian and bicycle access across the river from the east bank to the city  centre. Previous studies highlighted the potential for new footbridges from  Donegall Quay to Queen&rsquo;s Quay or from the Gasworks to Ormeau Park,  and for an enhancement of the existing footbridge at the Lagan Weir. Within the  next six months, I hope to announce the results of the studies and reveal how  and when the riverside projects will proceed.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Eco Homes Good Rating Standards</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">8. <strong>Mr  Elliott </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development what plans are in place  to build more social housing that conforms to the Eco Homes &lsquo;good&rsquo; rating  standards.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO425/09> (AQO 425/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: When I launched the new housing agenda earlier this  year, I announced that all new social housing built from 1 April 2008 would  conform to level 3 of the new code on sustainable housing. Social housing will,  therefore, be built to a higher standard than the eco-home rating of good. The  new code requires houses to be 25% more energy efficient than ever before. At a  time of significant increases in energy prices, not only will those new homes  benefit the environment, but their tenants will have greater protection against  struggling to meet their future energy costs.</p>

	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Comber Greenway</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Debate resumed on motion:</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly acknowledges the health benefits that  outdoor exercise offers children and adults, including positive mental  well-being; recognises that safe walking and cycling routes contribute greatly  to this and are in short supply in urban areas; and calls on the Minister for  Regional Development to preserve safe pedestrian and cyclist access on the  Comber Greenway. &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Ms Purvis.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  When I first examined the motion, I considered it sensible. However, after  further assessment, I am worried that it might exclude the full and proper use  of the old Comber railway line for the development of a rapid-transit line.  Although I favour a light-rail line, some form of rapid transit is essential to  allow people from the south and east of the city quick, easy access to Belfast.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Molloy] in the Chair)</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The investment strategy for Northern Ireland recognised the  important role that a rapid-transit system would play in providing a step  change in public transportation. A commitment was made to start work on the  first rapid-transit line before 2011. That commitment must be honoured, and  regardless of whatever may happen to the old Comber railway line, rapid transit  must be the priority. I hope that pedestrian and cyclist access can be  integrated. However, the policy context for the development of a rapid-transit  network is well defined, and there is widespread recognition &mdash; in all  Departments &mdash; that a good rapid-transit system is a key element in the economic  and infrastructural regeneration of Belfast and the greater Belfast metropolitan  area.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I cannot overstress the importance of a comprehensive,  cross-departmental approach to urban regeneration and infrastructural  development. The development of a rapid-transit system must not be addressed as  a single issue; it should, rather, be considered in the wider context of  economic growth, regeneration and future prosperity &mdash; that should not be  sacrificed easily. Therefore, I am protective of the opportunity provided by  the Comber Greenway. However, I will not elaborate. A report produced by Atkins  &mdash; which the House debated on 3 June &mdash; assessed several options. However, at  least two of the options outlined therein &mdash; options 2 and 3 &mdash; would have  required the use of the space afforded by the Comber railway line.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Belfast needs space to breathe and to enable people to  enter and exit the city easily and quickly. Belfast is reinventing itself as  one of Europe&rsquo;s most vibrant and progressive business locations, and the recent  establishment of the Victoria Square complex dramatically increased retail  capacity. Furthermore, Belfast has become one of the 10 largest retail centres  in the United Kingdom. The regeneration of the Cathedral Quarter, the Titanic  Quarter and various other ambitious projects will contribute to that  revitalisation. However, the downside is the increasing congestion on our  roads, the serious access problems in Belfast and the difficulty of finding  available car-parking spaces. Much of the present congestion is a direct result  of dependence on an inadequate car- and bus-based public transport system.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Belfast has, historically, been at the cutting edge of  technological advances. One hundred years ago, the world&rsquo;s largest ship was  built in Belfast. Furthermore, the City Hall was built in Belfast, and it  introduced one of the earliest street-lighting systems. From 1905, Belfast had  an extensive electric tram system, which succeeded the horse-drawn tram system.  In 1908, a significant expansion of the system incorporated Queen&rsquo;s Island,  which is not far from the Comber railway line under discussion today. That  system existed until 1953 and, at its peak, stretched for more than 40 miles of  track. In 1936, electrically driven trolleybuses were introduced, and the tram  system was abandoned in 1954.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must preserve the space that is required to build an  adequate rapid-transport system. My preference is for a light-rail system. In  time, we can prove that that is the better system, and the old Comber railway  line&rsquo;s disused track is vital to that project. I support the broad thrust of  the motion, but &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Member to draw his remarks to a close.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  It would be better if a rapid-transit system could safely operate alongside  access for pedestrians and walkers, but the rapid-transit system should be the  priority.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I thank Assembly colleagues for bringing the motion to the House. As the  Alliance Party&rsquo;s health spokesperson, I fully support every effort to promote a  good, healthy, fresh outdoor life, and the Comber Greenway provides just that.  Every effort must be made to ensure that the Comber Greenway is preserved and  expanded, because it is an excellent provision for everyone.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Congratulations go to all the agencies that supported the  creation of the Comber Greenway. It is a perfect example of joined-up thinking.  It was not too long ago that I walked along part of that old railway track near  Comber. It was simply a pathway then, with soil, weeds, grass and,  unfortunately, some dog foul, which I avoided. Even so, many walkers, cyclists  and others were using it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The peacefulness of that entire area is truly magnificent,  unparalleled and unspoilt. One can see wildlife, birds and wild flowers, and  take in basic fresh air. One could describe the area as a bit of heaven on  earth, and it must be retained as such. It would be a total shame if the Comber  Greenway were to be compromised.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Money was spent on upgrading that excellent facility, and  that initiative was very much welcomed and supported by everyone in the  locality and by people further afield. If there is any chance that the Comber  Greenway will be interfered with &mdash; as has been suggested &mdash; a full consultation  exercise must be undertaken so that everyone in our community is provided with  an opportunity to contribute to the debate. At the end of that consultation,  everything will have been investigated and the right decision will be made for  the right reasons.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I sincerely hope that the present wonderful environment  that is the Comber Greenway will remain and will continue to be enjoyed by  everyone. I support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Newton</strong>: I  also support the motion. Although I welcome the debate, I find it difficult to  understand how this motion was accepted as private Members&rsquo; business. Many  Members see it as a more suitable topic for an Adjournment debate. Mr Deputy  Speaker, must I declare an interest as a regular user of the walkway?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: You have done so by mentioning that fact.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Newton</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. As a regular user of the Comber Greenway to walk  my dogs, I do not see the massive number of people that some Members would have  us believe make use of the route. Like many other Members, I fully appreciate  the route and the pleasant environment that has been created. I also welcome  the &pound;32 million Connswater Community Greenway project that will be developed in  close proximity, and will provide other recreation and walking areas for the  people of east Belfast and beyond.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Other Members referred to the previous debate about this  issue that took place on 3 June 2008. At that time, the Minister gave  assurances that the Comber Greenway would be retained as a walking and cycling  facility alongside the creation of the rapid-transport system. One of the  proposers of today&rsquo;s motion did not participate in that debate, and having  listened to her speech, I am not sure whether Ms Purvis is in favour of the  rapid-transport project or is opposed to it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In 2003, essential work started along parts of the old  Comber railway line to lay a new sewer, and that resulted in the emergence of  health and recreation opportunities for people of the area and, indeed, further  afield. A walking and cycling route was created along what was always intended  to be a route for a rapid-transit system.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The facility was completed in the full knowledge that the  route would be used for a rapid-transit system in the foreseeable future, and  the development of such a route was debated, and supported, in Castlereagh  Borough Council by councillors from all the political parties that were  represented.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In a previous debate on the matter, the Minister for  Regional Development told the Assembly:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;I am confident that proposals can be developed that  will not push cyclists and walkers off the route.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official Report, Vol 31,  No 3, p169, col 1].</span></span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the Department for Regional Development&rsquo;s &lsquo;Corporate  Plan 2008-2011: Business Plan 2008-2009&rsquo;, on targeting specific audiences, the  section on transport infrastructure, confirms:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;These will include the promotion of walking, cycling,  public transport, car sharing, personal travel planning as well as Park &amp;  Ride and Park &amp; Share facilities.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I am confident that the Committee for Regional  Development will hold the Department to those objectives.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I only wanted to make a few points about the matter, and I  shall finish with the following. The rapid-transport project is important not  only to the east of the city but, holistically, to the Belfast economy. A  healthy environment is also important. Furthermore, as the project is  developed, communication with the public &mdash; especially with those who live in  close proximity to the project &mdash; will be vital. The benefits to the economy are  obvious; however, they must be clearly explained and conveyed to the wider  public. The system&rsquo;s specification must be to a high level; private-sector  investment should be encouraged; and in order to attract people off current  public transport and out of their cars, passenger service should be of the  highest quality.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  This matter is relevant to both of the Committees of which I am a member. The  benefits of safe walking and cycling routes cannot be overestimated to  individuals, Government and society at large. The health benefits of outdoor  exercise are manifold. Exercise helps individuals and families to live more  healthy and contented lives, from reducing the risk of developing heart disease  to reducing the likelihood of depression, which affects health and social  services by reducing the number of patients in the NHS. Walking and cycling  also help to reduce congestion on the roads, reducing carbon emissions and, in  turn, helping us to meet our carbon-reduction targets. Therefore, it is  regrettable that Northern Ireland has a limited number of dedicated walking and  cycling routes in urban and rural areas. I urge the Minister to further develop  such routes, as well as developing more cycle paths on the road network.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for Regional Development has received  representations from residents who are concerned that the proposed E-way route  from Belfast city centre to Dundonald &mdash; included in the &lsquo;Strategic Outline Case  for Rapid Transit in Belfast&rsquo; &mdash; will damage the existing facility that the  Department has helped to develop along the old Belfast to Dundonald rail line.  In addition, campaigners to save the greenway have made strong representations  to the Committee for Regional Development, outlining their concerns that the  route will be degraded or threatened.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Nevertheless, the Ulster Unionist Party has expressed its  support, in principle, for developing the rapid-transit system in Belfast,  which it believes will bring positive environmental, social and economic  benefits. The Department has stated that both the rapid-transit system and the  cycle way can be accommodated on the relevant section of the route that is  planned to run along the old Belfast to Comber rail line, which I and the  Committee have inspected.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My Committee colleagues and I have received a further  technical report, undertaken for the Department by independent consultants, on  the potential use of the Upper Newtownards Road as an alternative route. We  require time to consider that and to compare the costs and benefits of the  routes. Although I recognise the benefits of walking and cycling and of the  development of the rapid-transit system in Belfast, I urge the Minister to  continue his engagement with stakeholders and user groups to ensure that the  views of current greenway users are utilised to secure the best possible  walking and cycling route. We support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I support the general thrust of the motion, although I do not support all the comments  that have been made in support of it. I want to concentrate &mdash; as have most  Members &mdash; on the latter part of the motion that concentrates on the greenway,  rather than the &ldquo;motherhood and apple pie&rdquo; bit at the start of it that no one  in their right mind would disagree with. I welcome all the references to  Comber, my home town &mdash; probably more than have been made in any debate in the  House &mdash; and I am sure that they will be well received by the people of that  area.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have always been a strong supporter of having a cycle  path and dedicated walkway between Belfast and Comber for many obvious reasons,  including the potential that they would have for developing tourism and  providing that area with a unique selling point. They have been successful in  that regard and beyond. As all Members who have spoken in the debate have said,  I want to see the retention of safe pedestrian and cyclist access to the  greenway. However, I do not want that comment or my support for the motion to  be misconstrued as my being opposed to a rapid-transit scheme being developed  along the line, or as my being opposed to the E-way.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If anything, I have two regrets about the E-way proposals.  The first is that the E-way does not extend as far as Comber. The second is  that it is to be a guided-bus system and not a light-rail system; however, I  hope that, as Belfast develops, that kind of system will be introduced.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I understand some of the concerns that have been expressed  by members of the public who live along the Comber Greenway; however, the tone  of the campaign opposing the E-way has been regrettable at times. Some  misleading language was used in a poster that I saw in a shop in Comber &mdash; it  seemed to suggest that the entire greenway would be used for the E-way. As I  said, I regret that that is not the case. However, I believe that,  unfortunately, that misleading language was an attempt to inflame the  situation. When I brought that to the attention of the campaigners, they  accepted that they had made a mistake.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Also doing the rounds currently is a flyer with a depiction  of four power-plant cooling towers alongside what I suppose is a picture of the  Comber Greenway &mdash; I do not know what the former image has to do with the  situation. That sort of outright rejection of the E-way along the Comber Greenway  line, as manifested in the language and imagery that is used in the publicity,  is aimed at inflaming the situation and is unhelpful to the debate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, I understand some of the concerns about the  future of the greenway. It has been an immensely successful line, but, as  others have pointed out, it was always designated as a rapid-transit route &mdash;  indeed, it has widespread support among the political parties in the Chamber.  Therefore, it was always known that the E-way would be developed along that  line at some stage, and it was always going to be the case that the E-way route  would have to be accommodated alongside the cycle path and walkway.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">One of the arguments that has been used as outright  opposition to the establishment of the E-way rapid-transit route is the  environmental impact that it will have on the Comber Greenway. In response, I  ask people to consider the environmental impact of continuing with the current  level of commuting to Belfast that occurs on a daily basis and its impact in the  production of pollution, emissions and traffic congestion on the Newtownards  Road, the Comber Road, the Kings Road, and other roads leading into Belfast  from that direction. I have no doubt that the E-way will contribute to cutting  the emissions, congestion and pollution along that route.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I accept that a cycle path and walking route alongside the  E-way from Belfast to Dundonald is the second-best option at best, and that it  will change the existing amenity. However, a rapid-transit system in  conjunction with a dedicated and safe cycle path could provide the best of both  worlds for everyone in that part of Belfast and beyond.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A hae gat a clatter o&rsquo; screeds fae consairned constituients  aboot the Cumber Greenwie an&rsquo; A wus sarious gled when the chanst cum ap fer me  tae shaire thon wi&rsquo; the members o&rsquo; this &lsquo;Semmelie.

Lately a clatter  o catter wus spent oan thon airt wi&rsquo; the hope o&rsquo; heftin&rsquo; mair fowk tae waak an&rsquo;  bicycle an thon wus successful.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have received many letters from concerned constituents  about the Comber Greenway, and so I was pleased when the opportunity arose for  me to share them with the Assembly. The Comber Greenway is a walking and  cycling route, extending from Comber to east Belfast. Recently, a large amount  of money was spent in the area in the hope of encouraging more people to walk  and cycle; an enterprise that has been successful.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I recently received a communication from Sustrans, telling  me that the Comber Greenway is already popular. Based on its research of  similar routes, it estimated that usage will increase steadily on completion of  the linear route in November 2008.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The development of the greenway has been a successful  partnership, uniting the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, Roads  Service, the Northern Ireland Environment Agency, the Department of Culture,  Arts and Leisure and Sustrans. It has also united Belfast City Council,  Castlereagh Borough Council and Ards Borough Council, which is a feat in itself</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The greenway is much more than a transport corridor. It  provides a wide range of community facilities, such as exercise, play and  social interaction, with an estimated 20% of its users being under 16. Indeed,  not that far from the greenway &mdash; towards the playing fields in Dundonald and  the Ballyrainey Road &mdash; I used to shoot pigeons and magpies. However, that was a  long time ago.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The greenway offers a very good cost benefit for walking  and cycling, particularly for health and well-being. Therefore, I agree with  the proposal made by Sustrans for a public consultation, led by the Department  for Regional Development, with local communities along the route of the Comber  Greenway.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, a rapid-transport system is also an important part  of the vision for that area. It will provide relief from congested roads,  allowing people to avoid the long queues. It is more than possible &mdash; it is  desirable &mdash; that a rapid-transport system co-exist with the Comber Greenway. It  can and should be done. The financial and environmental savings will be great,  and keeping the greenway intact will also ensure that people retain the option  to walk, cycle or use the bus &mdash; all the things that we are trying to promote.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, many of my constituents have written to me on  this issue, and I would like to provide the House with some examples of what  they have told me. One constituent &mdash; a car commuter from Newtownards to Belfast  &mdash; would welcome a quality park-and-ride scheme that reduced traffic on the  Upper Newtownards Road and that provided him and other users with a swift and  convenient bus ride into Belfast. They said that traffic queues from the Ards  area are horrific at present, and any Members who travel on that road regularly  can vouch for that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I received a letter from a motorcyclist who told me that he  would welcome a new bus lane, with motorcycle access into Belfast, providing a  safer route, away from larger vehicles. That constituent also felt that it  would be absurd to destroy the old railway, as it has received so much  Government money recently. Therefore, they would welcome something to add to  the existing facilities offered by the greenway</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Comber Greenway, which is part of national cycle route  99, is a fantastic and unique facility providing a safe, traffic-free route for  sustainable transport, both cycling and walking. My colleague Robin Newton told  the House that he walks it regularly; he is not the only person to do so. Many  people use the facility to walk their dogs, to go for a stroll or to keep fit.  Many children also use it as an area in which to play.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is the only dedicated cycle route into Ards from Belfast  &mdash; the main point of tourist entry into Northern Ireland. Therefore, it has  tremendous potential as a tourist attraction, drawing low-impact, high-spending  cyclists into the area.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Last summer, I was delighted to be able to show off the  route to some visiting Belgian cyclists. They enjoyed the wonderful route &mdash; and  they know a thing or two about quality cycling routes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The constituents in the area &mdash; and the DUP &mdash; have made  clear that they want to see the rapid-transport system in operation. I believe  that that system can coexist with the Comber Greenway. The funding to enhance  this beautiful section of Ards and east Belfast should be made available  alongside the incorporation of the rapid-transport system into the area.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development (Mr Murphy)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann  Comhairle. I thank Dawn Purvis and Naomi Long for tabling the motion, and I  thank the Members who contributed to the debate. Despite some differences of  emphasis, it has been a constructive debate. Support for the motion has been  expressed on all sides of the Chamber, which is encouraging.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the opportunity to speak to the motion. I will  try to pick up on as many Members&rsquo; comments as possible, but I have also asked  my officials to take note of the Hansard report so that I can write to Members  after the debate with a response to anything that I might miss.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion proposes that the Assembly acknowledges the  benefits to all of providing safe pedestrian and cycling routes. The promotion  of walking and cycling is a key ingredient of the Department for Regional  Development&rsquo;s regional transportation strategy. Cycling, in particular, can  play a bigger role in our future transport strategies, and it has the potential  to contribute to reversing current trends in traffic congestion and carbon  emissions. Importantly, it can also have a positive impact on people&rsquo;s health  by giving them the opportunity to exercise regularly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased to say that cycle-usage figures published in  2008 show that overall cycle usage has increased by 37% across the North and by  87% in Belfast. However, I accept that the Government must continue to develop  and improve sustainable transport modes to meet the challenges ahead. The  Department for Regional Development is playing its part in trying to encourage  more people to use sustainable modes of transport, such as cycling, walking and  public transport. Those forms of transport are healthy, carbon efficient and  environmentally friendly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The various transport plans have proposed cycle facilities  for areas in which it is considered that they are most needed and most likely  to be used. The provision of continuous cycle networks is considered most  beneficial in towns that have significant numbers of existing cyclists or where  large student populations and flat cycling conditions suggest greatest  potential.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Belfast metropolitan transport plan was developed to  address the long-term transport infrastructure for the city. It included  proposals for walking, cycling, bus, rail and rapid transit, and it is the  current basis for the development of transport infrastructure in the city. We  have made a significant contribution towards the development of the national  cycle network in the North. It comprises 983 kms of on-road cycle routes and  162 kms of off-road cycle track. That equates to a total of 1,145 kms &mdash; some  716 miles. However, I accept John McCallister&rsquo;s comments, and that is something  that the Department wishes to develop, given that it is important to the  Department.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText" style="margin-top:4.25pt;">One of the Department&rsquo;s key  commitments is to contribute to safer roads by using a range of initiatives,  such as road safety engineering, traffic calming and further enhancement of the  pedestrian and cycling network. Total spend on cycling facilities during the  period 2002-09 will be some &pound;6&middot;6 million.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText" style="margin-top:4.25pt;">The cycling forum brings together  the major organisations that have an interest in cycling: DRD, Roads Service,  Sustrans, Translink, the Health Promotion Agency. district councils and  voluntary groups.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText" style="margin-top:4.25pt;">The Department for Regional  Development, in conjunction with the cycling forum, published a cycling  strategy for the North in June 2000. That strategy identified a range of  measures to improve conditions for cyclists, with a view to establishing a  pro-cycling culture.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText" style="margin-top:4.25pt;">I recognise the importance of  cycling and to further explore its potential, we will soon organise a  conference to focus on how we can get more people on to their bikes and out of  their cars.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText" style="margin-top:4.25pt;">The Department&rsquo;s Travelwise  initiative encourages the use of sustainable transport options, such as walking  and cycling. That initiative is delivered in partnership with the Department of  Education, DOE&rsquo;s road safety branch, Sustrans, the Health Promotion Agency and  Translink. Its aim is to help people to understand the problem and to be aware  of how they can be part of the solution. It promotes the use of sustainable  transport, which leads to better personal health, and it introduces walking and  cycling to schools. It also provides useful safety information.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText" style="margin-top:4.25pt;">The Department is working closely  with the east Belfast partnership boards, which are developing plans for the  Connswater Community Greenway following a successful bid to the Big Lottery  Fund. I, therefore, welcome the motion&rsquo;s objective to acknowledge the health  benefits that outdoor exercise, through walking and cycling, offers children  and adults.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText" style="margin-top:4.25pt;">In June this year, I introduced  to the House proposals to introduce a rapid-transit network for Belfast. I was  encouraged by the constructive nature of the debate on that day and on how  Members focused on the benefits that rapid transit would bring. During that  debate, I reminded Members that rapid transit for Belfast was not a new  concept, but one that had been included in all relevant land-use and transport  policies and plans for many years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText" style="margin-top:4.25pt;">I stated that proposals for a  rapid-transit system in Belfast had been talked about for many years, but that  the time for talking was coming to an end. It is now time to deliver. At that  time, several Members highlighted their concerns about the use of the Comber  Greenway for a rapid-transit system, which I have visited since then.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod" style="margin-top:4.25pt;">4.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have received correspondence from members of the public  who use the Comber Greenway, and I have had discussions with elected  representatives who are concerned with the proposals for a rapid-transit  system. It has been suggested that taxpayers&rsquo; money has been wasted in developing  the route for walking and cycling if it is to be changed in the near future.  Indeed, there have been rumours in the community &mdash; which Dawn Purvis referred  to &mdash; that my Department intends to replace the Comber Greenway with a four-lane  motorway. I assure the House that that is not the case.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although I appreciate fully the genuine concerns expressed  about the proposed changes to the Comber Greenway, the reality is very  different. In 2003, Water Service undertook work to build a new sewer along  parts of the former railway line, and that has already been referred to by  Members opposite. That work presented my Department with an opportunity to  create a cost-effective temporary walking and cycling route along the corridor  while plans for a rapid-transit system were being progressed. That was  recognised by Sustrans at the time, who suggested that, as and when the  rapid-transit plans were developed further, the walking and cycling path could  be incorporated alongside the E-way scheme. That pathway would provide a  short-term opportunity to encourage walking and cycling on the route before a  decision was taken on a rapid-transit system. All those who were developing the  route were fully aware of that decision.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is also important to note that the plans for a rapid-transit  system are for only sections of the Comber Greenway &mdash; from Dundonald to  Belfast, as has already been said. Several campaigners have stated that they  were disappointed that the proposals for a rapid-transit system did not  undertake an assessment of the use of the Upper Newtownards Road. After  listening to the concerns expressed, we asked the consultants to reconsider  that option. They found that using the Upper Newtownards Road for a  rapid-transit system would not work, as it would mean taking two lanes out of  an already busy road, which would also have to be widened. All parking on the  road would have to be banned and that would be unpopular with residents,  shoppers and shopkeepers. Traffic congestion would increase, leading to  rat-running traffic through residential areas. Despite such measures, the  consultants forecast lower passenger numbers, due to the fact that the service  would be slower.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My vision for the corridor has not changed. It is a vision  of a world-class rapid-transit system alongside a high-quality walking and  cycling route.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The benefits of a rapid-transit system are in danger of  being forgotten in this debate. Belfast is the economic driver of the region,  and people need to be able to move about the city quickly for it to operate efficiently.  The rapid-transit system will allow for that. It will offer vehicles at  five-minute intervals, with journey times from Dundonald to the city centre of  between 16 and 20 minutes. Over 2&middot;1 million people will use the service each  year, and over 20% of its rush-hour traffic will come from current car users.  That figure has been derided as not sufficiently high to justify interference  with the Comber Greenway. However, I assure Members that those are good  projection figures for the first few years of a new transport system. If 20% of  current car users switched to the rapid-transit system, there would be over  400,000 fewer car trips, and the 750 cars that use the park-and-ride facility  at Ballybeen would also be taken off that stretch of road.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The House should be aware that the issues surrounding the  use of the Comber Greenway were discussed recently at the draft Belfast  metropolitan area plan public inquiry. The draft Belfast metropolitian area  plan (BMAP) designates the Comber Greenway as a rapid-transit walking and  cycling route.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Reg Empey, who is not in the Chamber, raised issues about  the Holywood Arches. I assure him that those issues were addressed in the  report. The preferred route beyond the Holywood Arches was identified, and  consultation is ongoing with residents in that area about the preferred route.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am fully aware of the sensitivity of developing the  Comber Greenway for walking, cycling and rapid transit. The Committee for  Regional Development raised that issue following its examination of the  strategic outline case. Some Members have questioned whether there is enough  room to develop a rapid-transit system alongside the walking and cycling track.  I have twice asked the consultants to consider the issue, and they have assured  me that there is enough room to develop both systems side by side. I would not  for one minute try to mislead the House and say that the current nature of the  Comber Greenway will not change &mdash; obviously it will change if a rapid-transit  system uses it. However, I have asked the consultants to consider carefully the  matter, and they have assured me that there is the ability to fit both systems  side by side, and to retain cycling and walking along the Comber Greenway.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As our plans develop, my officials will continue to meet a  range of key stakeholders including representatives of the greenway to Stay  group, Sustrans, Mersey Street residents&rsquo; association and the East Belfast  Partnership.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I assure Members that we have already secured developer  contributions for the rapid-transit system, and we will continue to seek other  developer contributions when the possibility arises. I am establishing a  dedicated rapid-transit delivery team. Following Executive approval, I intend  to proceed to the detailed design of the network, which will allow us to  examine its full particulars.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will work with a range of individuals, including local  communities, during the design of the network, and I hope to convince people  who are sceptical about the plans. I will not try to mislead the House by saying  that the Comber Greenway will remain unaltered. However, throughout the design  process and our consultation with elected representatives and the local  community, I hope that we can convince people that the plans can work and that  the Comber Greenway can be retained.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">After representations were made to me about the nature of  the greenway, I took the opportunity to walk along parts of it and, indeed, it  is a very nice and popular facility. I intend to preserve safe pedestrian and  cyclist access on the Comber Greenway, both before and after the introduction  of the rapid-transit system.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: I  am glad that we have had the opportunity to discuss the proposals for the  Comber Greenway this afternoon. Robin Newton asked why the debate was not an  Adjournment debate. The motion was forwarded to the Business Committee as an  Adjournment debate, but the Business Committee rejected it in that format on  the basis that the issue is part of the Executive&rsquo;s Programme for Government  and concerns more than one constituency. Indeed, it is more appropriate for the  matter to be discussed as Private Members&rsquo; Business, as it has given the  Minister an opportunity to give a detailed response and allowed Members from  outside East Belfast to participate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is very important for the future of the city and the  entire region that we achieve a modal shift and increase the use of public  transport. Irrespective of swiftness, the key factor that determines whether  people use public transport is its frequency and cost.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Comber Greenway has been a huge success, and the  Department for Regional Development (DRD) must be commended for that. Indeed,  the difficulty has arisen because the success of the greenway has been far  beyond what could have been anticipated when it was put in place as a temporary  walkway. Prior to the works that were undertaken by DRD after the pipeline  project, the walkway had largely fallen into disrepair. That situation was  great for the wildlife, but it did not encourage the widespread usage of the  facility that we had hoped for. However, the greenway has become incredibly  successful among people who commute by bicycle and those who use it for leisure  walking and cycling.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The local community has bought into the greenway massively.  In addition to using it as a cycle path, the local community&rsquo;s sense of  ownership has been hugely important. Local people have worked with statutory  agencies and the council to maintain and develop the area. For example, a  campaign was driven by the public for the police to open land at Brookland and  enable the development of the greenway&rsquo;s last section. The level of public  enthusiasm for the greenway makes the proposals more contentious than they  would otherwise have been.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Dawn Purvis outlined the health and well-being benefits of  what is a quiet and safe oasis in the densely urban fabric of East Belfast.  People in the city have the right to enjoy the outdoors safely. Although I  accept what the Minister said about the Connswater Greenway, that was a  different prospect in a different locality. The Connswater Greenway was seen as  an additional project rather than as a replacement for the Comber Greenway.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are competing tensions between the significant number  of commuters who wish to move quickly to the city centre and the people who  wish to access East Belfast&rsquo;s shops, schools, and healthcare facilities. If  anyone needs proof of the huge amount of traffic generated by the latter group,  they should try to travel through East Belfast during the school holidays.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am not convinced that the proposals will address the  traffic concerns of the people who access those facilities in East Belfast.  Indeed, in my intervention during Lord Browne&rsquo;s speech, I expressed concern  that the 4A bus service &mdash; which operates along the Upper Newtownards Road &mdash; will  be undermined or diminished. Lord Browne may be happy to leave that matter to  departmental consultants, but I am concerned about that &mdash; other constituents of  mine in Tullycarnet, Braniel and Cregagh have lost bus services as a result of  consultants&rsquo; reports. Ultimately, whether the service can wash its own face is  a financial decision. We must be cautious about the impact that such an  approach could have on those shops and schools on main arterial routes that are  public transport currently accesses.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Cathal Boylan and other Members said that the Comber  Greenway has been earmarked for rapid transit for a long time. We all  acknowledge that that is true. It was also previously earmarked for a four-lane  highway. Thankfully, that was one hare-brained scheme that did not come to  fruition, something for which we are all grateful. The combination of repeated  delay and inactivity lulled people into a false sense of security. More  importantly, the quality of the new provision and its popularity has meant that  it is much more valued than it was previously.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Reg Empey asked what is to happen at the end of the  walkway, and there still seems to be a question mark over that. I understand  that the preferred route is now to head towards the Titanic Quarter, which  represents a change in direction. Robin Newton said that he rarely sees large  numbers of people on the Comber Greenway. I can only suggest that that is  because they know that he is coming, because most of us see many people using  it &mdash; Robin knows that I am only joking.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I accept that a rapid-transit system may remove cars from  the main arterial route. However, my concern is that the effect would be  temporary &mdash; when people see traffic flowing more freely on the Upper  Newtownards Road, they will, as they have done in the past, simply revert to  using their cars. They may choose to use their cars to access many of the  facilities along those main arterial routes, so I have my doubts about how  successful that approach would be. I accept that the rapid-transit system, in  and of itself, may be successful in bringing people to the city centre, but  those who have used the walkway for its amenity and for leisure will be less  attracted to it than those who use the walkway to commute, cycle or walk. Those  who use the walkway with their families, and so on, may find their experience  to be quite different.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Simon Hamilton talked about how a rapid-transit system  would benefit the environment. I accept that that is a balanced argument.  However, when people talk about the degradation of the environment, they are  not talking about the global environment; rather, they are talking about the  local environment and its amenity. That valid concern has been expressed. To be  fair, the Minister has been open and honest in saying that the proposals may degrade  the quality of that particular environment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am at least assured that if a rapid-transit system is  introduced, Jim Shannon will not be out taking potshots at some of the  wildlife. I imagine that that would be a public hazard, so, if nothing else, we  can be thankful for that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s presence and his participation  in all the debates on the matter. He has constructively addressed the issues  that have been raised. The BMAP process identified the route, but it is an  incredibly unwieldy process. Everyone would concede that it is not a process in  which most members of the public feel they can actively and fully participate.  It creates quite an intimidating environment in which to make representations.  The specific proposal for the Comber Greenway really requires a separate  consultation process in which the public can engage.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I remain concerned about the plans for the Comber Greenway,  but I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to engage with local  representatives and residents. Many may be disappointed that it appears that  plans for a rapid-transit system will proceed regardless of their concerns.  However, I hope that through discussions with Sustrans, residents and others,  it will be possible to find some way in which to maintain the environment to as  high a standard as possible.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I return to the key point &mdash; the Comber Greenway is a valued  piece of ground for the people who use it. Use of the greenway has increased,  and it has increased cycling levels by more than it is anticipated use of  public-transport will increase, so it is more successful in those terms. The  greenway has made a huge difference to people&rsquo;s health and well-being. I hope  that we can continue negotiation and discussion on the future of the greenway  in order to ensure that the amenity of the greenway, as well as its  environmental impact, is fully protected.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly acknowledges the health benefits that  outdoor exercise offers children and adults, including positive mental well-being;  recognises that safe walking and cycling routes contribute greatly to this and  are in short supply in urban areas; and calls on the Minister for Regional  Development to preserve safe pedestrian and cyclist access on the Comber  Greenway.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Motion made:</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly do now adjourn. &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Mr  Deputy Speaker.]</span><em><span style="font-size:10.5pt; "> </span></em></p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="9"></a>Adjournment</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Primary School Education in South Belfast</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind Members that the proposer of the topic will have 15  minutes in which to speak.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  I welcome the opportunity to debate this issue, and I thank the Minister for  attending today. We could all achieve positive outcomes as a result of debates  such as this.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In recent months, I have been engaged in a specific  outreach programme with all primary schools across South Belfast; I visited  most of the schools and had lengthy and frank discussions with principals,  teachers and support staff. I witnessed at first hand the deep passion that  principals, teachers and support staff have for the job in hand and also their  unswerving dedication and commitment to their profession and to the pupils whom  they teach.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I brought the issue to the House today, because many  teachers are being put under increasingly tremendous pressure; however, I do  not blame anyone in particular for that. Some of that pressure is historic, and  I am not for one moment accusing the Minister, lest it appear that way, as she  has been in position for only a year or 15 months. I am merely bringing those  issues to her attention. Much of the pressure is historic and has been around  for years as a result of inadequate support from us, as public representatives,  from education and library boards and from the Department. Nevertheless, staff  in many primary schools are being forced to work under very difficult and  trying circumstances.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the principals of Botanic Primary School, St  Bernard&rsquo;s Primary School and Rosetta Primary School for taking the time to be  with us to listen to the debate. I apologise if I have missed anyone out.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Every school has specific issues, which I do not intend to  go into in any great detail today; however, there are common issues of concern  that unite many primary schools across south Belfast. I will follow up on the  details of those issues with the Minister in due course, but I do not wish to  enter into undue discussion on them today.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is no secret that each principal, teacher and parent to  whom I have spoken is deeply anxious about the lack of certainty around the  transfer procedure, but I do not want to get into that debate at any length.  However, I wish to raise the biggest issue &mdash; underfunding. Time and again,  people have raised with me the issue of the age-weighted pupil unit. Pupils in  primary schools in Britain have a much better funding ratio compared with  secondary schools, which places many principals under considerable pressure. We  discussed the matter in the Assembly before the summer recess, and we will come  back to it, but I urge the Minister to relieve some of that tight financial  pressure if possible. The demands placed on principals and teachers are ever  growing, yet the funding, resources and support levels seem to be shrinking.  The reality &mdash; and I have seen it for myself &mdash; is that an increasing number of  primary schools have been forced to rely on private fundraising efforts by  parents to ensure their survival and to ensure that they can maintain the  standards that they have built up over many years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Rocketing energy costs are a big issue, and schools are  being placed in a frightful position. Electricity bills have more than doubled  in the past year, and oil and gas prices have risen dramatically. Some primary  schools are paying up to &pound;1,000 on heating bills alone. I know that the  Minister has made a bid to the Department of Finance and Personnel, but we must  find a mechanism to get money released to pay those fuel bills. School  principals have had to divert money away from staff and other much-needed  resources just to meet their fuel bills, and they need that financial support  now.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is a lack of resources to help the growing number of  children with special needs. That increase in numbers is happening in every  school in South Belfast. Early intervention is best practice worldwide, yet the  heightened criteria for reading units means that some children have to wait  years for admission.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The statementing process is another cause for concern.  According to the Department&rsquo;s figures, statementing costs &pound;3,000 a child. I  urge the Minister to simplify the overly bureaucratic and costly statementing  process. It is not beyond the wit of man to come up with a simpler &mdash; yet every  bit as effective &mdash; process that could achieve the same ends.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The increasing number of immigrant children is a big issue  for many schools in South Belfast, and presents massive challenges to school principals.  In Botanic Primary School, for example, 29 different mother tongues are spoken.  In other words, there are children from 29 different countries across the world  in that school. Children from 25 or 26 different countries attend Fane Street  Primary School. Without extra support for teaching English, that is a difficult  situation for teachers to operate in and meet their vocational commitment to  teaching and supporting those children.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText" style="margin-top:4.25pt;">Child protection is also an  important issue. We must have a cohesive cross-departmental strategy between  the areas of education and health in order to assist schools such as Botanic  Primary School and Fane Street Primary School. In many respects, they hit a  brick wall when it comes to obtaining help and support. The principal of  Botanic Primary School told me that children were arriving at the school &mdash; some  of whom were 11 years of age &mdash; who had never been to school before. That causes  massive disruption. The teachers are compelled to try to meet the needs of  those children. How can they meet the needs of an 11-year-old Romanian child  who has never been to school and balance that with the needs of the other  11-year-olds?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText" style="margin-top:4.25pt;">There are other challenges that  concern me. Many children across South Belfast are sitting in schools that are  not fit for purpose. Building and redeveloping schools, providing new schools  and amalgamating others are serious issues. Taughmonagh Primary School, St  Anne&rsquo;s Primary School, St Bride&rsquo;s Primary School and St Bernard&rsquo;s Primary  School are all eagerly awaiting promised newbuilds, but they still have no idea  when the building will start because of an excruciatingly slow decision-making  process.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText" style="margin-top:4.25pt;">I am aware that there are staff  and skills shortages in the Department&rsquo;s development and infrastructure division,  but we must find ways, through private finance or other means, to provide those  newbuild projects. It is not acceptable for children to sit in substandard  schools that are long past their sell-by date. We must do whatever is necessary  to procure decent accommodation that is fit for purpose &mdash; that children can be  taught in. We must put the required procurement arrangements in place.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText" style="margin-top:4.25pt;">Not only are the newbuild  projects that have been committed for several schools not going ahead, basic  levels of repair and maintenance are not being sustained. I could give Belvoir  Park Primary School as an example. The annual maintenance budgets that are  allocated to the Belfast Education and Library Board and the South Eastern  Education and Library Board &mdash; both of which bite into South Belfast &mdash; lag so  far behind the level of need and demand that the schools that are covered by  those boards are never reached. Given that the amount of money that is  available never matches need, schools can wait for years before basic maintenance  and repairs are carried out. In many cases, those schools are unhealthy, unsafe  and unfit for human habitation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText" style="margin-top:4.25pt;">In light of the current economic  climate, now would be a good time to perhaps make some cost-effective  investments in the schools estate and to release funding in order to break open  and initiate some of the projects that have been planned. We have a dramatic  opportunity to consider amalgamations. Without wishing to be prescriptive, I  know that there is a need for some kind of amalgamation in the catchment areas  of Rosetta, Newtownbreda and Knockbreda Primary Schools. I know that the  primary schools in Sandy Row, Donegall Road and Fane Street are crying out for  a single new school that would cover all three existing schools. As well as  giving a much-needed boost to the education system, such a move would help the  construction industry and open up opportunities for that industry at this very  difficult time.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText" style="margin-top:4.25pt;">Education, I admit, is difficult  and challenging at the best of times. The current debate and crisis on  selection adds to the problems, but that issue will have to be dealt with in  due course. I therefore urge the Minister to do what she can as soon as  possible to get that sorted out. However, many of the other problems that I  have discussed could be eased with some repairs, amalgamations and new building  as well as support for immigrant children and for those with special needs.  Action is also necessary. As I said earlier, although I do not blame the  Minister for the dysfunctional Department that she has inherited, there is a  need to ensure that that Department has a mechanism to approve the building of  a school. I have been involved in the redevelopment of Taughmonagh Primary  School, resources for which were promised some two or three years ago and on  which no progress has been made.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText" style="margin-top:4.25pt;">On this occasion, if the Minister  can get things moving to ensure that the schools are built, we should be  rallying around her and supporting her. I am sure that the issues that I have  mentioned in relation to South Belfast apply to constituencies and schools  right across the country. It breaks my heart to see schools that are not fit  for purpose, with toilets that are dysfunctional and that are a health and  safety risk. The issue must be tackled, and it must be tackled soon.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText" style="margin-top:4.25pt;">I am delighted that the Health  Minister is also present, as certain issues are cross-cutting and within the  remit of both Departments. I plead with both Ministers to ensure that the  education system is made a priority both in the Chamber and by the Executive.  It must be made a priority because my heart bleeds when I see the circumstances  in which some children have to survive.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName" style="margin-top:4.25pt;"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Given that several Members have indicated that  they wish to speak, I ask Members to limit their contributions to eight  minutes.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName" style="margin-top:4.25pt;"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>: I thank Dr McDonnell for securing the debate. The  education of our children is a matter that every parent takes very seriously,  and it is only right for the parents in South Belfast that the education of  their children is at centre stage today. When I saw the Adjournment debate  scheduled for today, I thought that the topic covered a broad area. Many issues  that face specific schools could be raised, a few of which I have decided to  discuss. Indeed, Dr McDonnell has raised already some of the issues that affect  the South Belfast area in particular.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In recent visits that I have made to schools in South  Belfast, I have been struck by the ethnic diversity of the constituency. Our  primary-school sector must rise to the challenge of embracing and educating  many children from many different backgrounds. On a recent visit to Fane Street  Primary School off the Lisburn Road, the principal, Mr Orr, pointed out a  display on the wall of a corridor to me, which highlighted the many different  nationalities across the pupil profile. It struck me how challenging that must  be for the principal and the teachers because of pupils&rsquo; varying standards of  English and their cultural differences, all of which must be dealt with in the  classroom.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">5.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Some children from ethnic minority backgrounds receive  specialist support from tutors from the inclusion and diversity service, which  is based at the Antrim Board Centre and provides advice on pastoral and  language requirements as well as assessing children&rsquo;s progress. It is important  that children are welcomed to our schools and that they receive every  assistance in adapting not only to the school but to their new environment.  Support must also be given to teachers and principals in that area.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must also examine the schools estate in South Belfast  and recognise that, although great work has been done, much investment is  required to bring our schools up to the necessary standard required for  twenty-first-century education. Newbuilds, such as the one that is planned for  Taughmonagh Primary School, are welcome, and the sooner they happen the better,  for teachers and pupils. A new primary-school facility to serve the Donegall  Road area must also be brought to fruition to meet the requirements of local children.  We want greater educational attainment in such areas, and a pupil-friendly  school building is important in achieving that.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  commend the honourable Member for South Belfast for securing the debate.  Alasdair McDonnell referred to the problem of the transfer procedure, but a  plethora of policies is also being introduced, such as a proposal to revamp the  governance arrangements for schools. Does the Member agree that too much is  going on and that no priority is being given, at any stage, to phase in any of  those proposals, which is adding to the pressure and problems in our education  system? The education system is in meltdown.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>: I  agree with my honourable friend&rsquo;s comments. As I listen to boards of governors,  particularly of primary schools, I think that there is no doubt that the  transfer procedure, the education policies and the governance are putting  additional pressure on teachers and head teachers. A way must be found to phase  in those policies gradually.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Dr McDonnell mentioned some areas of concern &mdash; the  &ldquo;pressures&rdquo; &mdash; such as underfunding, which is a major issue for schools across  Northern Ireland. I am a member of a board of governors of a primary school  outside Belfast. At one recent meeting that I attended, parents were painting  the doors of the classrooms. That primary school is well run, but that incident  tells its own story. Through their amazing fund-raising efforts, parent-teacher  associations are picking up the slack in many areas by supplying equipment that  education and library boards should be supplying to schools for out-of-school  activities, and so forth.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The particular school to which I referred had damp spots,  and the parent-teacher association supplied replacement tiles for ceilings in  two or three classrooms because the board was not providing them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In Fane Street Primary School, which I visited recently,  window frames are being allowed to rot simply because they have not been given  a lick of paint. It is a tragedy that boards are allowing such things to  happen. Instead of painting the frames, boards are going to the expense of  replacing windows or fascia boards in schools at great cost when simple repairs  could have been undertaken for a small amount of money as part of routine  maintenance. That probably affects every school in South Belfast. The Minister  must examine that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Academic selection was also covered. I have learnt the  depth of feeling that exists on the issue from surveys that I have carried out  in the Finaghy and Saintfield Road areas and beyond. Of the responses I  received, 96% indicated support for academic selection. When asked what issue  MLAs should be prioritising, 84% of responses stated that transfer must be  sorted out as matter of urgency. If the Assembly is debating primary education  in South Belfast, it cannot ignore what is, undoubtedly, the biggest issue at  present. The Minister must listen to the 96% of respondents in my area &mdash; and I  have no doubt that similar surveys have been carried out in other areas &mdash; who  want academic selection to remain. Why is the Minister trying to advance a  programme of change, as she puts it, when the people of Northern Ireland have  clearly rejected her notions of change? I could discuss that subject for a long  time.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Greater funding is needed for extended-schools programmes,  particularly for special-needs provision. Members are aware of the problems  that exist in that area. Provision is, certainly, being drastically underfunded  by some boards, and that is causing schools, particularly primary schools,  major concern. I ask the Minister to take all of those issues into account and  to deal with them as soon as possible.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I join with Jimmy Spratt in  thanking Alasdair McDonnell for raising the issue of primary school education  in South Belfast in the Assembly. It is an important issue. Dr McDonnell has  covered a range of points, with which I do not believe anyone would disagree,  in considerable detail. In particular, the tone and manner with which he has  raised the topic and made his contribution are welcome and helpful.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It was worthwhile and helpful that Dr McDonnell undertook  an outreach programme and visited schools. I am sure that those schools  appreciated that particular outreach exercise, which allowed them to voice  their views at first hand. I, therefore, commend Dr McDonnell for that.  However, I want to say at the outset of my remarks that I have heard nothing in  the debate that the Minister has not already dealt with in forthright terms  during her time as Minister and, indeed, has often done before that in other  capacities. For example, the need to ensure that all children are treated  equally, properly and fairly has been to the forefront of the Minister&rsquo;s mind  in her work, certainly during all of the years that I have known her as a  political activist.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member, justifiably, brings to the Assembly&rsquo;s attention  the substantial financial pressures that are being brought to bear on schools.  The Minister has addressed that issue repeatedly. The condition of the school  estate is another issue that many Members have raised during the past several  years. I want to put on record my appreciation, and that of my colleagues, for  schools&rsquo; staff, teachers, parents and all of the people who are involved and  who often work in difficult circumstances to make schools viable and  sustainable in children&rsquo;s interests.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The topic for debate makes no reference to academic  selection. That subject has been mentioned, but I do not wish to take the  debate in that negative direction. However, I support the push for fundamental  change throughout the school system. We do not have the perfect school system,  as some would have us believe. I passed the 11-plus far too many years ago to  remember. I do not want a system that tells most of our children that they are  failures at 11 years of age; rather, I support radical change throughout the  school system. In the fullness of time, people involved in the education  sector, and primarily parents and children, will welcome the benefits which  will and should accrue to the system as we make the necessary changes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those changes have to be underpinned with the necessary and  appropriate level of resources; of that I have no doubt. As many Members have  already said, it is unacceptable that children are educated in schools that are  not up to standard or fit for purpose and which should be condemned. We all  want to ensure that children are given the best opportunities and taught in  schools that are warm, dry and in a good state of repair. In those conditions,  the teaching staff can get on with their job of delivering a proper education.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Alasdair has made the point that we must rally round the  Minister to ensure that she gets the necessary support, including considerable  additional funding, to ensure that schools are of a proper standard and that  all our children are given the best opportunities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister tell us how the funding will impact on  the area under discussion, South Belfast? The proposed education and skills  authority will have a central role in modernising the schools estate. I am keen  to know how that will be done in South Belfast. What of the additional finance  that is proposed for, or may have been allocated to, delivery of the revised  curriculum? What of the money to be made available to principals of small  primary schools, to enable them to get out of full-time teaching and devote  themselves to leadership and management? Those are important issues that we  cannot lose sight of.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I concur with virtually all the remarks made by Members  about the need to provide adequate support for schools. Many Members have  lobbied previous Ministers of Education and their officials for financial  support for, to take an example, English as an additional language. One of the  most positive developments in recent years has been the arrival in schools of  newcomers who contribute to diversity. In the fullness of time, we will all  recognise that. However, it has brought new challenges, some of which, I am  glad to say, have been met, while much more needs to be done. We need to  provide a welcoming environment. I know, from first hand, that many schools do  so: however, they need the appropriate level of support from the Department and  relevant boards to carry out that work.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Member who raised this topic for discussion. I  endorse most of the remarks made in the debate and commend all those involved  in the delivery of education to our children for their tremendous work.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">5.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  I speak in the debate as a Member for South Belfast, not as Minister of Health,  Social Services and Public Safety. I also declare an interest as a governor of  Stranmillis Primary School. I am grateful to Dr McDonnell for proposing this  topic for debate on an issue that goes right to the heart of many families in  South Belfast.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will begin by talking about some of the challenges that  we face. Mr Spratt and Dr McDonnell mentioned Taughmonagh Primary School. For  some years, I had campaigned for the school&rsquo;s replacement. However, in June  2007, I was disappointed to discover that the new Taughmonagh Primary School  was not on the procurement list. I lobbied the Minister and her office on the  issue, and I was delighted that, within a matter of weeks, Taughmonagh Primary  School found its rightful place on the procurement list, around this time last  year. I am grateful to the Minister for her intervention.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The procurement process for Taughmonagh Primary School is  under way, and I anticipate that builders will be on site in approximately 12  months&rsquo; time. As a result, the families and the parents of pupils who attend  the school, as well as people living in Taughmonagh estate, which is a severely  disadvantaged area in South Belfast, have had their confidence boosted.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Another issue that goes right to the heart of the matter is  the situation in three inner South Belfast primary schools &mdash; Blythefield,  Donegall Road and Fane Street &mdash; which are long past their sell-by date. Dr  McDonnell&rsquo;s remarks about pupils being taught in seriously substandard  accommodation apply to those three schools. We are working with parents and  groups to decide how to proceed. One proposal is to examine the possibility of  amalgamation. None of the schools is close to enrolling maximum pupil numbers,  because of the flight of population out of the city, and in particular, out of  the inner city.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">One big challenge that we face is to find and to identify a  site. A site search is ongoing, and is, I believe, close to conclusion. It is  difficult to get agreement among the various parents&rsquo; groups from the three  primary schools about which site to select.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If we identify a site, I would like the Minister to  indicate whether the new primary school will have to go through another process  or whether the Belfast Education and Library Board will be able to enter into  the procurement process. That is a key issue for the communities of Sandy Row,  Donegall Road and Lisburn Road.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If we can get the type of investment that we seek in that  area, I anticipate that we can get a similar response to that experienced by  Finaghy Primary School, which was built and opened about three years ago. It  has a tremendous track record as regards success and support.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Another issue is the plight of Newtownbreda Primary School.  As Dr McDonnell said, there is a problem where we hit the division between the  South Eastern Education and Library Board and the Belfast Education and Library  Board. As Members are probably aware, the primary school is effectively  surrounded by two major roads &mdash; the Knock dual carriageway and the Saintfield  Road. The number of pupils attending Newtownbreda Primary School has decreased;  therefore, any amalgamation that is being proposed will mean that the school&rsquo;s  pupils will have to travel across one of the busiest roads in Belfast.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must try to find a way forward to give comfort to  parents of pupils at the school. However, the South Eastern Education and  Library Board&rsquo;s announcement about the strong possibility of the amalgamation  of Rosetta and Newtownbreda primary schools has had an effect on pupil numbers  at Newtownbreda. I understand that the number of P1 pupils enrolled at  Newtownbreda is dramatically down this year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That is one of those unfortunate responses: if there is a  question mark over a school, that school immediately becomes unviable. There  must be a clear indication of the way forward on what is happening with Rosetta  and Newtownbreda schools. The South Eastern Board is looking at amalgamation  around the Knockbreda area, and I understand that one of the proposals is the  amalgamation of Knockbreda and Lisnasharragh schools. That is not logical to  me; however, it is one of the issues that I would be interested in receiving  further information on.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those are the schools that are under the worst threat, not  least because of investment but also because of the fabric of the buildings.  The post-primary schools in South Belfast &mdash; Malone College, Aquinas Grammar  School, Hunterhouse College, Methodist College, Victoria College &mdash; on the other  hand are fully subscribed, if not oversubscribed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">One of the greatest needs of inner South Belfast is for a secondary  school that is within reach of the local population &mdash; children are being bussed  to and from school all the time. One of the problems with bussing was that if  one were to go over a certain distance &mdash; three miles from one&rsquo;s home &mdash; one  would not get transport. Ironically, that was one of the reasons that the new  school on Blacks Road failed: its core catchment areas in inner South Belfast  were just outside the three-mile limit. All those pupils &mdash; whose parents came  from the most disadvantaged homes &mdash; had to pay for their transport. That was  one of the contributory factors in the closure of that school. I argued at the  time, along with others, that the school was being built in the wrong place; it  should have been built in inner south Belfast.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Communities in inner South Belfast need a new secondary  school; that is a constant. Taughmonagh school is a model for the way forward;  I am not sure what is happening with Newtownbreda and Rosetta schools or what  the way forward is for them. The way forward for inner South Belfast &mdash; for the  Donegall Road, Blythefield and Taughmonagh &mdash; will be in identifying a suitable  site. That can be done through the redevelopment of the Village area, which we  support through the Greater Village Regeneration Trust. Once we have identified  a site and reached agreement among parents, I would hate for there to be a  delay in the procurement. I would be grateful for an indication from the  Minister as to the likelihood of that.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm p&aacute;irt a ghlacadh sa  d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo ar ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; oideachais i ndeisceart Bh&eacute;al Feirste.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am glad to participate in this debate on education  matters in South Belfast, and I have listened carefully to Members&rsquo; points. It  seems that many proposals for new buildings and renovations in South Belfast  are stuck in the morass of antiquated procedures of the Department of  Education&rsquo;s building section, awaiting final approval. They may not see the  light of day during this financial year, which means that the money earmarked  for those projects may not be spent. It would be regrettable if millions of  pounds were to go back to the Department of Finance and Personnel at the end of  this financial year. That money could be lost to education if delays in processing  proposals are not eradicated. The Department of Education may have to bid to  recover that money, but there is no guarantee that the money will return to  education.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Delays are causing untold frustration in schools and  communities in South Belfast and elsewhere, as we have heard, where communities  have been waiting for years for newbuilds and renovations to begin. That  difficulty is not confined to one particular sector; it is experienced in the  controlled, maintained, integrated and Irish-medium sectors. All sectors agree  that those procedures must be changed without delay.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Education has told the Education  Committee that it is working on streamlining procurement procedures; however, I  think that more needs to be done. Some proposals have been in the system for  over four years and have still not emerged at the other end. Take, for example,  the new Holy Cross College in Strabane; it took seven years to develop that  proposal and only 22 months to build the school &mdash; in my view, that is totally  crazy. The Minister has been made aware of the problem by the Education  Committee and, I am sure, by those whose projects are stuck in the system. I  ask her to address that problem as a matter of urgency and to ensure that the  processing of proposals proceeds at pace without the long delays now inherent  in the system. That is something that ought to be done, and can be done,  without the investment of huge &mdash; if any &mdash; extra resources; it is a matter of  organisational change.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My colleague Dr McDonnell referred to the condition of the  schools estate in South Belfast. Quite honestly, the point he made was hardly  surprising when I recall that there is a &pound;217 million backlog in schools&rsquo;  maintenance. That is not my figure; three weeks ago that figure was given to the  Education Committee by departmental officials. A huge backlog in high-priority  school maintenance must be affecting the standard of accommodation in which our  children are being taught, and their health and safety. The Department has put  in a bid for &pound;10 million in the monitoring round because that would:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;slow down the deterioration of the schools estate and  reduce health and safety risks&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If the health and safety of children is at risk, the  Department of Education must have that money this year. I have sought more  detailed information on that, which I will no doubt receive in the future.  However, I am sure that Member&rsquo;s will agree; &pound;217 million of maintenance is a  huge figure, the equivalent in maintenance to the building of six large  secondary schools or 10 new primary schools. What does that say about the  fabric of our schools estate, not only in South Belfast, but overall? Given  that huge backlog, I ask the Minister to assure us that children are being  taught in buildings that are fit for purpose and in conditions that are healthy  and safe. The Department of Finance and Personnel needs to come up with that  &pound;10 million, and more if there are issues of health and safety to be brought  into the equation. Education needs extra funding to meet the spiralling costs  of heating oil and school meals. Without that extra funding &mdash; &pound;17 million &mdash;  education and library boards will be faced with making cuts. I am sure that we  all agree that the last thing that we want is cuts in education that will  affect front-line services.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The primary-school principals who are here today are no  doubt aware that in South Belfast, and, indeed, elsewhere, a primary-school  pupil attracts &pound;2,045 of funding per annum. In that same constituency, and  every other constituency, secondary-school pupils attract &pound;3,303 of funding and  sixth-form pupils attract &pound;5,000 of funding.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">5.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are five reasons that secondary school pupils in  South Belfast attract more funding than primary school pupils in that  constituency. Secondary schools need smaller classes for certain subjects;  their teachers are afforded 10% preparation, planning and assessment time; and,  in some subjects, secondary school pupils need specialist accommodation, as  well as specialist equipment and support staff.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Primary school pupils in South Belfast do not attract the  same level of funding as their secondary school counterparts because they are  taught in large class groups; their teachers do not get 10% preparation,  planning and assessment time; and, in many cases, they do not have the  specialist accommodation or equipment needed in order to implement the revised  curriculum &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member please bring his remarks to a close?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  I agree with previous speakers that huge issues in South Belfast need to be  addressed. Many of those issues are, however, replicated across the education  system. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education (Ms Ruane)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I  welcome Alasdair McDonnell&rsquo;s bringing forward this very useful Adjournment  debate, and the tone of his contribution. There was a marked difference in tone  between the proposer and seconder, but that is par for the course and is  probably part of a familiar pattern.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to thank the principals of different schools in  South Belfast that I have visited and who have invited me to visit. I will be  going to some of those schools in the near future, and I look forward to that.  I want to pay tribute to the principals, parents, boards of governors, teachers  and classroom assistants who do tremendous work. Alasdair McDonnell has kindly  asked me to meet some of them to have a chat after the debate. I am happy to do  that, and I hope that other MLAs from South Belfast will join me in meeting  them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am on record as recognising fully the problems with the  conditions and facilities at a number of schools, and not in just South Belfast  but right across the North. That is a legacy of underinvestment in the schools  estate in earlier decades, which we inherited and need to address. I will not  deal today with every query that Members raised about every school. However, I  will ask my officials to go through the Hansard report and to write to Members  regarding the schools that they mentioned. I share Members&rsquo; concerns about the  situation, and I am committed to dealing with it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Programme for Government includes the objective:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;To provide modern school facilities which meet the  needs for teaching and learning&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The investment strategy for the next 10 years sets out  ambitious plans for new investment in the schools estate, to create modern  infrastructure for schools and youth services to tackle the backlog of  underinvestment, and to provide facilities appropriate for the twenty-first  century.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Under the investment strategy, some &pound;3&middot;5 billion worth of  investment over the next 10 years has been identified for education, with  approximately 100 major work schemes to be advanced in the next three years  alone. That reflects the recognition by me, and by the Executive, of the  importance of modern, fit-for-purpose facilities for teaching and learning. I  have ensured that equality and social inclusion will be part of those  procurement processes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Irish-medium sector faces particular problems, with  many of its schools in poor-quality, temporary accommodation. That, too, is the  case in the South Belfast constituency. That was highlighted during the  Irish-medium education-policy review, which is soon to be released. Urgent  steps must be taken to address that sector&rsquo;s accommodation difficulties.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In delivering significant investment in sustainable schools  in the coming years, appropriate planning, procurement and delivery  arrangements must be in place.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A more strategic approach to estate planning, through  area-based plans, will help to identify more fully educational needs in local  areas, and how they might best be met. The policy for area-based planning is  the subject of consultation. Modern, stream-lined procurement arrangements that  can efficiently and effectively deliver the required capital investment must  also be established. As I have said, equality and social inclusion will be part  of that capital investment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department has taken steps with the education sector to  improve the processes. A new education and skills authority would have the central  role in modernising the estate in future and would work with all education  sectors to assess needs and deliver approved schemes. I look forward to my  colleagues in all parties working with me to fast-track the review of public  administration and the establishment of the education and skills authority.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The planned capital investment will help to address the  major infrastructure deficiencies and improve facilities in the coming year.  Pressing maintenance requirements must also be addressed. Under the local  management of schools funding arrangements, the relevant education and library  board has responsibility for landlord maintenance &mdash; structural-type repairs and  maintenance &mdash; of controlled and maintained schools in its area. Individual  schools are responsible for tenant maintenance, which includes internal  decoration, heating and lighting, cleaning and caretaking, and the upkeep of  grounds.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As part of the education and library boards&rsquo; block grant,  they receive funding specifically for high-priority maintenance pressures. In  the current financial year, some &pound;18 million has been allocated for that. In  order to provide boards with the flexibility to manage their budgets and to  respond to local needs and priorities, the maintenance budget is one of several  budgets that are not earmarked by the Department. As a consequence of other  emerging pressures, the amount of funding that is spent on maintenance has not  been sufficient to make inroads into the backlog that exists in the education  estate. It is important that priority is given to maintenance work to reduce  the deterioration of the estate and to reduce health and safety risks. We must  ensure that sufficient resources are available to do that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The common funding formula allocations, which are delegated  to each school, are designed to cover all essential expenditure on items that  must be met from the school&rsquo;s budget. The premises factor allocates resources  to schools to enable them to meet their tenant-maintenance obligations for the  management of school buildings. In 2008-09, the total formula funding that was  allocated to controlled and maintained schools in the South Belfast area was  just over &pound;16&middot;7 million, an increase of 7&middot;3% over the 2007-08 funding levels.  That amounts to an increase of 6&middot;1% per capita, after an increase in  funded-pupil numbers for schools in the area of 1&middot;1% is taken into account.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The allocation of a school&rsquo;s budget is determined by its  board of governors and principal, who are best placed to make decisions on  relevant priorities and the most effective use of resources in accordance with  the school&rsquo;s needs. It is, therefore, for the schools to determine the level of  expenditure that they wish to make on tenant maintenance. I recognise the  challenges facing primary-school principals, and I fully accept the value and  vital role of early intervention in preventing or reducing later difficulties.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My officials and I have had several meetings with  representative bodies about the funding of primary schools. From my visits to  schools and correspondence that I have received, I am aware of the feelings  about the resources that are provided to primary schools, particularly in  comparison with post-primary schools. It must also be recognised, however, that  the Department is working with finite overall resources. I welcome the fact  that some Members have said that they will support me in looking for additional  resources.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Of the &pound;20&middot;4 million uplift to schools&rsquo; budgets between  2008-09 and 2007-08, some &pound;12&middot;7 million was directed to primary schools,  representing an overall cash uplift of over 3%, and over 4% for each pupil. The  average increase per pupil for primary schools for 2008-09 is &pound;102, which is  higher than the average increase per pupil for post-primary schools.  Significant resources are also being made available to primary schools outside  the current funding formula arrangements.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Over the next three years, an additional &pound;32 million,  including &pound;7 million in the financial year 2008-09, will be made available to  support primary schools in their delivery of the foundation stage of the  revised curriculum. That additional funding will provide, for the first time,  access to classroom assistants for every pupil in year 1 and year 2. In the  same period, a further &pound;12 million will be available specifically to help to  ensure that, from September 2008, principals of smaller primary schools will be  released from teaching duties for at least two days each week.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the fact that academic selection and the transfer  procedure were mentioned today. People will see that the House is divided on  the issue. I welcome the support from this side of the House for the abolition  of academic selection. From my many meetings with primary-school teachers, I  know that they support the new arrangements. They are glad to know that the  curriculum will no longer be distorted. Primary-school principals from all  sectors told me how it broke their hearts to see how the transfer test affected  all children, and particularly those who were told that they had failed.  Failure can be dressed up in fancy words, but the children understand the  message that the exam sends.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the recent report from the United Nations  Convention on the Rights of the Child, which recommends the end of academic  selection. I also welcome the input of the Children&rsquo;s Commissioner in the North  and of those in England, Scotland and Wales. As Members know, the South of  Ireland does not, fortunately, have a system of academic selection.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The changes are under way, and progress is being made. The  revised primary curriculum is in operation and will no longer be distorted. The  transitional arrangements that I will introduce do not require pupils to sit a  test in primary schools. Therefore, 2008 is, fortunately, the last year of the  11-plus, and many principals and educationalists across the board welcome that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I also welcome the fact that Alasdair McDonnell, and  others, raised the issue of newcomer children. According to the 2007 school  census, 592 newcomer children attended schools in South Belfast, which is 10%  of the pupils throughout the North. In recent years, my Department has taken  specific action to ensure that schools have the necessary support to teach  newcomer children. Specifically, resources are provided to schools and, for  South Belfast, those amounted to more than &pound;500,000.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Schools also received support from the inclusion and  diversity service that was established in April 2007. Its diversity  co-ordinators provide direct help to cluster groups of schools. In conjunction  with one of my counterparts in the South of Ireland, Conor Lenihan, the  Minister with responsibility for integration policy, I launched a diversity  toolkit that was sent to primary schools across the island. I also launched a  parents&rsquo; website on the education sector in the North that is available in 16  languages. The Catholic maintained sector also launched a valuable website.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am conscious that I am approaching the end of my allotted  time, but I have a couple of final comments. In recent years, two primary  schools in South Belfast, Cranmore Integrated Primary School and Finaghy  Primary School, received new school buildings, and St Ita&rsquo;s at Carryduff on the  edge of South Belfast is a new school that opened in 2006. As Michael McGimpsey  mentioned, building at Taughmonagh Primary School is expected to start next  year, and targeting social need in all communities is one of my Department&rsquo;s  key strategic objectives. Minor works were recently completed, or are under  way, at several other schools in the area. Earlier this year, I approved a  nursery unit with 26 full-time places for Scoil an Droichid.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh maith agat as an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo. I thank all  Members who contributed today, particularly Alasdair McDonnell, who secured the  debate.</p>
