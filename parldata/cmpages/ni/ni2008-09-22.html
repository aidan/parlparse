		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The Assembly met at 12 noon (Mr Speaker in the  Chair).</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
		    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="1"></a>Private Members&rsquo; Business</p>
		    <p class="H4StageHeading">Town Centres and PPS 5</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30 minutes for  the debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes to propose and 10  minutes to make a winding-up speech, and all other Members who wish to speak  will have five minutes. One amendment has been selected and published on the  Marshalled List. The proposer of the amendment will have 10 minutes to propose  and five minutes to make a winding-up speech.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  beg to move</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly notes with concern the impact that  out-of-town retail centres can have on the viability of town centres; and calls  on the Minister of the Environment to publish and implement PPS 5.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My party colleagues and I have two reasons for welcoming  the fact that the motion was selected for debate. First, retailing and  town-centre planning policy greatly impacts on the shape of town centres,  which, in turn, affects citizen&rsquo;s lives.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, the updating of planning regulations on retail  outlets in town centres and commercial leisure developments has become a  drawn-out, almost never-ending saga that has entered the realms of farce.  Today&rsquo;s debate must spell out what has happened to the new retail planning  policy and when draft revised Planning Policy Statement 5 (PPS 5) will be  implemented.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A brief history of draft revised PPS 5 will enlighten  Members. Planning policy statements are policies on land use and other planning  matters. They set out the main planning considerations that planners take into  account when assessing individual planning applications.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The current planning policy for retail outlets in town  centres is set out in PPS 5, which is titled &lsquo;Retailing and Town Centres&rsquo;. That  document was published in June 1996. Significant changes have taken place since  then. Members need only think of towns in their constituencies to get an idea  of how many new supermarkets and out-of-town shopping centres have been built  since 1996.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">If one takes that into consideration, it will be easy to  appreciate that PPS 5 is now badly out of date. Although PPS 5 originally made  noises about the importance of sustaining and enhancing town centres in an:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;efficient, competitive and innovative retail sector&rdquo;,</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">it was, and is, widely criticised as being weak and  ineffective.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">To quote from another place:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;after several judicial reviews and other legal  challenges, PPS5, which was meant to protect town centres, was so watered down  that it was almost meaningless and certainly did not protect town centres.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Those are our Minister of the Environment&rsquo;s words, spoken  at Westminster.  I hope that he still believes what he said then and will be implementing the  new policy as soon as possible.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In 2000, the then Minister for Regional Development,  Gregory Campbell, announced a major policy review of PPS 5, which was expected  to take between 18 months and two years to complete. During that period,  however, we reverted to direct rule. Some three years later, on 5 February  2003, in answer to a parliamentary question, the then Minister with  responsibility for the environment, Angela Smith MP, said:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The final draft report of the retail consultancy is  due to be issued within the next few days.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I remind Members that that was in 2003. She went on to say:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The new draft planning policy statement is scheduled  to be issued for full public consultation during the next few months.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Of course, that did not happen.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Later, the Northern Ireland Independent Retail Trade  Association (NIIRTA), in its report &lsquo;Nightmare on Every Street&rsquo; &mdash; I recommend  Members either acquire a copy or view it on the NIIRTA website &mdash; stated that  the Department had advised it that the draft revised PPS 5 would be published  in September 2004. Again, that did not happen. It was July 2006 before draft  revised PPS 5 was produced and put out to consultation, which was to last until  November of that year.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Then, on 15 January 2008, the Department of the Environment  (DOE) assumed responsibility for draft revised PPS 5 from the Department for  Regional Development (DRD). However, in April, there was a legal challenge to  that, and the issue is currently before the High Court. I hope that our courts  and the Department will ensure that the matter can be dealt with expediently so  that no further undue delays to the long overdue policy change occur.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In an answer to an Assembly question for written answer  that I submitted, published on 4 July this year, the Minister confirmed that  the consultation period ended on 3 November 2006, but that draft revised PPS 5  is:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;currently subject to Judicial Review and will be  published as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome such comments from the Minister, and I ask that  he and his Department ensure that no more delays emanate from that Department,  that the final delay in this lengthy process is the court decision, and that  all other issues are resolved, excluding any court decisions that may have to  be taken into consideration.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Programme for Government, which has been approved by  the Assembly, states:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;It is clear that climate change is one of the most  serious problems facing the world. While we recognise that it requires action  internationally, we are determined to play our part in addressing this  challenge by reducing our impact on climate change.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Given the Minister&rsquo;s rather eccentric view that man has not  been contributing to climate change, he may need to clarify his view. In  particular, he should clarify whether he remains committed to the Programme for  Government on the issue, and whether he accepts that implementing draft revised  PPS 5 would assist the Planning Service and the Northern Ireland Executive in  delivering the commitments that they made in the Programme for Government.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is now some eight years since Gregory Campbell announced  the policy review. That is a ridiculous length of time to develop a new policy.  I am not a conspiracy theorist, although others do not share my lack of  cynicism &mdash; some people do believe in conspiracies, and not just climate-change  conspiracies.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Speaking in a Westminster Hall debate on Northern Ireland  planning on 1 November 2005, our present Minister of the Environment, when  talking about research undertaken by Roger Tym and Partners, said:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The report, which was published in February 2003,  indicated that the Northern    Ireland food market was reaching saturation  point, with growth down from 1.28 per cent. to less than half that figure.  Obviously, that did not suit some people in the Department, because at that  stage there was an influx of major food retailers such as Tesco, Sainsbury&rsquo;s  and ASDA into Northern Ireland.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">That report was published in 2003, yet there has been a  huge number of out-of-town shopping centres developed since then. Therefore,  the balance has shifted.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Indeed, in that same debate, our current Minister of the  Environment went on to say:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The document was delayed, but it now seems to have  fallen off the radar completely.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Again, I ask the Minister to examine carefully how the  development of a huge number of out-of-town shopping centres has been allowed  to happen since that date. Clearly, there is an urgent need for a review of  that policy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Perhaps when he is summing up, the Minister will reveal  whether his planning department is still &mdash; metaphorically &mdash; in bed with the  multinational retailers, which is something that he hinted at some three years  ago.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">To a lay person, draft PPS 5, which was published in 2006,  seems to be a clear and concise document. Draft PPS 5 proposes a more stringent  approach to retail development in town centres and out-of-town locations. It  also ensures a restriction on commercial leisure development beyond town  centres.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The proposed sequential approach would ensure that town  centres are considered as the first possible location for new developments,  thereby contributing to their sustainability and regeneration. The draft &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  Is the Member saying that he is against out-of-town development and competition  coming into Northern Ireland?  People are encouraged to see the major retailers coming to Northern Ireland,  especially when those large retailers make the press on the issue of their fuel  prices. Indeed, another large retailer that has been consistent with its fuel  prices is attempting to come into the Province.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">With the credit crunch and the current status of the  market, is the Member against that competition?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  The Member has not listened to what I said. In support of the draft policy,  there should be an increased, stringent requirement to consider seriously  locations in existing town centres. That does not rule out development  elsewhere. However, it places a greater onus on those who wish to develop  outside of town centres to provide a stringent case as to why that proposed  development cannot be developed in town centres.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The policy has changed in Great Britain, and it is shown to  have assisted in securing town centres. Perhaps the Member wants town centres  with vacant shops.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My colleague Mr Cree will refer to the difficulties that have  arisen in the Bangor  area following the development of a significant number of out-of-town shopping  centres. Balance is important in all of this, and the new policy will provide  that.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr W McCrea</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  No, my time is nearly up. I hope that the Minister will also ensure that no  further delays emanate from his Department.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>: I  beg to move the following amendment: Insert after the second &ldquo;centres&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;, whilst recognising the benefit to the Northern Ireland  retail sector of some development of regional significance&rdquo;.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Although I have proposed the amendment, I have some  sympathy with the motion. The issue of how we keep small businesses and, more  importantly, businesses in town centres must be addressed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There are some shocking statistics. For example, over 2,000  local shops close each year, and there are issues about how to make and keep  those shops sustainable in town centres. Furthermore, over 50,000 businesses  will go out of business by 2015. Therefore, we need to take a more balanced  approach to the whole aspect of where shopping facilities are developed in town  centres.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The other aspect of moving to out-of-town centres is that &mdash;  and I know that the Minister could not possibly disagree with me &mdash; burning more  fossil fuels and increasing one&rsquo;s carbon footprint contributes, in some way, to  climate change. That would never do. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  Does the Member agree that there has been a significant climate change, in that  the DUP won the seat in Fermanagh and trounced the Ulster Unionist Party very  well?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>:  Yes, there is definitely some sort of carbon footprint all over Fermanagh at  the minute.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On a more serious note, we must take issue with where and  how we develop town centres. We must recognise the economic and social benefits  of developing our town centres. However, do we do that at the expense of a lack  of competition in the retail sector and, more importantly, without recognising  areas of regional significance? That is why I have introduced this amendment.  Three areas of regional significance are identified in the proposed PPS 5: Belfast city centre; Londonderry  city centre; and one non-city regional centre, Sprucefield.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a need for such out-of-town regional centres. It  is unreasonable to make the argument that anyone will shop every week in the  likes of IKEA; that is impossible. People will travel long distances to places  such as IKEA once or twice a year. I have no difficulty with the fact that we  have an IKEA store in Belfast.  People were travelling to Scotland  by the busload and taking much-needed finance out of the Northern Ireland economy before the store came  to Belfast. We  need those businesses in our regional centres.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Three areas are recognised for their regional significance. Does the Member  believe that other areas &mdash; possibly in the west &mdash; should be designated for  their regional significance?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>:  Those are the three areas identified under draft PPS 5. It is up to the  Minister to decide whether any new areas should be added, or for the Member to  take up the matter with the Minister.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Some businesses are needed in the regional centres, and one  controversial business is John Lewis, which has made up its mind to go to  Sprucefield or nowhere else in Northern    Ireland. The same argument applies to John  Lewis as does to IKEA. People are continually taking cheap flights to England to spend their money, and that  hard-earned money should be spent in the economy of Northern Ireland. John Lewis is  needed at Sprucefield, and it is talking about bringing 1,500 much-needed jobs  to Northern Ireland.  Will that be to the detriment of some of the local businesses? I doubt that.  People have already made their choice and have travelled and spent their money  in John Lewis stores in the UK.  It is better to keep that business in the Northern Ireland economy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Another issue &mdash; and no Member will disagree with this &mdash; is  that we need construction jobs to kick-start the construction industry in Northern Ireland.  John Lewis would be a major investment of over &pound;200 million, and Northern Ireland  sorely needs that investment at this time in view of the crisis in the world  economy. Can we afford not to have John Lewis in Northern Ireland? In light of the  current situation, the answer is no, as that business would be drained out of  the Northern Ireland  economy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We have an amazing planning system in Northern Ireland.  There has been a five-year delay on the John Lewis development, and that delay  &mdash; whether we like it or not &mdash; is costing Northern Ireland. It has cost us  200 jobs so far.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Of the 900 jobs that John Lewis originally proposed to  create, only 700 remain. The five-year delay has cost 200 jobs, and it will  cost many more. The proposed 1,500 jobs will not be available if we continue on  the road down which we are going. A decision must be made about that particular  planning matter. However, a decision must also be made about draft revised  Planning Policy Statement 5. That is the end of my little rant about John  Lewis. However, there are significant regional centres where regional  businesses such as John Lewis and IKEA must be placed.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr W McCrea</strong>:  I accept that regional centres should be developed in their own right. However,  towns such as Antrim have, in many ways, been decimated by out-of-town shopping  centres. We must be very careful. It is essential that we put life back into  town centres, and planning policy can assist that.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>:  That is why I stated that a balanced approach is required and why I had no  great problem with the motion. However, we must take cognisance of the fact  that regional businesses need a regional centre. A more balanced approach on  town centres is required.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I thank the Member for saying that he has no particular difficulty with the  motion. Will he explain to the House how the amendment would benefit the  motion? What is missing from the motion that the amendment will add?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>: It  seems that the Member has difficulty in listening to what people say in the  House. I have stated several times that regional businesses must be located in  regional centres. Does the Member argue that Belfast,  Londonderry and Sprucefield should not be  designated as regional centres? That suggestion would not be received politely  in those areas.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>:  No, I have very little time left.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">That is why I moved the amendment that the Assembly accept  that regional centres be allocated in draft revised Planning Policy Statement 5  when it is implemented.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I welcome the Speaker back after the  recess.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Tyrone is also undergoing serious climatic change, and I  congratulate the county on winning the all-Ireland senior football championship  for a third time.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Members who have brought the motion to the  Chamber. Sinn F&eacute;in understands the reasons for raising the issue and  sympathises with the sentiments that have been expressed. Smaller retailers  have genuine fears that they will be squeezed out by multinationals building  superstores on the outskirts of towns.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Draft revised PPS 5 recognises Belfast,  Derry and Sprucefield as regional shopping  facilities and aims to direct new retail developments of regional significance  to those areas. That will help to attract major new investment to the region in  a way that will also sustain and enhance town centres in the North.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The draft policy promotes the primary retail core of the  other cities and towns as first choice for the location of new retail  developments, but it must also reflect the Programme for Government&rsquo;s  commitment to tackling regional disparities. The valuable and enjoyable  shopping experience of existing thriving town centres will be sustained, and  existing town-centre businesses will reap the benefits of increased trade from  a higher footfall in the town and city centres.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in acknowledges and supports the contribution of  small-to-medium traditional businesses, many of which are family-run. Those  businesses make up the vast majority of the retail sector here, and they enhance  the economy greatly. Many people feel that the implementation of a policy to  protect our town centres from becoming ghost towns is long overdue, especially  in the current economic climate, when many job losses in the retail sector are  feared.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in believes that any policy that is implemented must  ensure that small businesses can play their part to bolster not only the  economic vibrancy, but the social fabric of our towns and cities. The draft  policy makes provision for retail development in those towns and cities that  cannot accommodate large retail development in their centres due to historical  or heritage constraints or lack of suitable sites. That will allow towns and  cities that wish to expand the retail sector and challenge similar-sized competitors  for a share of the market base to do so, which will, in turn, attract shoppers  to the nearby primary retail core.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Any policy that is published must be capable of being  implemented. It must allow our urban areas the capacity for economic growth,  while protecting the vitality and viability of our existing town centres.  Ultimately, it must benefit the consumer by offering best value for money.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, we recognise the need for the publication  and implementation of PPS 5, as called for in the motion. However, we must also  ensure that, under the current reform of the planning system &mdash; which was  initiated by the previous Minister of the Environment &mdash; measures are put in  place and proper guidance is provided for local government to protect town centres  and existing businesses while achieving the necessary economic growth. Go raibh  maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>:  When a motion of this type first came before the Assembly on 2 October 2000 &mdash; a  long time ago &mdash; it was enthusiastically voted down by the DUP and some Ulster  Unionists. We were given a lecture by Ian Paisley Jnr on natural market forces.  Nothing was said about balanced communities or the excesses of the  multinationals. The present Minister of the Environment made a contribution at  that time, too &mdash; he told us that one can buy Tayto crisps at Tesco in  Knocknagoney.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Today, there appears to be a realisation in both parties  that there is a need to regulate out-of-town shopping centres in a manner that  provides for some sense of reality and acknowledges that those shopping centres  wipe out our town centres, promote degeneration and leave the most vulnerable  people with no shops, no banks and no post offices. Eight years on, post  offices are now an endangered species. The whole process of killing off  businesses in villages and small towns is already well under way. Members  should know that, in Britain, more than 60% of villages and sizeable towns are  left with no shopping facilities at all &mdash; not a single shop is left; no bank,  no post office, no pharmacy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A couple of years ago, I visited a town in Ohio called  Ashtabula. I am sure that most people have never heard of it, and I cannot  think of any good reason why they should have. The shops are mostly closed, as  they have all fallen victim to out-of-town shopping malls. There are still a  couple of pubs, and, as it was St Patrick&rsquo;s Day, I decided to have a tipple. I  met a man who claimed that he was a direct descendant of an Indian tribe. He  was a nice individual who told me that his wife had gone to do the shopping. When  I asked him whether he was expecting her back soon, he told me that shopping  was a two-day event. His wife had to stop overnight at her sister&rsquo;s house  because it was too far to make the journey in one day. That is the reality of  out-of-town shopping centres, and if legislation is not introduced soon, we  will head down the same dreary road.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, we cannot put all the blame on the planners. If  the opening of a new multinational store were to be announced today, I know  Members who would be scrambling for airtime to welcome the hundreds of new jobs  promised. Yet does anyone ever try to research the impact on the hundreds of  people who will lose their jobs as a direct result of such developments? I do  not think so. Does anyone attempt to evaluate the jobs on offer? How many of  them offer the minimum wage? Has any research been carried out on the impact on  family life as pressure is exerted on employees to work antisocial hours away  from family and loved ones? I think not.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Those matters must be controlled in a way that creates a  level playing field and curtails the power of the big retailers that do not  care about local communities &mdash; their only interest is in sending the profits  back home. Those profits do not circulate locally, and such development does little  to promote other businesses.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In recent times, multinationals have made an interesting  switch from groceries to drapery, electrical goods, banking, insurance, and  anything else that fills their shelves. Yet &mdash; and I hope that Sammy Wilson is  listening &mdash; a small business in the countryside cannot get off the ground  because of PPS 14, which bans development in the countryside. Not only is there  no control over the size of the multinationals, but there is a bias against  local people who wish to start up their own businesses. Even inoffensive  advertising signs, which cause no harm to anyone, are being taken down, and the  business people who erected them are being dragged through the courts.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It has been eight years since the issue was first debated  in the Chamber. That is too long to wait for action if we are serious about  retaining our town centres and villages. If we do not take action now, we will  end up with a situation similar to that in Ashtabula.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I,  too, welcome the motion. As John Dallat said, there is a significant difference  between the attitudes expressed in the Chamber this morning and those expressed  when we last discussed the issue.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The present retail planning policy in Northern Ireland is  around 20 years behind that in Great Britain, and Roy Beggs outlined some of  the reasons that have led to that delay. I am sure that all Members can provide  examples of excessive commercial development, specifically in the retail  sector, outside historic towns across Northern Ireland, rather than it being  used to regenerate town centres and to promote a more sustainable future. One  only needs to look elsewhere in the world to see that if we do not modify our  planning policies soon, we will go down a very dangerous road and encounter  serious problems.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Economic activity varies in historic market towns across  the region. Such activity overwhelmingly relates to whether there has been  modern shopping development in those town centres, or whether it has been  displaced to out-of-town sites. If one looks at comparisons between Ballymena,  Omagh, Newry and Downpatrick, one will see different activities taking place  inside and outside the core centre. In almost every case, developments that are  situated in town centres have thriving social lives and economies, but  developments that are situated predominantly outside town centres experience  the complete reverse.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I named Omagh and Newry among the list of market towns, and  I was amazed that Cathal Boylan, as an Armagh man, referred to Tyrone winning a  certain match at Croke Park yesterday afternoon. As Lord Morrow has  disappeared, Mr Bresland has not mentioned it, and most of the Tyrone Members  are not here, perhaps I should flag up my Tyrone roots and congratulate the  team on its success. I apologise; Lord Morrow is in the Chamber.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There are real issues that must be addressed. We have  totally failed to ensure that we maintain the vibrancy of those towns and the  vibrancy of community life, which crosses over into other aspects.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I confess that I was slightly surprised by the wording of  the amendment. I wondered why it did not include the word &ldquo;Sprucefield&rdquo;,  because PPS 5 readily acknowledges that there is a regional case for it.  Planning Policy Statement 5 is designed to protect the integrity of district  towns across the whole of Northern Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Does the Member recognise that, under the current wording of the motion, the  IKEA development would have been turned down?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  am not sure whether that is entirely the case, but there is a significant  difference between IKEA-type developments &mdash; so-called roof-rack shopping &mdash; and  the difficulties that have arisen from out-of-town convenience shopping.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I reiterate the point that my constituency colleague from  South Antrim made: there are real differences between the shopping niches that  were originally outlined for Junction One and The OUTLET outside Banbridge and  those centres where retailers are given permission to add on normal convenience  shopping, which should be located in a town centre, rather than at a regional  or special-day-out centre.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Planning policy has completely failed to learn that lesson  by first allowing some of those developments to proceed and then changing the  internal nature of those developments. Those points are relevant when it comes  to Sprucefield, but they are also relevant to the way in which other centres  are used in other places.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On that basis, I welcome the points that were made  specifically about the strategic nature of town centre development. The draft  revised PPS 5 contains key points, such as greater accessibility, the  protection of existing retail provision, the addition of other suitable town  centre uses and the promotion of urban renewal, whose implementation will be  vital if town centres are to be kept as living, working places. If we do not  address those points, and if we allow commercial activity to be driven out to  out-of-town centres, all sorts of other activity that characterise a town  centre will be lost.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  I presume that the Member has already made the same points that my colleague  from South Antrim Dr William McCrea made in relation to Antrim town. Will he  identify where Antrim town centre is and where the retail centre is, because  the town has not had one? The retail outlet at Tesco moved before Junction One  was opened.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: We  will debate the minutiae of Antrim town&rsquo;s edge-of-town or out-of-town centres  elsewhere. The Member has made a valid point, but what matters is the  difference between those places that have developed centres at the edge of  town, such as in Newry, and those that have done so completely out into the  countryside. There are two key aspects to the enhancement of town centres;  first, they promote the opportunity for shared space and a neighbourhood&rsquo;s  social cohesion; secondly, they are far more sustainable. That is something  that all of us, including the Minister of the Environment, should recognise.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>:  Politicians and the owners of small businesses across the Province have been  calling for the publication of the draft revised PPS 5 for many years. More  than ever, we are witnessing the increasing pressures that small and  medium-sized businesses in Northern Ireland are facing. We must recognise that  the vast majority of businesses in the Province are small. However, thousands  of people are employed by small and medium-sized businesses, many of which are  family-run and are the heart and soul of many local communities.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It has been predicted that many such businesses could be  lost over the next few years as they come under increasing pressure from larger  superstores and out-of-town shopping centres. The effect of that can be that  local shops close down, and residents must travel longer distances to buy basic  necessities such as milk and bread. There is little doubt that some towns and  villages across Northern Ireland are at risk of being gutted out, although the  premise of the motion &mdash; that all out-of-town shopping facilities are somehow  bad &mdash; is false.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the amendment tabled by my party colleagues from  Lagan Valley, which is more balanced in its recognition of the impact of some  out-of-town shopping developments.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  The Member should look carefully at the motion, which did not rule out &mdash; nor  did I in my comments &mdash; the potential development of some out-of-town shopping  centres. Town centre developments, or edge-of-town developments, which some  Members mentioned, could be more stringently assessed before greenfield sites  are chosen at separate locations. I ask the Member to reflect on that and not  to try to change the comments that I made.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I  welcome that clarification. It is important to point out that the amendment  mentions the development of sites of regional significance.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: No,  I will not give way again. I will allow the Member&rsquo;s colleagues to sum up  whatever he wants to say at the end of the debate.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the amendment, which is more balanced in its  recognition that some out-of-town shopping developments can be important for  the region and the locality. They can also be important to local people. We  must remember that many of our constituents want access to a range of products  at a competitive price at a location at which they can park easily. That is  particularly important now, as families face tighter economic pressures and  economic considerations are the top priority.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">If new facilities are handled correctly, many of them can  provide jobs for local people and generate economic prosperity for a certain  region. Members have mentioned many towns that could be under threat from out-of-town  developments, including Larne in my constituency.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There are plans for a large supermarket in Larne, near the  harbour. There will also be a bowling alley and a cinema as part of that  overall development. Far from being bad for the town, the development will  provide many desperately needed facilities. The majority of people in Larne  travel to Carrickfergus or Ballymena for their weekly shopping and go to  neighbouring towns for entertainment. It is better that they can buy their  weekly shopping in their own locality and have somewhere to go at weekends and  evenings, rather than leaving the town for both shopping and leisure.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: Is  the Member seriously suggesting that people from Larne travel to Ballymena &mdash;  two towns that have been grouped together in the new council boundaries &mdash; given  his previous assertions about how utterly disconnected the two towns are?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I  appreciate that it is a two-day trip, as Mr Dallat mentioned, and I shudder at  the thought of such a journey. However, it is important that people can shop in  their local area and that, where those facilities are not available, we should  be supporting efforts to make them available. It must also be recognised that  although major developments should be located in town centres, ideally, as  proposed in the draft revised PPS 5, it is often the case that the company in  question will decide where it wants to locate. It is then for the town to  decide whether to let the opportunity pass by.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I listened to the comments from the proposer of the  amendment, who made reference to the proposed John Lewis development in  Lisburn. In such a situation, when the choice is between Lisburn and Dublin, it  is fairly clear which will benefit the local region more. Nonetheless, it must  be recognised that town centres are under threat from large superstore  developments, and we do not want our town centres becoming deserted. It is,  therefore, important that the policy makes clear that out-of-town developments  should be avoided unless they bring something of particular significance or  importance to the local area or region or the development is not viable in a  town-centre location. The key is achieving the right balance between  safeguarding town centres and allowing major out-of-town developments that can  be of regional importance.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  Does the Member also accept that if too many restrictions are placed on  developments that are not accepted as regional centres, the viability of those  already in place could be affected?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I  concur with the Member&rsquo;s comments; they match some of the things that I have  said. In fairness, the aim of the policy is to ensure that town centres are  promoted as the first choice for such developments where possible: therefore,  Members should have no difficulty in supporting the amendment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department for Social Development (DSD) is also seeking  to regenerate many town centres, and it is important that DOE works with DSD to  prevent town centres being killed off before efforts to regenerate them can  begin. A blanket ban on out-of-town develop&shy;ments cannot be introduced, as that  may not always be in the best interests of local people or towns that may  benefit from such developments. I support the amendment.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the three Members for bringing  the motion to the House. It is vital that PPS 5 is published and implemented,  notwithstanding any legal difficulties, and that the Assembly demonstrates that  it is acting in the best interests of small and indigenous retail businesses.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Local retail businesses reinvest profits into the local  economy rather than taking them out, and they are much more likely to give  financial support to the local community, through sponsorship of local sports,  to take just one example.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">If Members have looked at the Northern Ireland Independent  Retail Trade Association&rsquo;s document, &lsquo;A Nightmare in Every Street&rsquo;, to which Mr  Beggs has already referred, they have seen that it shows that local food  schemes return 50% of turnover to the local economy compared to as little as 5%  from the much larger stores.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The inclusion in draft revised PPS 5 of the possible  adverse effects on the vitality and viability of existing town centres is to be  welcomed. The sustainability of the retail sector in towns and villages is an  issue that the Assembly must prioritise because that also has an impact on  those who supply the retail sector, local farmers being the prime example. The  draft revised policy identifies town centres as the first choice for new retail  developments and establishes a number of common-sense criteria for those  seeking to develop away from the retail core of a town or village.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Many town centres, some of which have been referred to, are  beginning to resemble ghost towns, and the smaller local hub towns are  particularly vulnerable to out-of-town development. Therefore, there is already  a need to examine economic regeneration in such areas to ensure that consumers  have a good variety and choice of services in their own community, on their own  doorsteps, rather than driving 10 or 20 miles to the bigger towns and cities.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In the South, retail planning guidelines similar to those  proposed were introduced as far back as the year 2000, which, in itself,  demonstrates how far behind we in the North really are, as other Members have  already mentioned.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">When we are talking about bringing more retail businesses  into town centres, we should be considering the traffic implications also. The  requirement for more park-and-ride schemes and better public transport to ease  the pressure on town centres should be incorporated into any future planning  policy.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">12.45 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The pressure on small retail businesses in our economy must  not be underestimated. In addition to pressure from multinational companies,  the businesses face competition from the new market of Internet shopping and  the increasing costs of overheads. A level playing field is needed, so the  sooner that PPS 5 is published and implemented, the better.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The planning policy statement has been left on the shelf by  direct rule Ministers for many years, and I hope that the Minister will provide  assurances that it will be implemented when the legal issues have been dealt  with, because many small businesses are already under severe pressure and are  trying to keep their heads above water. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>:  There was much press comment when the Minister of the Environment, Mr Wilson,  was appointed, and it overshadowed his first, and best, decision. Mr Wilson  turned down the planning application for a Tesco hypermarket at The OUTLET in Banbridge.  Like many public representatives, I welcomed that decision strongly. It was a  courageous decision, given the nature of the company involved and the huge  pressure that was on his Department to approve the planning application.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Why did I, and practically every other public  representative, welcome the decision, given that the new store, based on  Tesco&rsquo;s figures, would have had an income of &pound;72 million in its first year? We  welcomed the decision because that figure is more than the combined total annual  income of all the shops in Banbridge &mdash; the impact on the town would have been  enormous. That is an example of the problem that we face. In addition to &pound;72  million income, which many regard as a conservative estimate, there was  sufficient land on the site to double the size of the store at a later date. We  have discovered that, if the principle of a large out-of-town shopping complex  is accepted, it is almost impossible to resist applications for further  expansion, as is happening in Newry. The impact of a store that had the  capability of expanding would have been devastating to Banbridge, as similar  stores have been to other parts of South Down.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Thirty years ago, Rathfriland was a bustling rural town  that served the requirements of a wide hinterland. Today, many shops there are  empty, and all that is left are takeaways, charity shops and solicitors. Any  town that gets into that predicament is in difficulty. A drift of retail out of  Kilkeel has already begun, and it does not take a genius to see what is happening:  stand in any town in the South Down area on a Saturday morning and one will see  the traffic heading to Sprucefield, Forestside and Newry. The powerful  attraction of such shopping centres is leading to a loss of fabric in our small  towns.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I also represent Ballynahinch, where a major application  has been submitted for a large out-of-town shopping centre. Although the anchor  tenant is unknown, we suspect that it will be one of the large multinationals,  excluding Marks and Spencer and <span style="text-transform:uppercase; ">Asda</span>.  The impact of such a shopping centre will be phenomenal, because the town is  already showing severe signs of economic stress. It takes very little for a  trend of closure, where stores such as Iceland and SuperValu leave a town, to  become inexorable. Once that happens, the town is on the skids.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that there is a policy to provide guidance.  There was an application for a Tesco store in Ballycastle, which had more  square footage than all the retailers in Ballycastle and its surrounding towns  and villages combined. The impact of such a store on places such as Bushmills,  Armoy and Cushendun would have been enormous. Therefore, a consistent policy is  required. I understand the difficulties that the Minister faces, but tackling  that difficult issue must be one of his priorities.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am glad that, in Banbridge, when councillors met traders  and realised how much they would lose, they, at least, changed their minds.  Initially, they supported the application.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have become the patron saint of lost causes in Down  District Council. It voted in favour of the new superstore by 21 votes to one &mdash;  the one being my vote. Councillors see the pound signs on the large rates  cheques that will come in every year from one multinational food purveyor. They  do not see how that will result in gradual loss of income to the district as  shop after shop in the town closes and, therefore, no longer pay rates.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that councillors will have a bit of sense and  realise that it is absolutely vital to maintain the vibrancy of town centres  for future generations. The opening of big multinational stores is a quick fix  that must be avoided, because it ruins the special character of many of  Northern Ireland&rsquo;s towns.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>:  Much has been said during the debate about the market position that is enjoyed  by large multiple-retail businesses and about how their out-of-town centres  disadvantage small and medium-sized businesses, leading to the running down of  town centres and depletion of shopping facilities in local villages. Those  points are crucial and have been articulated well by my colleagues and other  Members. However, PPS 5 should also be considered alongside wider political and  economic concerns.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly must grapple with rapidly rising fuel and food  costs and how to ameliorate their impact in the short term, during the coming  winter, on the most vulnerable people in society. In the short term, fuel  prices have steadied and, in some cases, abated. Fierce competition has reduced  food prices. The hard fact that we must face, however, is that the era of cheap  food and fuel is over. Government and society will be forced to make  adjustments in order to accommodate the impact of that. How the Assembly shapes  the future will affect how people fare with increasing food and fuel bills in  the long term. The Assembly must help people to use less fuel and to eat  healthily with less money.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Where does PPS 5 come into that? It is tied in with the  trend towards high-density development in town centres, coupled with the drift  away from low-density out-of-town sites. That is reflected in the move away  from private to public transport, walking and cycling. In order to make that  happen, town centres must be regenerated and their daytime and evening  economies promoted. Bangor&rsquo;s town centre is an example of that, which has been  caused by what the Americans call the &ldquo;doughnut effect&rdquo;. In Bangor&rsquo;s case, it  is half a doughnut, because it is surrounded by the sea on one side. Many other  towns have been similarly affected, some of which have been mentioned in the  debate &mdash; Ballynahinch, Comber, Ballyclare, Omagh, and Larne, to name but a few.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Town centres already have the necessary public-transport  linkages to enable people to move away from increasingly costly private  transport. Northern Ireland has a significantly higher than average carbon  footprint. People here burn more fuel for each person than in other parts of  the UK, whether they consume that fuel directly or as electricity.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Irrespective of arguments on global warming and mankind&rsquo;s  contribution to it, fuel has become relatively expensive and is getting  scarcer. It costs more to heat a home and to get around. The Assembly must  facilitate the public in order to reduce their needs. PPS 5, which supports  town-centre regeneration and development, is essential to ensure that people do  not need to burn unnecessary fuel to heat their homes and to shop, and makes  living in easy reach of a town centre more attractive when that is set against  less dense and more remote housing.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Another factor that PPS 5 will buttress is freedom of  choice and flexible retail development throughout Northern Ireland. It ensures  that a wide range of shopping activities is open to the entire community. That  flexibility and access to a wide range of shopping activities maximises  comparison shopping &mdash; consumers can easily compare prices, quality and other  considerations when making purchases. A more competitive and less captive  retail environment leads to increases in the range and choice of goods. That is  at the very heart of the healthy operation of free competition; the mechanism  that ensures benefit to consumers. Out-of-town shopping centres benefit major  multiples precisely because that environment curtails comparison shopping and  enables the store to dictate the range and choice of goods. That acts to the  consumer&rsquo;s disadvantage.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">PPS 5 will improve the facility for comparison shopping and  add to the quality of life in our towns and cities. Additionally, it has the  potential to reinvigorate local communities through providing local services  and shops that are responsive to local people and can take their needs into  consideration. That has the potential to benefit the elderly and vulnerable, so  it should be welcomed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Let me be clear: we are not trying to exclude major retail  companies and developers, but, if we are to help the public to cope in the  longer term with more expensive fuel and food, we must enact those measures  that shape our built environment and infrastructure so that people can cope  better. Many of them will be in the hands of the Department of the Environment.  PPS 5 is a step along that road, and it should be implemented without further  delay. I support the motion and urge the Minister to take immediate action.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  support the motion and my colleagues&rsquo; amendment. I support the motion in spite  of some things that Members from other parties have said in support of it.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Explain.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  hear a cry of &ldquo;explain&rdquo; from Mr McCrea. I shall refer to a couple of remarks  that were made.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr W McCrea</strong>:  That was Basil.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  should have said &ldquo;Mr Basil McCrea&rdquo;, lest either of my colleagues of that name  be insulted.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Roy Beggs Jnr referred to conspiracy theories that would  fit in neatly with either &lsquo;The X Files&rsquo; or an Oliver Stone movie.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: Mr  Beggs has had his say. I have only a short time in which to speak.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We have also heard about the dreadful prospect of  cohabitation, which Mr Beggs has supposedly identified. Mr Dallat painted a  picture of working for a multinational company that was comparable to life in  the Gulag. People who have the misfortune to work for such companies are  evidently in some way detached from their families. It would appear to be akin  to working a six-month stint on an oil rig, with the destruction of family life  that that might entail.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">When it comes to having retail choices, we want to see fair  competition and a balanced approach to planning. It must be acknowledged that  out-of-town shopping centres provide a useful service to people. The volumes of  people who use those centres demonstrate that a demand for them exists.  Bangor&rsquo;s problems, which have already been mentioned in the debate, are well  documented. I am also aware that Bloomfield Shopping Centre and Retail Park and  Springhill Shopping Centre are geographically close to communities and have  made a major, positive contri&shy;bution to life in North Down. A balance must be  struck.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We cannot go down the line of draconian economic  protectionism that tries to shut out the real world and that, like some  latter-day King Canute, tries to pretend that we can turn back the waves. We  can, however, ensure that competition is fair, and fair competition lies at the  heart of draft revised PPS 5. It is not about banning all out-of-town shopping  centres but about creating an environment that benefits town centres. It gives  a preference to new developments in town centres and focuses activity there.  The reinvigoration of our town centres is vital.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mention was made of the effects of out-of-town shopping  centres on existing retailers. We should remember that, during the many years  of the Troubles, when many multinational companies would not even look at  Northern Ireland, mall traders kept the economy going.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: We  owe a debt of gratitude to those people.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Vital environmental and social components are needed in  order to reinvigorate town centres. All those issues must be taken into  account. In ensuring that town centres are reinvigorated, it is crucial that we  do not look only at draft revised PPS 5 and at planning issues but that we  ensure that there is joined-up government.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Consider Holywood in my constituency of North Down. Leaving  aside the long-running issue of Queen&rsquo;s Parade, the redevelopment of the town  centre and frontage is being held up at present by a legal dispute between DRD  and DSD over a car park. Some of the solutions are planning related and concern  retail, but others go beyond that and involve the provision of joined-up  government. We must cast the net wider.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In the final minute remaining to me, I shall speak to the  amendment.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">1.00 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is also the case that, whatever protection we afford  town centres and, indeed, however PPS 5 is framed, there are going to be  developments of major regional significance, which must be allowed for.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">John Lewis would be a welcome addition to Northern Ireland;  unfortunately it has been held up for too long. Look at the benefits of IKEA,  which is situated on the edge of North Down and Belfast. Although that type of  development causes some degree of displacement activity, it is geared at a  regional centre, which means that money that would otherwise be spent across  the water or down South is retained in Northern Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am strongly in favour of PPS 5. I am sure that the  Minster will outline the principal problem of the legal difficulties regarding  the Rushmere case. There is a strong commitment, from Members on these Benches  and across the Chamber, to support PPS 5, to see it implemented as soon as  possible, and to have it balanced with fair competition in our town centres.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment (Mr S Wilson)</strong>: First, I thank the Members who tabled the  motion on this important issue, about which the public will want to hear the  views of their public representatives.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A flourishing town centre can enhance the quality of life  for those who live, work and visit there. Town centres are a key asset in many  of our communities; they provide a wide range of shops, employment, leisure and  cultural uses. They can, at least sometimes, be reached by public transport,  and they give access to the essentials of living for so many.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Shopping has always been a key use of town centres.  However, it is the diversity of uses, to which some Members made reference  during the debate, that makes town centres successful. When we lose that diversity  &mdash; whatever aspect that may be &mdash; town centres come under threat. Other uses,  apart from shopping, have an important role to play. Indeed, with urban  regeneration we try to attract people back into town centres, to live as well  as to shop.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Of course, as mentioned by a number of Members during the  debate, it is one thing to increase the number of shops in a town centre;  however, if people do not have easy access to those &mdash; because of inadequate  road systems, parking or public transport &mdash; the town centre will not thrive.  People will simply turn their backs on it even though the facilities are there.  There are a lot of ingredients involved, and the debate has been useful in  highlighting that this is not just a single issue. The problem will not be remedied  simply by increasing the number of shops in town centres.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to deal with some of the points that Members raised.  First, I wish to deal with the proposer of the motion, Roy Beggs. I was pleased  by his speech, and I hope that it gets full coverage in the local papers in  East Antrim, because for the past number of months, he has been implying that I  cannot do two jobs: the one that I do at Westminster and the one that I do  here. I am glad that he has extensively reported my involvement in Westminster,  the speeches that I have made there and my involvement in debates.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, I am glad that he recognised that much of the  delay in publishing and implementing PPS 5 has been due to the period of direct  rule. Promises about its publication and the consultation period were made  mostly during that time. That was one of the problems that we faced during  direct rule. Mr Beggs asked that there be no further delay, as did a number of  other Members.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Indeed, the Member for North Antrim Daith&iacute; McKay made the  same point about the legal difficulties and asked how quickly PPS 5 could be  introduced. I will look at the legal situation, even though the judicial review  has been delayed again until November. If it is possible, I will introduce PPS  5 &mdash; I do not want to see it being delayed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Equally, however, I do not want to see PPS 5 issued and  then further delayed because it has been brought forward prematurely. My  intention is to publish PPS 5 as soon as possible.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr W McCrea</strong>:  Will the Minister assure the House that the delay in the meeting of the  Executive caused by Sinn F&eacute;in will not delay the issue of PPS 5?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: If that were the case, I would have made the point a long  time ago and well before I reached this point in the debate. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I assure the Member that I would not have missed that  point: any delay has not been due to the fact that the Executive have not met.  I hope that the Executive will meet so that if I get the go ahead to issue PPS  5, it will not be delayed because of the reason that the Member has suggested.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member for East Antrim Roy Beggs referred to the report  prepared by Tym and Partners. Had he looked at the detail of that report he  would have seen that there is still some potential for growth in retailing,  albeit that Tym states that over the next five years the difference between  demand and supply will probably be met as a result of the planning applications  that are in the pipeline.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I expected the Member for South Antrim Mr Ford to mention  climate change. I am disappointed that he did not &mdash; perhaps he thought that it  was not necessary to do so because it had been raised by the Member for East  Antrim Mr Beggs. There was some predictability that it would be raised.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">To the Member for East Antrim, all I can say is that 97% of  CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are not produced by human activity. The UK produces 3%  of the remaining 3%, and Northern Ireland is responsible for 3% of that 3%. The  Member can do the maths if he wants. Even if we stop driving cars, heating our  homes, producing electricity and other things that produce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, we would save three ten-thousandths of 1% of the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the world. I do not think that PPS 5 is going to make a huge  difference to climate change. I am glad that the Member clarified that he wanted  a balanced approach, because that was not apparent in the speech itself.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I wish that the Member for Newry and Armagh Mr Boylan&rsquo;s  attitude and approach to PPS 14 had been as balanced as his approach to PPS 5.  He made a number of very important points. First, we need regional shopping  centres in Northern Ireland to attract people from outside Northern Ireland &mdash;  from the Irish Republic or elsewhere. Those centres can play an important role  in regenerating a larger area.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly he pointed out, quite rightly, that not all town  centres are suitable for large retail development, either because of historical  significance or building constraints. Those towns should not be denied the  opportunity to have large-scale retail facilities.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Another Member said that there are a number of largish  towns in Northern Ireland that do not have those facilities; that, as a result,  people travel long distances to other towns, and that that may rob town centres  of the people who would come there for other purposes. He also made an  important point about planning reform and the reform of local government in  that there will be ample opportunity for public representatives not to blame  the delay in PPS 5, not to blame the planners at headquarters and not to blame  the planning officer at the divisional office, but to take those hard decisions  themselves.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, that is good, because all the issues that have  been discussed here today can then be judged at a local level, where the local  knowledge that people have demonstrated in this debate can be brought to bear.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Will the Minister give some consideration to the west in relation to  developments of regional significance?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I think that draft PPS 5 is flexible enough to ensure that  that will be the case.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Dallat, as usual, was very good at overstating his case.  He paints the picture that in the future, we will find a situation in Northern  Ireland where we may have to travel for two days to do our shopping. I am not  married; however, if I were, and my wife told me that she had to go away for  two days to do her shopping, I would not look for a draft PPS 5 but a private  detective. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">No matter how devastating the policy that is brought  forward will be, I cannot see the emergence of the picture that Mr Dallat has  described. Mr Dallat mentioned, of course, the delay in PPS 14 and the impact  of that on rural businesses. I wish that PPS 14 had been introduced much  sooner, although I have to say that Mr Dallat&rsquo;s own party &mdash; and one of his  colleagues in particular &mdash; was perhaps partly responsible for the fact that PPS  14 did not get through. However, when PPS 14 comes into effect, the policy on  farm diversification will be in line with rural development policy. I accept Mr  Dallat&rsquo;s point: it is important that rural communities have the opportunity to  have local shops and commercial activities. The policy should reflect that.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member for South Antrim Mr Ford made an important point  in his speech &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  Just the one important point.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Just the one important point. I know, I am handing out too  many accolades today.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Ford pointed out that in some cases, where edge-of-town,  or out-of-town, shopping centres have been allowed, different activities have  then developed in town centres. We cannot run away from the fact that we have a  network of shopping centres, some of which could perhaps be described as  inappropriately located; nevertheless, they are there. It is important that  when we look to regenerate town centres &mdash; and it will be important for local  councils in future &mdash; that sometimes we look for those town centres to offer  different things rather than simply bringing the big shopping centres into the  town. However, that is not always possible. If the shopping centre is at the  edge of town, what can we do to ensure that the people who go there then come  into the nearby town? What activities can we offer to encourage people to come  into our town centres?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Ross, a colleague from East Antrim, made the important  point that we cannot have a policy that is totally restrictive. Some people  have called for a moratorium on any new shopping centres in Northern Ireland;  however, there is still some unmet demand for them. Mr Ross mentioned Larne,  where a recent survey showed that 56% of people leave the town to shop in  Carrickfergus or Ballymena. In doing so, the potential for those shoppers to  drift into the town centre of Larne and do other shopping is totally lost. That  illustrates the point that where there is an anchor store that attracts people  to stay in their town, there is the potential for benefit to that town.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McKay from North Antrim made the very useful point that  if we are going to regenerate town centres and put commercial activity into  them, we must make sure that people can get into them. Whether that is achieved  through town-centre car parking, or through park-and-ride schemes &mdash; which may  not always be possible in some of the smaller towns, because the economies of  scale are not available &mdash; it is an important and necessary part of the whole  regeneration action.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">1.15 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member also asked me &mdash; and I believe that I have  already answered this question &mdash; whether, as soon as the legal issues have been  dealt with, I will proceed with PPS 5. I have made it clear that, if it is  possible even before the legal issues have been dealt with, PPS 5 will be  proceeded with.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the endorsement from the green wing of my own  party for the Banbridge decision. I am sure that I will not receive much more  praise from Mr Wells, but he made an important point: even under existing  planning policies, whether an application was turned down in Ballycastle or in  Banbridge, the policy is not so loose that it cannot be used to turn down bad  applications.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Minister&rsquo;s time is almost up.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I have only two other people to  mention. The Member for North Down Mr Weir spoke about Bangor, where there is  still a thriving town centre, and I hope that &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Minister&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: We  live in a time of change. Industry has changed &mdash; Bombardier, for example, is  embarking on a &pound;500 million spending spree, as it were, in order to update its  equipment and to make itself more competitive.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In agriculture, 100 years ago, people were working with  horses and ploughs. Now, there is sophisticated machinery in the fields. In  health, there is now keyhole surgery, open-heart surgery and transplantation,  none of which would have been dreamt of years ago.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Retailing, too, has changed. I well remember going with my  mother to the wee shop in the countryside where three ladies packed stuff into  boxes, and off we went with our groceries. That was a Friday ritual. Then,  along came Stewarts, Crazy Prices and Wellworth&rsquo;s, and those wee stores  gradually closed. Then, along came Tesco and Sainsbury, and Stewarts and  Wellworth&rsquo;s and Crazy Prices gradually closed. That is the nature of life &mdash;  change takes place, and things move on.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I remember going into Lisburn town centre, as it then was,  to a hardware store on Bow Street, where my father had an altercation with a  traffic warden who was booking him while he was carrying bags of cement out of  Jefferson&rsquo;s to the boot of his car. The traffic warden thought that he should  have parked 200 metres away, but I believe that my father got that situation  sorted out.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">That was the nature of shopping then, but things change and  move on, and some people do not seem to realise that we are moving on. I am  disappointed that Mr Dallat is the only SDLP Member present &mdash; oh, I see Mr  Burns; I apologise. However, Mr Dallat was his party&rsquo;s only contributor to the  debate, and that did not go very well for the SDLP &mdash; it was rather an inept  effort.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Two days&rsquo; travel time for shopping is something that would  happen among the Amish, and perhaps Mr Dallat wants us to become an Amish-style  community. That may be fine for some, but many people will move with the times.  One cannot stop time. &ldquo;Stop the world. I want to get off&rdquo; is not a policy in  which we will engage in Northern Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Northern Ireland must, therefore, move on in respect of  retailing. Change is the reality. There are, in fact, many women from Ulster  who go for two days&rsquo; shopping, but they are going to London, Glasgow,  Edinburgh, Manchester or Liverpool &mdash; and they are going to the big stores  across the water in order to benefit from facilities that are not available in  Northern Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion in the names of Mr Beggs and his colleagues,  which Basil McCrea seemed to be supporting during his comments to Mr Craig,  would have had the effect of stopping, and working against, the likes of IKEA  coming to Northern Ireland. My wife, after a trip to IKEA in Glasgow, told me  that 11 busloads of people had taken the boat over to IKEA that day. That is a  fact of life.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Every year, thousands of people from Northern Ireland  travel to mainland Britain to avail themselves of stores such as Harvey  Nichols, John Lewis, IKEA, and House of Fraser, and they cannot be stopped from  doing so. Consumers will go to shop in those stores whether or not branches  exist here. Not to provide those stores in Northern Ireland serves only to lose  business for Northern Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Does the Member acknowledge that, in the published draft PPS 5, Belfast,  Londonderry and Sprucefield are designated as &ldquo;regional shopping centres&rdquo; of  &ldquo;regional significance&rdquo;? Therefore, large stores, such as those to which he  referred, could qualify for planning permission under that new criterion in the  future.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: Mr  Beggs omitted to raise the issue that I highlighted and has missed the point,  but that is not unusual. Under the terms of the motion and the original PPS 5,  IKEA&rsquo;s planning application would have been turned down. Is IKEA&rsquo;s presence in  Northern Ireland good or bad? Anyone who goes to the IKEA car park will  discover that a considerable number of cars have Southern registration plates.  IKEA brings money and jobs into the Northern Ireland economy, whether Members  wish to acknowledge it.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In Banbridge, The OUTLET&rsquo;s car park also contains many cars  that are registered in the Republic of Ireland. That fact that is backed up by  retailers in the town centre who confirm that, since the opening of The OUTLET,  they handle many more euros than was the case previously. Therefore,  out-of-town shopping centres are not necessarily evil or detrimental to  existing town centres.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">When Marks and Spencer originally opened at Sprucefield,  business increased in Lisburn town centre, as it was then. The Marks and  Spencer store generated an increased footfall, and the town rose to the  challenge and developed in association with it. In fact, Lisburn&rsquo;s main  shopping streets &mdash; Bow Street and Market Square &mdash; suffered not because of  Sprucefield, but as a consequence of the development of Bow Street Mall.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member must bring his remarks to a close.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  People must recognise the facts that I outlined.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I am not sure whether the Member who provided a summary of the amendment is for  or against the main motion, because his argument seems to be that it was better  to allow the development of out-of-town centres. In fact, the main tenor of the  debate has been one of confused rambling from many Members.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I was pleased to hear from Mr Craig, who reached his normal  heights by making an interesting, erudite, thought-provoking and generally  well-presented case. I am sure that the BBC will pick up on the manner of his  contribution. However, I am not sure that he addressed the main issue.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I hear an interesting interjection or two from the Back  Benches. I acknowledge that Mr Paisley Jnr, who has just spoken from a  sedentary position, has an intense interest in planning, as does the previous  Minister of the Environment, Mrs Foster.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, as Mr Dallat said &mdash; and he took some abuse for  trying to explain his point &mdash; people&rsquo;s positions change. He also highlighted  some inconsistencies in past approaches, and it was right and proper for him to  do so.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The DUP has an undoubted interest in planning, and I share  Mr Wells&rsquo;s view that it is, perhaps, one of the most pressing issues that the  Assembly can tackle. I am genuinely looking forward to seeing how the Minister,  Mr Wilson, will deal with it. I am confident that he will bring his normal  flair and elan to the process and take note of the point that Mr Wells raised  about the flood of people who are leaving Kilkeel and where they go. In fact,  he said as much about Larne and various other places.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On the topic of interjections and contributions from  Members, I am interested in Mrs Robinson&rsquo;s inter&shy;vention, during which we could  not get through the issues without hearing about a change of climate in  Fermanagh and a change of climate in Tyrone. The Minister of the Environment  said that climate change may be happening, but that it is not his fault.  However, the real change of climate is the deep freeze that has set in about  the Assembly. The Executive are not meeting, and not a single Front-Bench  Member of Sinn F&eacute;in is here to talk about these issues. Where are they?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText"><span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Member has the Floor.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Some Members do not understand the metaphors that they tried to develop about  climate change and freeze. This place is going into deep freeze because two  parties are incapable of governing. That is why those parties are over at the  Labour Party conference. They are trying to work out a shoddy, back-room deal &mdash;  as they normally do &mdash; instead of being here to deal with real issues. I welcome  the Minister&rsquo;s assertion &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. It is important that the Member returns to the motion.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s assertion that he will push PPS 5 at every available  opportunity. The UUP motion calls for that, and we want that to happen. The  content of PPS 5 and the points that the Minister will take on board as part of  the consultation process should rightfully be debated and brought to the  attention of all Members.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members were unsure about what my colleague Mr Beggs  said. He argued for a proper, sequential assessment of whether it is right to  put a &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member&rsquo;s time is almost up.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  Your time is up.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  In fact, the Member&rsquo;s time is not up. Mr McCrea, you have 10 minutes.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Speaker. No doubt, I will be allowed some injury time as well.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As other Members have said, we want an opportunity for fair  competition. I recognise Mr McKay&rsquo;s point that 50% of income that is generated  in local stores is returned to the economy, whereas in multiples, the figure is  sometimes only 5%. However, one must also recognise that people shop in  multiples because they are cheap and convenient; they provide a service that  people want. They also provide distribution channels throughout the United  Kingdom for many local food producers.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As has been mentioned, parking is one tool that should be  provided to planners and local councillors. One of the biggest issues in  planning is accessibility. A way must be found to get over the tyranny of the  parking warden, which Mr Poots raised with reference to Lisburn. It is  certainly necessary to have people to try to manage the traffic, but a lack of  convenient parking is a disincentive for shopping.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Let me just mention dual mandates. We were encouraged by  the Minister&rsquo;s comments in the House of Commons, which were made when the  Assembly was suspended and more time was available. The Minister suggested that  there was some sort of confusion or conspiracy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We want clarity, forward motion and an end product, because  the lack of a clear and concise planning policy is hindering our economic  development.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">1.30 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I turn to the wording of the motion. Alastair Ross, quite  properly, outlined that the John Lewis store must be built at Sprucefield;  otherwise, it will be built in Dublin. It is obvious that it should be built in  Lisburn. That project should begin now, and we should provide tools and  appropriate legislation to ensure that quick and timely decisions can be made.  Furthermore &mdash; and I know that some other Lagan Valley colleagues have spoken &mdash;  there is a discussion about the expansion of Tesco in our fair city. Mr Ford  said, and he received an accolade from the Minister for the contribution &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>:  Please do not mention that.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I will mention it. The problem is that, once a development is agreed, will it  be utilised for the prupose for which it was originally intended? Other Members  said that development breeds further expansion that changes the character of  the process.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said earlier &mdash; and Mr Speaker, rightly, directed me to  return to the motion &mdash; it is important that the Assembly starts to work  together on issues of mutual importance. It is important that Members identify  issues that unite us and on which we agree. Therefore, we are happy to accept  the amendment proposed by our friends and colleagues in the DUP, despite &mdash; as  Peter Weir said &mdash; some of the arguments that could have persuaded us otherwise.  We hope that the entire House will urge the Minister to introduce a timely,  well-considered PPS 5 in order to enable our country&rsquo;s economy to progress. I  support the motion and the amendment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText"><span class="Italic">Question,</span> That the amendment be  made, <span class="Italic">put and agreed to.</span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Main Question, as amended, put and agreed to.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That this Assembly notes with concern the impact that  out-of-town retail centres can have on the viability of town centres, whilst  recognising the benefit to the Northern Ireland retail sector of some  development of regional significance; and calls on the Minister of the  Environment to publish and implement PPS 5.</p>
		    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="2"></a>Private Members&rsquo; Business</p>
		    <p class="H4StageHeading">Review of Conviction Case</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30 minutes for  the debate. The proposer will have 10 minutes to propose and 10 minutes to make  a winding-up speech. All other Members who wish to speak will have five  minutes.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That this Assembly notes the concerns regarding the  conviction of John Torney who maintained his innocence up to his death in July  2005; recognises that evidence has emerged that was not made available at the  trial and that the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) has yet to  investigate fully all aspects of this new evidence; expresses concern at the  lack of progress by the CCRC in complying with the Order of the Divisional  Court in the High Court made on 22 June 2005; and calls on the CCRC to review  all aspects of the case with a view to its referral to the Court of Appeal.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion refers to the murder convictions of John Torney  at Belfast Crown Court on 4 March 1996. At that court, presided over by the  then Lord Chief Justice, Lord Carswell, John Torney pleaded not guilty.  However, by a majority of 10 to two, the jury convicted John Torney &mdash; a serving  RUC officer &mdash; of the murder of his wife, Linda, his 11-year-old daughter, Emma,  and his 13-year-old son, John Jnr.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The dreadful events of 19 and 20 September 1994 in Lomond  Heights, Cookstown, which resulted in the death of Linda Torney and her two  children, represent an appalling loss of human life and devastating tragedy for  the Torneys and their extended family.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In April 1997, an appeal by John Torney Snr against his  conviction was dismissed by the Court of Appeal. In July 2005, aged 50, John  Torney suddenly died in prison of a heart attack. He protested his innocence to  the very end.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">If one accepts the prosecution case, the cold, calculated  murders were clinically carried out by John Torney Snr using his service  revolver. Worse still, he cynically and audaciously blamed his young son for  carrying out those killings. As the trial judge said in his concluding remarks,  the murders were planned and executed with fiendish ingenuity and ruthless  precision. If that remark were true, he was caught in flagrante delicto. In  that situation, how could one really say that those murders were ingenious? If  he planned to do something such as that, why did he do it in such outrageous  fashion? There is a question mark over that conclusion.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On the other hand, John Torney&rsquo;s defence was that his son  killed his mother, Linda, and his sister, Emma, with John Snr&rsquo;s service  revolver and then committed suicide. On the basis of the evidence presented to  the court, the jury preferred the prosecution case. Both before and after John  Snr&rsquo;s death, the Torney family &mdash; in particular, Hilary Torney &mdash; has pursued a  relentless campaign to have John Snr&rsquo;s murder convictions overturned. They have  done so with great courage, dignity and impressive industry, and they have  lobbied many people. They have come to the Assembly today, Mr Speaker, to seek  your support and to advance his case with the Criminal Cases Review Commission  (CCRC) in order to seek a referral to the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">None of us can determine the truth of what happened on that  tragic night in 1994. However, as Members of the House, we can consider a  number of factors that have come to light since the trial and the unsuccessful  appeal to the Court of Appeal. Those are factors that the Torney campaign and I  believe cast a significant doubt on the way in which the police originally  investigated the killings and on John Torney&rsquo;s ultimate conviction for murder,  based, as it was, on the evidence that was gathered as a result of that  investigation.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On 31 October 2000, BBC &lsquo;Spotlight&rsquo; broadcast a documentary  about the Torney case. That documentary was seen by Dr Samuel McGuinness, the  former headmaster of Cookstown High School, which both Emma and John Jnr  attended at the time of their deaths. The programme reminded Dr McGuinness that  he had had a conversation with a senior investigating officer in the week  commencing 26 September 1994. That senior officer told Dr McGuinness that there  was evidence of sexual activity between John Jnr and his sister, Emma, on the  night of the murders and that semen was found on the girl&rsquo;s body. The same  police officer indicated that no mention of that would be made at the trial, as  they did not want to rub John&rsquo;s nose in it.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">During the programme, Dr McGuinness realised that the  defence at the original trial had not known about that at the time of the  trial. He reported his conversation to the defence solicitor, Mr Keith Burrows.  That was &mdash; and still is &mdash; a very significant development and was referred to  CCRC and the Police Ombudsman&rsquo;s Office for further investigation. Neither of  those investigations was exhaustively concluded, and the Police Ombudsman&rsquo;s  investigation is still notionally extant. A formal decision by the CCRC not to  refer the case to the Court of Appeal was made in 2002.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Ultimately, that led to a judicial review in 2005, in which  Lord Justice Kerr ordered the CCRC to carry out further investigations to  identify the police officers who spoke to Dr McGuinness.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Despite being investigated by the CCRC and the Police  Ombudsman, the three police officers who were recorded as having been in  contact with Dr McGuinness at the time gave statements denying that a  conversation of the sort described by Dr McGuinness ever took place. Indeed,  one police officer, whom I will not name, claimed that he had not spoken to Dr  McGuinness about any sexual history between John Torney Jnr and his sister,  Emma. However, he went on to state:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;In fact I do not recall being aware of any  information regarding possible sexual history between the two during my time on  the investigation team.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is an extraordinary statement, which demands  careful explanation, because the same officer took a statement from Miss Laura  Mattingley on 24 September 1994 in which she recalled how Emma Torney told her,  inter alia, that her brother, John, had sexually abused her during the summer  holidays.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Despite Dr McGuinness&rsquo;s assertion that he would be able to  identify the investigating officer by sight or photograph, no opportunity has  been afforded to him to do so, and, therefore, the matter is stuck at that  point. The significance of Dr McGuinness&rsquo;s allegation, if true, is that at an  early stage of the police&rsquo;s investigation, they ignored or suppressed evidence  of actual sexual contact between brother and sister. Either allegation, if  proven, would have had a major bearing on the case if it had been raised at the  original trial or subsequently at the appeal. Therefore, it is essential that that  matter be exhaustively investigated by CCRC or the Police Ombudsman. It is  crucial that Dr McGuinness is afforded an opportunity to identify the police  officer. Such an opportunity has been withheld for technical legal reasons,  which, in such a grave case, must be removed in order to determine the truth.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is clear that at an early stage of the police  investigation, two schoolgirls recorded in written statements Emma&rsquo;s  allegations of sexual abuse by her brother. That opened up an alternative line  of inquiry, which the police, for whatever reason, did not pursue. Presumably,  believing that it was an open-and-shut case, they deemed that no further lines  of inquiry were necessary.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Dr McGuinness&rsquo;s serious allegation is, in effect, the key  to having an in-depth review of the case. The CCRC takes the view that there is  insufficient evidence to refer the case back to the Court of Appeal and,  although the Police Ombudsman&rsquo;s investigation is not yet concluded, no formal  communication has been received from that office since 2006.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Members should note that at no stage did Mr Torney make any  allegations of sexual abuse by his son. That allegation arose from the  statements made by the two pupils at his daughter&rsquo;s school.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My time is short; there are other matters that should be  covered, which I cannot cover. There are aspects of the forensic evidence in  the case that are unsatisfactory &mdash; for example, Emma Torney&rsquo;s pyjama suit was  lost, and, therefore, it was not possible for it to be forensically examined.  That might have revealed evidence of abuse. Furthermore, the absence of  gunpowder residue on John Jnr&rsquo;s hands raises serious questions. Those matters  must be thoroughly reviewed in order to bring some sense of finality and  justice to the case.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Any reasonable observer would agree that there is grave  doubt about this case, and it should be further investigated by CCRC until firm  conclusions are reached and the matter can be referred back to the Court of  Appeal.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  support the motion. However, leaving aside matters of justice and the rights  and wrongs of what was done in court, we should, above all, keep in mind the  fact that we are faced with a human tragedy.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">1.45 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It was a tragedy that led directly to the deaths of three  people &mdash; John Torney Jnr, Emma Torney and Mrs Linda Torney. John Torney Snr is  also deceased. Above all else, our thoughts should be with the families  concerned &mdash; not just the Torney family, but the Duff family as well. The Duffs  are Mrs Torney&rsquo;s relatives.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly must, and I believe that it does, adopt a  solemn approach to such issues and treat them with gravitas, sensitivity and  caution. I say caution because I appreciate that the Torney family has been  told by its legal team that this motion may be the best way to apply pressure  on the issue.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, I am reluctant in principle for the Assembly to  deal with individual court cases. It is wrong to have a trial by Assembly. As  has been indicated, this House is not a court of law. Indeed, because neither Mr  Torney Snr nor Mr Torney Jnr are here to answer the allegations against them,  it is difficult for Members to make judgements or to stray into the area of  allegations.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate that, in proposing the motion, Mr Maginness  had to outline the circumstances of the case. However, it is difficult when  people are not able to defend themselves or comment. As the Assembly is not a  court of law, I do not intend to go into the details of the case. I cannot say  whether Mr Torney Snr is guilty or innocent. I cannot say whether the  conviction is safe or unsafe. Even if I were to have a clear view in my own  mind, it would not be appropriate for the Assembly to pass such a judgement.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">After reading the case files, I am convinced that, as Alban  Maginness said, there are a range of issues that must be considered. They  include the evidence of Dr McGuinness, the procedures that were applied, some  of the evidence that has come to light since the case was last considered by  CCRC and concerns about the forensic evidence. I do not know whether those  issues are enough to say that the conviction was unsafe. That is not my  judgement to make. However, they raise serious questions, and there must be a  proper examination of the Torney case.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  The Member is right to say that the Assembly is not a court of law, nor does it  intend to act as a court of law. The facts that I adverted to provided a  necessary foundation for the debate.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member should know, however, that whether or not one is  convinced of Mr Torney&rsquo;s innocence, the fact remains that doubt is caused by  the allegation raised by Dr McGuinness. That doubt and those allegations must  be investigated thoroughly and brought to a conclusion. One cannot predict what  those conclusions will be, but, nonetheless, the doctor&rsquo;s allegation raises  such serious doubt that the CCRC must be urged to reinvestigate thoroughly, as  suggested by the High Court.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">That is the substance of the motion, and I welcome the  Member&rsquo;s support in that respect.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Mr Weir will be allowed an extra minute for that intervention.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Speaker.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, I am reluctant to go down the road of opening up  court cases in the Assembly, however justified that action might be. I am  concerned about the precedent such that that would set. There are clear issues  in the Torney case. I am not in a position to judge whether that will lead to a  declaration that the conviction was unsafe. That would also be wrong for me to  judge. However, it is clear to me that there are serious issues that must be  examined. Consequently, in order to ensure that the maximum amount of scrutiny  is brought to bear on the case, it is right and appropriate that the evidence  in the case be re-examined by the CCRC.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Members on this side of the House support the motion.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. In a way, I broadly endorse Mr Weir&rsquo;s  comments. On behalf of my party, I support the broad thrust of the motion. Like  Mr Weir, I do not want to delve into the poignant and difficult issues that  have been raised in the Chamber this afternoon.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">This morning, I had a first-hand briefing from members of  Mr Torney&rsquo;s family, and I appreciate the time that they took to do that. In the  early hours of 20 September 1994, three members of the Torney family lost their  lives in tragic circumstances, and that was followed by Mr Torney Snr losing  his life in 2005. We are discussing an immense and horrific family tragedy, and  I extend our sympathy for and solidarity with all the family members concerned.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am not in a position to second-guess the original  judgement or what may be produced in a further trial or review, but some of the  issues that have been raised seem to resonate with previous experiences,  unfortunately. I do not intend to single out what may or may not be deficiencies  in the original case. However, issues have been raised in relation to  forensics, the identification of officers, and additional evidence that may  have come to light recently.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, Sinn F&eacute;in supports the motion on the broad basis  that a wide range of issues has been raised by the Torney family and others,  such as the legal advisers and other experts. Indeed, the courts have asked for  several of those matters to be examined. On that basis, we call on the CCRC to  consider the case afresh and examine any new evidence. Ultimately, people have  been bereaved and have suffered, so if there is evidence of an injustice or of  a failure of the justice system, we want to see that redressed. On that basis,  Sinn F&eacute;in supports the motion.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I am grateful for the opportunity to lend my support and that of my party to  the broad thrust of the motion. The circumstances surrounding the death of the  Torney family in 1994 were harrowing, and it must be very difficult for the  wider family circle to come to terms with that. Equally, the death of John  Torney in 2005 must still be difficult for those who are trying to clear his  name.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with the comments made by Mr Weir, a Member for  North Down, that this is a legislative Assembly and not a court of law.  Therefore, all Members must take due care and consideration with what we say  and how we say it.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I, as well as other Members, have met representatives of  the Torney family on several occasions. They have presented the evidence  surrounding the case and conviction of John Torney Snr to me. Having considered  the material presented, I am confident that significant evidence is now  obtainable that was either not considered or not made available at the time of  the trial. I am also convinced that avenues of investigation exist that must  and should be followed by the Criminal Cases Review Commission.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The testimony of Dr Samuel McGuinness, former head of  Cookstown High School, is crucial to the case. In October 2000, Dr McGuinness  provided a sworn affidavit in which he stated that he had been informed by a  policeman of significant evidence that could have altered the outcome of the  murder trial. However, that evidence was not used. Dr McGuinness has not  subsequently been given the opportunity to correctly identify that police  officer. However, in June 2005, just weeks before Mr Torney&rsquo;s death, the Lord  Chief Justice ordered the Criminal Cases Review Commission to take such steps  as it may to utilise the evidence that was presented by Dr McGuinness. To my  knowledge, that has not happened.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am also disappointed that the former Police Ombudsman for  Northern Ireland, when asked to investigate the allegations made by Dr  McGuinness, apparently concluded that she found no evidence to substantiate  those allegations. From the evidence presented to me and others, that seems a  peculiar decision.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In any potential miscarriage of justice, there will always  be grey areas and intangible aspects that cannot be measured. However, Mr  Torney and his family have always protested his innocence. The prosecution&rsquo;s  case must be further scrutinised and any evidence that was missed or lines of  investigation that have not been pursued must be examined.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The basis of every democratic society is the rule of law  and a fair trial. The great thing about democracy is the influence and input of  ordinary people, but that also can be a weakness. Human frailty can lead to  mistakes &mdash; intentional or unintentional &mdash; and those can lead to miscarriages of  justice. A measure of any democratic society is its ability to limit the  occurrence of miscarriages of justice and the steps that it takes to  investigate those, if and when they occur. It is not inconceivable that any one  of us, or our families, could be accused of a crime. In that event, we would  hope that the correct processes would be applied and the fullest investigations  made to ensure the right and truthful outcome.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The circumstances and potential new evidence surrounding  the case warrant further and fuller investigation by the Criminal Cases Review  Commission. It must comply fully with the order of the divisional court of the  High Court in 2005 &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member must draw his remarks to a close.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  To fail to do the aforementioned would be an affront to the Torney family, and  a slight to the legal and democratic principles of Northern Ireland. I support  the motion.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  The Alliance Party also supports the motion. First and foremost, the events  under discussion must be viewed as a tragedy for the Torney family and the  wider family circles of those involved. I include Mr Torney Snr, who died in  prison while still protesting his innocence. As we have heard, a number of  issues &mdash; seemingly unresolved &mdash; may have impacted on his incarceration.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, the Assembly is not a court of law and, specifically,  it is not a court of appeal. None of us in this Chamber can say with any degree  of authority what did or did not happen on that night in 1994. Our concern must  be whether justice has been done. To know that, we must be sure that the  various agencies involved have considered all the material facts and evidence,  and that the checks and balances that exist in our criminal justice system have  operated properly.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Several issues of dispute and uncertainty are still  outstanding and relate to the motive of those convicted and potential  scenarios; forensics, relating specifically to the night in question and the  issues raised by Mr Maginness regarding evidence that had not been properly  examined or seen to be examined; and the nature of the family relationships,  including the allegation of sexual relationships in the family, which has not  been explored fully in court.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Where can we go from here? There are two issues to be  considered. The first, and probably the more minor issue, relates to the  performance of the Police Ombuds&shy;man&rsquo;s office. The family reported,  disappointingly, a lack of response from that office to allegations that they  made as to how the case was investigated. Indeed, they have not had an  acknowledgement of those allegations.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The second, and broader issue, relates to the Criminal  Cases Review Commission, which is a UK-wide body and not directly accountable  to the Assembly. Nonetheless, there are issues as to whether it sufficiently  and rigorously implemented the decision of the Court of Appeal in 2005. That  alleged failure may be an issue that the family might wish to challenge further  through a further judicial review. The broader issue is whether the case should  be referred back to the Court of Appeal on the basis of new evidence and facts  that have come to light or have been reviewed and reanalysed?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I recognise that the Assembly should tread with a certain  degree of trepidation when looking at individual cases. However, while bearing  in mind that the CCRC is not accountable to the Assembly, we, as elected  representatives of the people of Northern Ireland, have a duty to speak out  when we believe that there have been systemic failures or the potential for  systemic failures. Public interest warrants a fuller examination of the  situation, and there is the potential for further consideration under our legal  system.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I welcome the debate for the reasons outlined by Stephen Farry, who said that  there is a duty to speak out when there has been potential systemic failure and  injustice. That should be the touchstone against which the Assembly should be  judged and should judge itself. We have a duty to speak out when there is  potential systemic failure and injustice. If, during its life, the Assembly  uses that touchstone to guide it in respect of such cases, then it will affirm  itself as being responsive to the community in the North that it serves.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion is one of a school of motions to have come  before the Assembly in the past few months and, no doubt, will come before the  Assembly again. In April this year the Assembly endorsed unanimously a motion  in respect of the case of Raymond McCord Jnr. Without trying to usurp the  authority of the courts or second-guess any other criminal justice institution  in the North, the Assembly, nonetheless, made a decision on what could be a  case of injustice.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A few months before that, a DUP motion on the case of a  miscarriage of justice in the Republic of Ireland was similarly endorsed  unanimously on the Floor of the Assembly.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that, in the coming weeks and months, the Assembly  will have an opportunity to debate similar cases of alleged miscarriages of  justice, or alleged cases of injustice, not least the case of the people killed  by the British Army in Ballymurphy in 1971.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I acknowledge Peter Weir&rsquo;s comment that the Assembly must  not usurp the authority of other justice institutions in the North. However,  when families have little option, it is appropriate for the Assembly to make  statements about alleged miscarriages of justice or cases of injustice. We have  done that in the past, and I trust that we will do so in future. Although we  must act judicially, we should not shirk that responsibility.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">That is the best way in which to view this debate. The  debate should reassure everyone in the Chamber and outside that we are acting  appropriately and with discretion in such cases. Sadly and necessarily, as Alex  Maskey indicated in his intervention, a new profile and new energy is often  required in cases of miscarriages of justice or cases of injustice in order for  the wrong to be remedied. John Torney&rsquo;s family are strongly convinced of his  innocence, and they hope that the Assembly will help to give a new profile and  new energy to the efforts that they have made over many years to rectify what  they and many other people see as a great wrong.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Four essential issues arise in the case of John Torney, and  other authorities must deal with those issues quickly. Alban Maginness referred  to the first issue &mdash; the allegation that there was an abusive relationship between  the son and daughter who so tragically died with their mother. If the police  knew of that allegation in the hours immediately after the tragic murders, was  that evidence ignored or suppressed, as the family and Alban have said? If  proven, the suppression of that evidence would give rise, prima facie, to  whether there should have ever been a prosecution, trial or conviction, never  mind a life sentence. That matter goes to the heart of the case but is still  not being fully faced up to by the authorities with the relevant  responsibilities.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The second issue concerns the conduct of the police  officers who had responsibility for investigating the case. According to a  sworn testimony, one of the three police officers told a witness &mdash; a former  headmaster of Emma and John Jnr &mdash; that, although there was evidence of a sexual  and abusive relationship, it would not be pursued by the police. In statements  to the Police Ombudsman, all three police officers denied that one of them gave  the witness that information, despite his sworn evidence to the contrary. That  is at the heart of the level of confidence that we can have in the police&rsquo;s  investigation of criminal matters.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The third issue concerns the continuing role of the  Criminal Cases Review Commission, which is responsible for dealing with  miscarriages of justice in Britain and Northern Ireland. As Stephen Farry  indicated, the High Court directed the CCRC to take all necessary steps to  identify the officer who gave the information to the headmaster. That was three  years ago. If any of our constituents told us that a court of law in Northern  Ireland had directed another responsible body to conduct all necessary steps to  identify those officers more than three years ago and that that had not yet  happened, what would we say about the inordinate delay and the alleged  technicalities, which Alban Maginness mentioned, that caused the delay?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">That matter goes to the heart of the process and affects  confidence in how the CCRC conducts its affairs, and it must be addressed  immediately.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The fourth point was highlighted by the Member for Newry  and Armagh Mr Kennedy; namely, that a Police Ombudsman investigation returned a  negative outcome in respect of the family&rsquo;s complaint. A further complaint was  raised with the Police Ombudsman over two years ago, but, at this stage, no  conclusion has been reached, and no information was brought to the family&rsquo;s  attention during that period.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is more than legitimate for the Assembly to shine a  spotlight on cases of that nature when responsible bodies such as the CCRC on  the one hand, and the Police Ombudsman on the other, have not, after such  inordinate delay, reached conclusions or completed the task set for them by the  High Court in the North. It is legitimate for the Assembly to say that justice  delayed is justice denied. A case that takes so many years to come to the point  of review and satisfaction is surely one about which the Assembly should speak  out loudly.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, I welcome the support of Members,  particularly the comments from members of the Ulster Unionist Party and the  Alliance Party. Although I am aware of the words of caution that have been  expressed in other places, I will repeat what I said at the outset of the  debate: if this House cannot speak up for those families who no longer have the  opportunity to speak for themselves, we will have failed in our responsibility  and obligation to them. As our history of the past 40 years has shown, there  are many families like the Torneys. Many people have suffered wrongs that need  to be rectified and much hurt endures. We should judge ourselves on how we have  helped those people when we consider what we have contributed to the betterment  of our society.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly notes the concerns regarding the  conviction of John Torney who maintained his innocence up to his death in July  2005; recognises that evidence has emerged that was not made available at the  trial and that the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) has yet to  investigate fully all aspects of this new evidence; expresses concern at the  lack of progress by the CCRC in complying with the Order of the Divisional  Court in the High Court made on 22 June 2005; and calls on the CCRC to review  all aspects of the case with a view to its referral to the Court of Appeal.</p>
		    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="3"></a>Private Members&rsquo; Business</p>
		    <p class="H4StageHeading">Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30 minutes for  this debate. The proposer will have 10 minutes in which to propose the motion  and 10 minutes to make a winding-up speech. All other Members who wish to speak  will have five minutes.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly calls on the Minister of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety to introduce policies to reduce the level of Foetal  Alcohol Spectrum Disorder; where necessary co-operating with other agencies and  Departments; and to introduce dedicated teams to assist families affected by  Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I did not bring this subject to the House to be negative or  judgemental or to scaremonger. I state categorically that I understand that no  one deliberately intends to harm an unborn child. This debate is not an attack  on the Minister or the professionals who deal with foetal alcohol spectrum  disorder (FASD) daily. I sincerely believe that they deserve our utmost respect  and admiration. I tabled the motion to raise awareness of the effects of the  disorder. I want to highlight the devastating effect that alcohol or drug  misuse can have on an unborn child and the need of families, who live daily  with FASD, for diagnosis and a support network.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">This debate is about the well-being of future generations.  Some people may not fully appreciate the damage that alcohol can cause to the  unborn child. Problems affecting a child with FASD include: varying degrees of  facial disfigurement; brain damage, resulting in poor social skills; inability  to learn simple tasks; behavioural problems; and an impact on co-ordination and  motor skills. Those problems affect the entire family of a child with FASD.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As the term &ldquo;spectrum disorder&rdquo; implies, there is a wide  variation in the severity of the condition and in the level of support  required. FASD is not a well-publicised condition, but that does not mean that  we, as a society, can afford to overlook the daily needs of the families and  children who are affected by it. Their needs must be identified and addressed.  Everyone in the Chamber must play a part in getting the ball rolling today.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The effects of alcohol on the unborn child are permanent &mdash;  they do not go away. However, they are entirely avoidable. An interdepartmental  co-operative approach must be adopted to achieve the objective of reducing the  number of children affected by FASD. It must involve the Department of  Education, the Depart&shy;ment for Employment and Learning, the Department for  Social Development, the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  and national organisations who can supply the knowledge on which new policy and  structures can be firmly based. Such a multi-agency approach will ensure that  all resources are utilised efficiently and effectively &mdash; in short, joined-up  working.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The problem of drinking before and during pregnancy must be  raised early with young people. I say young people, rather than young women,  because research has shown that alcohol consumption during adolescence can also  have a detrimental effect on the fertility of young men. It may permanently  alter the DNA that they pass on to their children, increasing the risk of birth  defects such as FASD.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We must examine the dual issues of whom we should target  and how, operationally, that can be achieved. It can be done through the  education system, youth groups, family planning clinics or anywhere that young  people get together. The means of delivery must be relevant and must utilise  multiple threads of communication, such as leaflets, social networking websites  and the traditional media. The policy in Northern Ireland should be to prevent,  rather than deal with, birth defects caused by alcohol. There is an old adage,  &ldquo;prevention is better than cure&rdquo;.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">General public awareness must be raised. Even in today&rsquo;s  society, parents have an important role to play. In the interests of public  health, a publicity campaign should be undertaken to help to raise awareness of  FASD among our citizens.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In the education sphere, some of the possible problems of  FASD include: a reduced attention span; frustration; poor problem solving; the  feeling of difference and exclusion from their peers; and delays or defects in  speech and language development. However, every child with FASD is an  individual and will have different needs.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Many children with FASD have exceptional abilities in one  area, be it music, art or mathematics. Therefore, the people of Northern  Ireland should be responsible for ensuring that such children achieve their  maximum potential. We need better diagnosis and specialised services. At the  moment, there is no accurate information on the number of children with FASD.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Some parents have told me that they have had difficulty  getting an accurate diagnosis of the disorder. In fact, last week one parent  told me that their child&rsquo;s diagnosis of FASD had been overturned. The  implications of that are huge, as the support services that have been in place,  and even benefit entitlement, may also be removed from that family.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">From my perspective, that is a shocking state of affairs.  How can that family be expected to cope physically, emotionally or financially?  I secured this debate in order to urge the Minister to put in place a  comprehensive service designed for those children and families who, sadly, have  to live with FASD. As with any medical condition, there must be, primarily, an  accurate diagnosis so that families are not left in turmoil because of medical  inconsistencies.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I can almost hear the Minister screaming in my ear,  &ldquo;George, what about the cost?&rdquo; I ask the Minister: what is the cost of doing  nothing? There is a continuing need for lifelong medical assistance, special  arrangements for education and medication to treat the secondary symptoms of  FASD, all of which cost, at best, millions over each generation. Many of the  specialised services and personnel required to supply those services are  already available in the different systems. It is not a long journey to make in  order to utilise them. However, every journey begins with one step, and I ask  the Minister to take that step by liaising with other Departments and support  organisations in order to ensure that those communications are embedded and  developed. After an accurate diagnosis, families must have barrier-free, easy  access to the services that are beneficial to them.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am fully aware that there is no quick fix for this  problem, but we have to start somewhere at some time. That time and place is  now. Children with FASD carry the effects for their lifetime. That is why  parents need accurate diagnostic and support programmes that are obviously and  desperately required in order to achieve the objectives that I have brought to  the attention of the House today.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The FASAwareUK website states that FASD:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;is the biggest cause of non-genetic mental handicap  in the western world and the only one that is 100% preventable.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Let the Assembly encourage the Minister to take the first  step on the journey.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I support the motion and welcome the  opportunity to speak on it. The motion calls on the Minister of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;to introduce policies to reduce the level of Foetal  Alcohol Spectrum Disorder &hellip; and to introduce dedicated teams to assist families  affected by Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Drinking during pregnancy may give rise to foetal  alcohol spectrum disorder, and babies who have been subjected to alcohol while  in the womb are also more at risk of sudden infant death. That is a cause of  great concern, especially as we appear to have a culture of binge drinking.  According to a representative of the Royal College of Midwives, many women  carry a binge-drinking habit into their pregnancies.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In general, more people are aware of the dangers that are  associated with smoking during pregnancy, but there is much less awareness of  the effects of alcohol while pregnant. In the past few years there has been  increased awareness-raising of the effects of alcohol consumption by pregnant  women and those trying to conceive. However, more must be done, especially as  some health professionals suggest that foetal alcohol spectrum disorder is  increasing and that, due to the complexity of the disorder, many cases are not  being diagnosed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Foetal alcohol spectrum disorder is the umbrella term used  to describe a range of effects that can be caused by maternal alcohol exposure.  Children that are identified as having FASD show signs of behavioural,  intellectual and physical difficulties, including learning difficulties, poor  language and memory skills, and attention problems. Who would willingly subject  their child to such problems? Who would willingly drink alcohol, knowing that  those difficulties could be the outcome? We must provide targeted support and  advice, so that women are made aware of the effects of the condition and can  make an informed choice.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We have sought changes to the advice that is offered to  women about drinking alcohol during pregnancy. The National Institute for  Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines were revised in recent years to reflect  the change in thinking. NICE now recommends that alcohol should be avoided  altogether during pregnancy, but it says that those who wish to consume alcohol  should minimise the risk to the baby by refraining from drinking alcohol in the  first three months of pregnancy and thereafter consuming only a few units a  week. Even that advice is confusing and is causing a great deal of concern.  Women are asking whether they should or should not have a drink during  pregnancy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">FASD is completely preventable through the elimination of  drinking during pregnancy. Therefore, we have a duty to ensure that every  possible effort is made to raise awareness and to bring down the level of FASD,  or, if possible, to eliminate it. The dangers of drinking too much alcohol have  been well documented for years. However, in recent times, healthcare  professionals have made more concerted efforts to increase public awareness. I  want to commend those professionals involved in the campaign, and pledge my  support to help them along the way.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In order to lead an informed campaign, there is a need for  more information, a good understanding of the continuum of permanent birth  defects associated with FASD, and an increased awareness of the risks of  pre-natal alcohol exposure among the general public, in particular among women  who are pregnant, or considering pregnancy. That has been made more difficult  by the fact, for which there is evidence, that FASD consists of a set of  conditions that are poorly understood, not only by the general public, but by  health professionals. Therefore, there is a need for more studies of the  effects of those conditions, so that the best support can be provided.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It appears that the best advice for pregnant women seeking  clarity on whether they can drink alcohol or not is to refrain altogether,  because there is no definitive research to suggest that there is a safe level  of alcohol consumption during pregnancy. If a pregnant woman consumes alcohol,  it will go into her bloodstream, and, from there, straight into the baby&rsquo;s  bloodstream. In some cases, that alcohol can have a toxic effect on the foetus.  Surely, that is enough to deter any mum-to-be. If you are drinking, your baby  is drinking. I support the motion.

		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. Question Time is about to begin, and yet  again, four of the first six questions to be asked are from the party of the  Minister who will receive those questions. We have been assured that the  selection of questions is a random process. Clearly, it cannot be, and I would  like an explanation of that.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  All I can say to the Member is that the questions are selected by random  ballot. Neither I, nor my office, take any part in that procedure.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Further to that point of order, Mr Speaker. I thank you for the clarification,  and I realise that that is the case. I am not a statistician, but, although the  process appears to be the chance selection of a ballot, four, five or six of  the first six questions are regularly asked by the party to which the  responding Minister belongs. There is something not right. I am not saying that  something is wrong, but something is not right.</p>

		    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mr A  Maskey </strong>asked the Minister of Education to confirm if she is aware of any  proposals on post-primary transfer from the Democratic Unionist Party.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO230/09>(AQO 230/09)</a></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education (Ms Ruane)</strong>: Is m&oacute;r an d&iacute;om&aacute; dom &eacute; nach raibh an Coiste Oideachais  n&aacute; p&aacute;irtithe polait&iacute;ochta eile &aacute;balta aghaidh a thabhairt ar na buncheisteanna  a bhaineann le haistri&uacute; iarbhunoideachais go f&oacute;ill. Go dt&iacute; seo, n&iacute;or th&aacute;inig  aon chomhdhearcadh chun solais agus n&iacute;or cuireadh aon mholta&iacute; eile ar an chl&aacute;r  ach amh&aacute;in mo mholta&iacute;-se.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am disappointed that the Education Committee and other  political parties have not addressed the real issues on post-primary transfer.  No consensus has emerged, and mine remain the only significant proposals on the  table. When I brought my proposals to the Executive on 15 May 2008, and during  discussions with the Education Committee the following day, I made it clear  that I was happy to listen to constructive comments about the proposals and  that I would engage constructively with anyone who has ideas that improve them.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for her  reply. Have there been any proposals from the Education Committee that could,  even now, offer the prospect of a consensus?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Go raibh maith agat as an cheist sin agus as an phointe sin. Two  comments struck me from the comments that I received from the Committee. First,  some Committee members feel that some breathing space is required. To an  extent, I agree, which is why my proposals include the partial continuation of  academic selection during its phased abolition between 2010 and 2013, which was  a difficult feature for me. However, there will be no distortion of the  primary-schools curriculum as a result.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, the Committee showed interest in an important  feature of the proposals that has received relatively little attention &mdash; the  development of academic streams, which could be academic schools within  clusters of schools. Academic provision will continue to exist, and I have  always made it clear that it should continue to be a key part of our system at  all ages, but particularly from 14. I propose that curricular provision be  all-embracing in all areas and offer the full entitlement framework to all  children. However, I envisage that school diversity and specialism will continue  and flourish.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My position has always been that academic selection is  unnecessary. By that I partly mean that there are ways to have schools with a  strong academic emphasis in their provision that are fairer, better and more  flexible than academically selective admissions procedures conducted at ages  10, 11 or 14. Academic selection is unnecessary at 11 and at 14.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Throughout the process, I have listened carefully to all  the main interests &mdash; educational and other &mdash; and worked to achieve a consensual  way forward. My proposals offer a compromise solution for those who, like me,  do not regard the current system as the way forward and do not hang on to the  past. There are areas of commonality, but the Committee has failed to make any  consensus proposals.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Mr Deputy Speaker, will you rule on whether the Minister&rsquo;s previous answer has  any relevance to the question that she was asked? Despite being asked a  question about proposals from the DUP, all the Minister did was attack the  Education Committee. Obviously, that was the statement &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. Will the Member ask his question?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  In her answer, the Minister tried to do what the rest of her party has been  doing over the past few days &mdash; abdicate the responsibility that comes from  being part of the Executive. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Will the Minister accept that her proposals have not received consensus, and  will she agree to meet me after today&rsquo;s sitting to consider further proposals  from the DUP? The DUP put proposals on the table &mdash; we went to the public with  them. Mr O&rsquo;Dowd is going round the country doing the same because the Minister  has little support.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister agree to meet me and discuss my  alternative proposals in order to see whether consensus can be reached? Then,  perhaps, that will remove the confusion that exists among parents of children  who are in P6. The blockage remains with the Minister.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: There is no confusion among parents of P6 children. Some people  have tried to create the myth that there is confusion. A Chathaoirligh,  primary-school teachers and principals are well aware of what they will be  teaching, which is the revised curriculum. Teachers like the revised  curriculum. The teaching unions are opposed to distortion of the curriculum.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have always said that I am available to meet the  Chairperson of the Education Committee. I have yet to receive the Committee&rsquo;s  consensus proposals. I look forward to receiving them. In fact, I will attend  the Education Committee, where a good discussion on the matter can take place.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Let us not play politics with children&rsquo;s education, which  is what Mervyn Storey is doing. I am glad that people have reached consensus  that change is needed and that they understand that the current system fails  many children from different communities. Progress must be made. I have made  proposals after engaging extensively with all of the different stakeholders  during several months of consultation. The Member&rsquo;s party did not even discuss those  proposals in the Executive. I look forward to the Executive&rsquo;s discussion,  because I will bring &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: If I may finish my answer &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Please take your seat for a moment, Minister. Mr Storey, you are  aware that no points of order are taken during Question Time. All remarks must  be made through the Chair. Last week, I told Members that all remarks must be  made through the Chair &mdash; not over it, nor under it.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I look forward to the Executive meeting at which my proposals  are discussed. Progress must be made on the basis of equality, partnership and  respect. That is the greatest message that the Assembly can send to children in  every class from P1 to P7. Children need to see politicians engage with each  other on the basis of equality and partnership. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  Despite what the Minister has just said, will she accept that both the public  and schools are mystified as to what her proposals entail? Will she undertake  to bring a motion to the House that will enable each party to set forth its  ideas in public?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: N&iacute; ghlacaim leis sin. I do not accept that. The reason is that I  go into schools and meet educationalists every day of the week. They understand  the need for the system to be changed. They are crying out for change and are  thankful that the Department is bringing it about. They are also well aware of  who resists and blocks change. The message that comes from schools in every  community is that blocking change disadvantages working-class children on the  Falls, on the Shankill and in Ballymena, Coleraine, Derry and all parts of the  North of Ireland. Let us continue to make change, rather than try to interrupt  and block ministerial proposals. Let us move forward and bring about change for  the children who need it. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>

	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Revised Curriculum</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr  McLaughlin </strong>asked the Minister of Education to confirm that she will take  action against any school attempting to divert feeder primary schools from  teaching the revised curriculum.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO226/09> (AQO  226/09)</a></p>

	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Transfer Procedures: Advice</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">8. <strong>Mr  Neeson </strong>asked the Minister of Education what advice her Department has given  to primary schools in relation to the transfer procedure for pupils currently  in P6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO194/09> (AQO 194/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Le do thoil  freagr&oacute;idh m&eacute; ceisteanna, 2, 5, agus 8 le ch&eacute;ile.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">With your permission, Mr Deputy Speaker, I shall answer  questions 2, 5 and 8 together.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">T&aacute; ceangal dl&iacute; ar scoileanna an curaclam reacht&uacute;il a  shol&aacute;thar do dhalta&iacute; den aois &eacute;igeantach scoile.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Schools are required by law to deliver the statutory  curriculum for pupils of compulsory school age. The revised curriculum was not  designed with testing for the purposes of selection in mind.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Over the years, the transfer tests have had a damaging  effect on the delivery of the primary school curriculum. I am mindful of that  in the proposals for which I seek a legislative framework. In the interests of  consensus, they include a transitional test for a three-year period, which is  available to schools that feel that they need time to adjust to the reform.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Chuir m&eacute; in i&uacute;l go soil&eacute;ir gur mhian liom go mbeidh  bunscoileanna ag d&iacute;ri&uacute; a n-iarrachta&iacute; go heisiach ar mh&uacute;ineadh an churaclaim  athbhreithnithe nuair a thagann deireadh leis na teisteanna aistrithe at&aacute; ann  faoi l&aacute;thair.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When the current transfer tests end, I want to see primary  schools focus entirely on teaching the revised curriculum. I expect every  teacher and principal in our primary schools to fulfil the statutory duty of  delivering the revised curriculum to our children and not to be diverted from  that important task by the particular admissions requirements of any  post-primary school. I can rely on the teaching profession in the primary  sector to do the best for children in their schools.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, let me be clear, if any school is found to flout  the law, I will take action.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her forthright reply. Will she tell us what the Education  and Training Inspectorate will do if it encounters evidence that schools set  aside the requirements of the curriculum to focus on test preparation?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: The Education and Training Inspectorate is an independent means  of reporting occasions in which the statutory curriculum is distorted by  testing for the purposes of selection. If it encounters evidence that the  revised curriculum has been set aside for any reason, it will report that as  part of the inspection procedures. Any such report will be published on the  departmental website. Therefore, parents and the Department will be made aware  of such evidence, and appropriate action will be taken to protect the education  of the young people in that school.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Boards of governors have a statutory duty to secure the  delivery of the statutory curriculum in their schools. If parents feel that  their child&rsquo;s school is not delivering the broad and balanced requirements of  the curriculum, they have a right of appeal to an independent curriculum complaints  tribunal. Following such proceedings, the Department has the power to direct a  school to fulfil its duties. Furthermore, teachers&rsquo; unions can report to the  Department if they feel that teachers or schools are not fulfilling the  statutory duties that are outlined in the curriculum.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  Will the Minister assure the House that the transitional test will not distort  the revised curriculum?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Is f&eacute;idir liom sin a dh&eacute;anamh. Before I do so, I congratulate  the Member on her county winning the all-Ireland final yesterday. I was  privileged to be at the match. My own county, Mayo, unfortunately drew with her  county, but that result might be rectified next week. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am answering the question on the revised curriculum. I am  sure that children in many schools in Tyrone are preparing artwork for the  return of the Tyrone team. I am sure that the Member will attend the return of  the team. Sport is also education.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The transitional test will not distort the revised curriculum.  It will be focused on the expected levels of literacy and numeracy at transfer  age in a manner that does not require either a skewing of the curriculum or  prior practice. It should be taken on a single day, and last no more than one  hour. It should rank children on the basis of ability within the cohort sitting  it. It is my intention that such a test will be taken in the post-primary  setting, not in the primary school. For too long, the primary curriculum has  been distorted by the unnecessary testing of our children. That is the  difference between the transitional test and the transfer test. The  transitional test is also different to the sort of test that a number of  grammar schools claim that they will carry out, not only in the flexibility  that it indicates on my part, but in its regard for the education of children  in primary schools.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Let me be clear, the test that I propose is a concession in  the interest of consensus, and it is a means to an end &mdash; the end of academic  selection.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Never.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I propose that this test operates for a three-year period,  during which its application within admissions will reduce. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order, please. The Minister has the Floor. She is entitled to be  heard.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Yes, I have heard &ldquo;never&rdquo; on many previous occasions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to return to the issue of the test. Grammar schools  will have time to adjust; however, many are going with the new proposals. I  will welcome the decision of any grammar school which chooses not to use the  test. No child will be compelled to take the test. I have reluctantly conceded  the test, because I consider it to be an unfortunate necessity on the route to  the abolition of academic selection. If political debates suggest to me that  the test is not a necessary means towards that end, I will be delighted.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>:  As the Minister knows, my party and I acknowledge the need for change. As a  former teacher, I know that there is extreme confusion among pupils, teachers  and parents about what changes are being brought about. Will the Minister  explain exactly what information her Department is providing to primary  schools?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Go raibh maith agat as an cheist sin. We have been out and about  visiting schools and holding public meetings right across the North of Ireland.  I plan to continue doing so. I met all the post-primary principals in  Fermanagh. Last week, I was in Ballinascreen, where we held a public meeting.  We have held many different meetings so that we can have a genuine discussion  about the proposals.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department and I have clearly said to primary  principals and to teachers of P6 pupils that they must teach the revised  curriculum. I do not know how much clearer I can be. There is a revised  curriculum in place, which is a good curriculum. Yesterday, as I was going to  the match in Dublin, a teacher told me that the revised curriculum is working.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have also met all the different trade unions &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  More resources?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Of course, people want more resources, and we are doing  everything that we can to ensure that education gets the resources that it  needs. My colleagues are ensuring that we have those resources.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We have also written to school principals to explain that  they have a statutory duty to teach the revised curriculum.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Does the Minister intend to name and shame those schools which attempt to help  their pupils in the new test? Will she publicly publish a target list of  schools that she thinks are likely to default on the issue? Will she give an  assurance to the House that she intends to set up surveillance cameras in every  school so that she can pick out the teachers who do not do what she wants? In  practice, will she use the so-called anti-terrorism laws under the Regulation  of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 to ensure that every teacher does exactly what  she says?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Although the Member asked about 20 different questions, I have  already answered his question about what I will do, and I have explained what  the inspectorate and the teachers&rsquo; unions will do. If the Member had listened,  he might have got his answer. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order, please. I must ask Members again to allow the Minister to  answer the question.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Have you finished giving your response, Minister?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Yes, I have finished.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Does the Minister agree that  instead of taking action and sanctions against schools, she should be  apologising to schools &mdash;</p>

	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Does the Minister agree that she should be apologising for the consternation in  schools where parents are asking principals for advice on the Ruane 11-plus,  and where principals are unable to answer those questions?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister agree that she has left parents and  teachers in an invidious position, which has been made worse by her failure to  attend Executive meetings?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I do not agree with any of the points that the Member has made. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span> Until I came into this job, I thought that  the SDLP were anti-academic selection and pro-change.

	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have been highly supportive of the extended schools  programme. The bid for &pound;5 million, which was originally logged in the June  monitoring round, has been re-submitted in the September monitoring round. The  earlier bid was not met by the Finance Minister. However, in his statement to  the Assembly on 24 June 2008 on the outcome of the June monitoring round he  assured Members that every effort would be made to provide additional funding  for the extended schools programme at the next monitoring round. I look forward  to that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In light of those positive indications about the potential  to meet the bid for &pound;5 million, I wrote to the current Finance Minister to  outline the fact that I had asked my officials to put arrangements in place to  ensure that additional allocations were made in July to allow for school  planning and continuity of the programme. The Finance Minister welcomed that  course of action in his reply but highlighted that the scope for the Executive  to meet that bid in the September round would depend on the amount of funding  available for reallocation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have been delighted to receive letters of support and  thanks from school principals and pupils for the restoration of previous  funding levels and widening eligibility criteria.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  Will the Minister confirm how schools are being identified as in need of  funding and what level of funding is expected?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Go raibh maith agat. Priority for funding has been given to  schools serving areas of greatest social disadvantage, and it has been targeted  at children and young people who are disadvantaged, marginalised, or who have  the most limited access to current services. The additional &pound;5 million funding  means that we can restore previous years&rsquo; funding levels for 2008-09 and  reintroduce those wards, identified as being the most deprived under the  education domain, to the selection criteria. The education domain measure had  been used in 2006-07 and 2007-08. However, due to the reduced level of funding,  the multiple-deprivation measure has been adopted for 2008-09.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Schools eligible for the programme are as follows. Primary,  post-primary and special schools are eligible for the programme if: 51% or more  of their enrolment is from a neighbourhood renewal area; 51% or more of their  enrolment is from the 30% lowest ranking wards in the multiple-deprivation  measure; 51% or more of their enrolment is from the 30% lowest-ranking wards in  the education domain, or if they have a free school meals entitlement of 37% or  higher.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Nursery schools are also eligible for the programme if they  have 37% or more children who are entitled to free school meals and/or 37% or  more pupils&rsquo; families claiming jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Schools are being allocated funding amounts of between  &pound;5,500 and &pound;48,000, depending on their size and the uptake of the clustering  incentive. Funding was decided on the basis of a formula as follows: first,  there would be a block allocation to every school of &pound;3,000; secondly, there  would be a sliding-scale whereby the first 100 pupils are funded at &pound;100 each;  the next 100 at &pound;75 each; the next 100 at &pound;50 each; the next 150 at &pound;25; the  next 100 at &pound;20 each; and the remainder at &pound;10 each. Where schools join with  other schools in a cluster arrangement, they will be entitled to a 15%  additional allowance as an incentive for partnership working.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  Will the Minister, while she is on her feet, tell us how many times she has  been in her Department? This is my only opportunity as an elected  representative to ask a question of the Minister as she refuses to meet me in  my constituency. I make no apology for repetitiveness in asking the question,  although I may be accused by a certain member of Sinn F&eacute;in of being obsessed;  apparently when you speak about one subject you are obsessed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister indicate when we are going to see a  newbuild for Tor Bank School for special needs? The Minister talked eloquently  about equality and therefore, I would like to know when that newbuild will  commence? The state of the shanty town that currently acts as a school is an  absolute disgrace to the Department of Education and to the Minister in  particular.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I have met with the Member on a number of occasions; however,  her supplementary question is not relevant to the initial question. I ask that  in future the Member&rsquo;s questions be relevant &mdash;there are rules governing that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have visited Tor Bank School &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:  Order, order. I know that it is not popular to suspend people from schools any  more but somebody is going to get suspended here if you do not respect the  Chair.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: In relation to Tor Bank School, I will write to the Member with  the information, as I have done before. I have visited Tor Bank School.  Tremendous work is being done there, and I pay tribute to the principal and the  staff.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  Is the Minister aware that her failure to properly fund the extended schools  programme through the education budget &mdash; and I am talking about schools that  are in areas of high deprivation &mdash; has done irreparable damage to many  projects?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I think that the Member has left out some information. There  were four Departments funding the children and young persons&rsquo; package: the  Department for Social Development (DSD); the Department of Education; the  Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, and the Department of  Culture, Arts and Leisure. In the Department of Education, we mainstreamed a  sizeable proportion of the extended schools budget. I asked the then Minister  of Finance and Personnel for more money for extended schools; I wrote to him on  many occasions outlining my concerns about the cutting of that programme, and  that is on record. Thankfully, we have managed to mainstream a large section of  the extended schools programme in the Department of Education, and we have,  hopefully, managed to get extra money. I look forward to DSD funding the  projects that it is also responsible for.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Area-Based Planning Groups</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">6. <strong>Mr  McCarthy </strong>asked the Minister of Education for an update on the work of the  area based planning groups.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO182/09> (AQO  182/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I have been in regular contact with the chairperson of the  central group for area-based planning and, in my view, an excellent start has  been made on that important exercise. The chairperson and vice-chairperson of  the central group, and the five chairpersons of the local area groups, have had  a series of meetings to reach a shared understanding of the exercise and to  prepare discussion papers for consideration by the central group.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The central group met on 27 June and on 4 September; a  further meeting will take place in early October. Initial guidance on the  process of seeking submissions has been agreed and will be issued in the near  future. Nominations have been received for the five area groups and a two-day  residential meeting, which will allow them to analyse the available data and  identify the key issues in their respective areas, will begin on 30 September.  I have requested an interim progress report from the central group by the end  of October.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the meantime, I have been meeting principals in all  parts of the North; I have had meetings with many of the principals in  Fermanagh, and this week I am meeting some of the principals in County Down.  For the first time ever in the North of Ireland, we have all the different  education sectors sitting down together and planning on an area basis, rather  than, as in the past, all the sectors &mdash; the Catholic sector, the Irish-medium  sector, the integrated sector &mdash; meeting separately. As part of the review of  public administration (RPA) I have regularly chaired a high-level group made up  of all the different sectors so that we can move towards area-based planning.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  Is the Minister aware that she is already six months behind schedule with her  programme? Has she given any steer or advice to the area-based planning groups  to help them to maximise the potential for outside organisations to use schools  after school hours for community activities?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Minister to be very brief as we have moved beyond the  30-minute limit for questions to the Minister of Education.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: As I have stated, I am very pleased with the progress that has  been made. I pay tribute to the chairperson and the vice-chairperson of the  central group, who are doing tremendous work. While others may have been on  holiday, they were working away, and I place my appreciation to them on record.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Schools have an enormous role to play in local communities,  and that is part of post-primary area-based planning and the area-based  planning process that the Department will introduce. The more that buildings  and resources are maximised and the more that Departments work together, the  better.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I appear to be getting some help on how best to chair the meeting.  The 30-minute period ended while the Minister was answering, and I permitted a  further two minutes to allow her to conclude. This is in line with the  Speaker&rsquo;s ruling.</p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="5"></a>Employment And Learning</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">St Mary&rsquo;s University College: Enrolment</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mr  Armstrong </strong>asked the Minister for Employment and Learning how many students  entered St. Mary&rsquo;s University College in each of the past five years. <a name=AQO163/09>(AQO 163/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning (Sir Reg Empey)</strong>: The number of first enrolments at  St Mary&rsquo;s University College in each of the past five academic years for which  data are available are: 350 in 2002-03; 360 in 2003-04; 295 in 2004-05; 310 in  2005-06; and 365 in 2006-07.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Armstrong</strong>:  Is it true that had previous trends been allowed to continue, teacher training  would have ceased to be the main activity at St Mary&rsquo;s University College and  Stranmillis University College?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: The way that things were going, there was a risk  that in two to three years, non-teacher training would have been the main  activity at not only St Mary&rsquo;s University College but at Stranmillis University  College. Given that both colleges have built significant reputations in initial  teacher education, I felt strongly that it was important to ensure that that  was the key ethos at not only St Mary&rsquo;s but at Stranmillis. I hope that we can steer  things firmly in that direction in the Department&rsquo;s discussions with the  college and with the Minister of Education.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. The Minister is aware of a case that  arose in my constituency earlier this year regarding the sudden death of Shauna  McCann, a student who attended Liverpool Hope University. At the start of this  new academic year, have any provisions been made to advise students and to  protect them from being tied into payments for accommodation if they have to  leave third-level education through illness &mdash; mental or physical &mdash; or, in the  case of Shauna, because of a tragic death? As the Minister knows, the letting  agents have pursued her parents relentlessly for outstanding rent.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: Although that matter is not specific to the  question, the Member asked me about it before the summer recess. He raised it  in a debate or through a question, and I believe that we have corresponded on  the matter. I am sympathetic to the particular case that he drew to my  attention. All Members find it a sad case, and I am sorry to hear that the  family is continuing to be traumatised. However, it was a matter for civil law.  I will ask the Department to examine the Member&rsquo;s point, and I will write to  him after the record has been reviewed.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  St Mary&rsquo;s University College has an exceptional profile: it attracts students  from lower socio-economic backgrounds, it has high entry requirements, and,  despite the recent uncertainty, it succeeded in filling all its student places  this year. Given that profile, the history of the college, and the affection in  which it is held, how can the Minister credibly argue that the potential  expansion of the University of Ulster&rsquo;s York Street campus &mdash; as yet  unannounced, unfunded and uncertain &mdash; would put St Mary&rsquo;s University College,  which offers a highly appealing degree in liberal arts, at great risk? He made  that argument during an Assembly debate on teacher training on 23 June 2008.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: The activities of other institutions are relevant,  particularly those that are located nearby. However, no one doubts the  excellent record of achievement of St Mary&rsquo;s University College. It has  succeeded, and marginally surpassed other institutions, in attracting students  from difficult socio-economic backgrounds. Indeed, all Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  institutions have a better overall record in that area than most in GB.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">No institution is an island, and, therefore, every event is  relative. The students&rsquo; feedback on their experience at St Mary&rsquo;s University  College has been extremely positive, and we should concentrate on the positive.  In consultation with the Minister of Education, the Department is examining the  entire ambit of issues that affect the college, and discussions over the past  months have been good. An excellent debate was held in the Assembly, and the  issues are rapidly becoming clear. If the issues surrounding particular areas  of continuous professional development can be resolved, the college undoubtedly  has a very positive future.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Hearing-Impaired People: Training Opportunities</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr Lunn </strong>asked  the Minister for Employment and Learning what steps he is taking to improve  access to training for people with hearing impairments. &nbsp; <a name=AQO204/09>(AQO 204/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I apologise in advance for my rather long answer  to the question, but it is important to address the issues fully.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A range of measures and initiatives is in place to provide  and improve support for people with disabilities, including those with hearing  impairments, to access training. Among those measures is a register of support  providers that is available to all disabled students in higher education and  colleges of further education, and through which a range of support services,  including sign-language interpreters, can be provided.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department secured &pound;1&middot;3 million through the  comprehensive spending review to enhance the provision of both British and  Irish sign-language tutors and interpreters in Northern Ireland. Moreover, as  recommended by the Committee for Employment and Learning when it was  scrutinising the Training for Success programme, my Department established a  working group, which includes representatives from disability organisations and  which carried out a review that focused on the needs of people with  disabilities in the context of the provision of Training for Success. The group  recently submitted its report to the Department, and to increase access to that  training provision for people with disabilities, including those with hearing  impairments, I will ensure that all its recommendations are considered.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his comprehensive answer. What measures can be taken to  ensure that interpreters who support deaf learners in further and higher  education are of an adequate standard, and are monitored?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: A range of measures in the further education  sector is in place to provide support for students with hearing impairments,  depending on the degree of impairment and the nature of the course. Those  measures include signers, the provision of hearing induction loops, assistance  from note takers and the availability of lecture notes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">To ensure that my Department does everything possible to  help learners with disabilities, the Education and Training Inspectorate was  asked to review the provision of services and to identify any gaps. I hope that  that comprehensive review will be able to identify any weaknesses. The  Education and Training Inspectorate is thorough and, in consultation with  groups connected with those who have hearing impairments, it is happier now  that at least some additional provision is being made. I sound one note of  caution: only a finite number of tutors can train the trainers. That bottleneck  in training must be addressed, but the Department is fully aware that it  exists.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I, too, thank the Minister for his comprehensive and extremely helpful answer.  Earlier today, in the Long Gallery, there was a presentation from the National  Deaf Children&rsquo;s Society (NDCS). Those young people, some of whom used sign  language, spoke extremely well.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I raise that point because that organisation&rsquo;s knowledge  would be helpful for the Minister&rsquo;s proposed review. What discussions has the  Department had with the NDCS to ascertain what it feels should be part of the  review process? Such discussions would be helpful.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I thank the Member for his contribution. I agree  that the people whom we met that day were impressive; they were also keen to  point out issues that do not often register with us. For instance, people with  hearing impairments who go to see a doctor at a hospital are perhaps unable to  point out some obvious mistakes. As we all know, mistakes can happen, so that  is a serious issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The review will include everyone who is deeply involved in  such matters. The Department already provides funding to Belfast Metropolitan  College in order to increase the number of fully qualified sign-language  interpreters. As I said earlier, one area on which we will concentrate is the  question of who trains the trainers. We will consult NDCS. It is essential that  the review comes to an early conclusion, given that there has been a backlog;  we want to get the outcome of the review to the colleges as quickly as  possible.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The previous Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure was  helpful in that our Departments worked together on the issue. The Department&rsquo;s  Disablement Advisory Service provides a range of programme support to help  people with disabilities, and Access to Work helps them to obtain suitable  employment. Therefore, I am confident that a process is in place that will lead  to the correct measures being implemented. The fact that we received extra  funding through the comprehensive spending review was also helpful.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his comprehensive answer. What steps will the Minister  take to ensure that the number of sign-language interpreters will be  significantly increased, given the bottleneck to which he referred? What  assistance can be provided for people who require extra aid in a job interview?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: In my earlier response, I said that my Department  had secured an extra &pound;1&middot;3 million in the CSR, specifically to increase the  number of people who are trained. Under the communication-support-at-interview  process, the Department, through the Disablement Advisory Service, will meet  the cost of providing communication support at employment interviews for people  who are deaf or who have hearing disabilities. In other words, the Department  will send and pay for someone to go to an interview with an applicant so that  the applicant has the necessary support and help to conduct a proper interview,  which will level the playing field for that individual. I confirm that the  Disablement Advisory Service will do that and will pay for it.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Members who were due to ask questions 3 and 4 are not in their  places.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Global Economic Downturn</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mr Neeson </strong>asked the Minister for Employment and Learning if he has reviewed his  strategy for sectors to target in light of the global economic downturn.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO203/09>(AQO 203/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: My Department has commissioned a forecast of  future skill needs in Northern Ireland based on short-, medium- and long-term  economic predictions. In conjunction with other forms of labour market  information, that will inform the Department&rsquo;s decision on whether it will be  necessary to review the sectors that it targets for future skill work.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>:  We all recognise the complexities of the global economy, but will the Minister  consider developing skills academies or apprenticeship academies, as has  happened in other parts of the UK? Will he consider the development of  industrial hubs?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I have no doubt that the Member is aware that the  Department has a skills expert group and workforce development forums, which  have been established to bring together the providers of education through the  colleges and local employers to ascertain the needs in any particular area.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department has an agreement with 23 of the 25 sector  skills councils in Northern Ireland. They have a key responsibility to ensure  that qualifications are of a high standard and meet the needs of local  employers.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must consider future plans for academies. We have,  potentially, an important structure in place, whereby the applicants and the  sector skills councils work in conjunction with the colleges and local  employers. In the northern region and the Ballymena area, Michelin &mdash; one of the  large employers &mdash; has a training centre in the local college. That could be  described as a centre of excellence. However, it is a matter of opinion whether  that can be defined as an academy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Given how international labour markets have changed in the  past couple of months, we must examine closely the whole gamut of prioritising  skills for the future, because the situation today differs from that of six  months ago. I thought, perhaps, that the Member was driving at that point.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Newton</strong>:  The Minister stated previously in the House that he will introduce a demand-led  strategy; given that, Mr Neeson&rsquo;s point is well made. Sectors of the Northern  Ireland economy are buoyant, yet employers cannot recruit qualified graduates.  Those shortages are, generally, in the science, technology, engineering and  mathematics (STEM) areas. Will the Minister outline what steps he will take to  meet graduate demand from engineering and technology companies?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: Two weeks ago, I attended Queen&rsquo;s University&rsquo;s  open day, and I visited the Bernard Crossland Building, which houses  engineering and technology activity. In the current year, that university  filled its places in the broad STEM areas, although I am unsure of the  situation at the University of Ulster. However, I accept entirely the concept  of a demand-led process.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">At the end of 2007, the Department launched the &lsquo;C&rsquo;Mon  Over&rsquo; initiative, through which we will visit various university campuses &mdash;  many, in fact, this month &mdash; in the United Kingdom, and we will visit Dublin in  late 2008 or early 2009. Employers will accompany us to try to convince  students who have trained in universities in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Newcastle,  Liverpool, Dublin and Dundee to return to employment in Northern Ireland. Those  employers will offer real jobs to students. The Department wants to recover  skilled students who have left Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A combination of that process, work in schools and efforts  to encourage more children to study STEM subjects, such as Queen&rsquo;s University&rsquo;s  decision to offer bursaries &mdash; and the University of Ulster is considering that,  too &mdash; will improve the situation. People take key decisions at the age of 13 that  determine which subjects they can learn in future. It is a comprehensive  proposal, and I assure the Member that I am focused on ensuring its delivery.  As the Member realises, that is the only way to retain a competitive position.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>:  What role do the skills expert group and the workforce development forums play?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: Workforce development forums are based around the  six regions in which the principal colleges of further education are located.  They provide meeting places for the colleges of further education and local  business communities. It is as easy and cost effective for colleges to teach  qualifications with positive outcomes to students as it is to teach  qualifications for which there are no jobs. Therefore, it makes sense &mdash; for the  colleges and the students &mdash; that people are supplied with the skills that are  needed by the local communities and employers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A further initiative is the all-island skills conference  that will focus on border areas, and it will take place in early October 2008  in the north-west. The conference will be hosted jointly by the Northern  Ireland skills expert group and the expert group on future skill needs. It is a  joint operation with my counterparts in the Republic &mdash; I believe that T&aacute;naiste  Mary Coughlan will be one of the Ministers involved. In that context, we are  seeking to have the right mix of labour-market intelligence present so that  colleges in the border regions can ensure that the skills and qualifications  being taught there match the needs of local communities. I encourage all  employers to become involved, because they will find it useful.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Stranmillis University College: Merger</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">6. <strong>Mrs  Hanna </strong>asked the Minister for Employment and Learning if he is satisfied  that Stranmillis University College fully considered all options, for its  future, prior to the decision of its board of governors to endorse a proposal  to merge with Queen&rsquo;s University Belfast.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO149/09>(AQO  149/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: The governing body of Stranmillis University  College made the decision, in principle, to merge with Queen&rsquo;s University,  Belfast. That decision was based on the consideration of options arising from  the Taylor Report on the long-term strategic options for Stranmillis University  College, which was published in July 2007. The governing body voted unanimously  for the option.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Any decision to merge will require the consent of my  Department. We will conduct a rigorous evaluation process that will include the  setting out of all options, and the decision will be subject to the  consideration and approval of the Committee for Employment and Learning and the  Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>:  The Minister approved two-year conversion funding in respect of student numbers  for Stranmillis and St Mary&rsquo;s. As he said, that will create space so that all  issues can be explored.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister understand why Stranmillis and Queen&rsquo;s  told the Committee for Employment and Learning that they plan to make their  decision for merger in 2009? Will he confirm that he will not consider  accelerated passage for any legislation concerning the matter?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: The answer to the Member&rsquo;s second question is yes.  In response to the first question, I was promised that the business case would  be available in July 2008. I have not received it yet, and I understand that it  will be some weeks before it comes into my possession. The Department has not  had the opportunity to see the business case yet.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When the business case is received, it will go through a rigorous  evaluation process that will include, by definition, consideration of all the  options. After that is done, we will consult with other Departments that have a  keen interest. We will then come to a view and discuss it with the Committee.  It will be a matter for the House to deal with any legislation that flows from  that, because the merger cannot take place without legislation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I already gave an undertaking to the Committee for  Employment and Learning that I will not be seeking accelerated passage for the  process. I cannot be specific about the timetable, but my view of the process &mdash;  which I highlighted at a meeting with representatives from the college and the  university before the summer break and which I clarified twice in writing &mdash; is  that it is nearly October and I have not received the report, and that time is  rapidly running out. The practicalities dictate that it will not be possible to  complete the process within the time available. It is up to the college and the  university to submit their case. I will deal with the case when they submit it.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>:  The Minister will be aware that the day before the Stranmillis University  College board of governors made its announcement, its representatives gave a  presentation to the Committee for Employment and Learning, and, to say the  least, everyone on the Committee was convinced that a deal had been done prior  to that meeting.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is strange that there was only one option on the table.  Can the Minister confirm whether the Stranmillis board of governors considered  all other options, and is it not the case that the University of Ulster, which  was also thought to be a player in the process, pulled out because it knew that  a deal had been done with Queen&rsquo;s University&rsquo;s board of governors prior to the  meeting at which the decision was supposed to have been made?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I cannot confirm all that the Member said, but he  raised questions that I know have exercised his mind and the minds of Committee  members.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee took evidence from the University of Ulster&rsquo;s  vice chancellor and others, and met Stranmillis University College  representatives, about which the Member will form his own opinion. All that I  can say is that the college&rsquo;s board must take the initiative. If the college  has a proposal, as I have indicated, we will consider all the options, which  must be set out in detail.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I make it clear to the Committee &mdash; and I repeat for the  second or third time &mdash; that there will be no attempt by my Department to  steamroller anything through the House. It is not my fault if the proposal  comes to me late. I have made it clear that there is a process, and the process  will be adhered to. Given that I must review the options that were considered,  some matters that the Member raised may emerge when I receive the business  case.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Stranmillis University College board of governors  commissioned the Taylor Report, which was published in 2007, and although it  was not terribly specific, nevertheless, at that stage, the board was already  considering options. However, that is a matter for the college&rsquo;s board. When  the Department is asked, it will deal with the matter, and it will seek  legislative consent from the Assembly for a full and proper Bill, which must  pass through all Stages in the House before any changes to that institution&rsquo;s  status can take place. The Assembly will have the final say on the matter, and  I hope that that reassures the Member.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: Since  2003, a review into teacher education in Northern Ireland has been under way,  and I believe that a draft review document was provided for the stakeholders&rsquo;  group in January 2008. For the benefit of all concerned, will the Minister  inform Members about the review&rsquo;s progress and clarify the Department for  Employment and Learning&rsquo;s position on teacher training?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: The Member is correct about the timescale, and  that concerns me. As the Member is aware, the review is a joint effort with the  Department of Education, and I recently wrote to the Minister of Education to  seek clarity on when her Department will conclude its deliberations. My  Department has signed off on the latest draft, and I await a response from the  Department of Education.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I accept that the review has taken far too long.  Nevertheless, during the Christmas holidays last year, I saw an earlier draft,  and the final report will be an important piece of work, containing some  excellent proposals, which I am sure that Members will be pleased to see on  publication. I am conscious of the need to get the report into the public  domain as soon as possible, and I await a response from the Minister of  Education.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Stranmillis University College: Enrolment</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">7. <strong>Mr  McFarland </strong>asked the Minister for Employment and Learning how many students  entered Stranmillis University College in each of the past five years. <a name=AQO164/09>(AQO 164/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: The first-year enrolments to Stranmillis  University College for each of the past five academic years for which data are  available are: 460 in 2002-03; 435 in 2003-04; 480 in 2004-05; 395 in 2005-06;  and 385 in 2006-07.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McFarland</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer. If the merger goes ahead, what are the  implications for Queen&rsquo;s University of having all those extra students? Are  there savings implications? When did the Minister first become aware that  Queen&rsquo;s University and Stranmillis University College were seeking a merger?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I formally became aware of a merger on 17 April  2008, when a decision was taken. I knew that a merger was an option that was  being considered.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The implications are fairly far-reaching. In Northern  Ireland, there are five providers of initial teacher education: Queen&rsquo;s  University, the two university colleges, the Open University and the University  of Ulster. Queen&rsquo;s University and Stranmillis University College tell me that  they envisage a centre of inter&shy;national excellence. The absorption of that  number of students into Queen&rsquo;s University will be a significant development.  Further details will appear in the proposals that will be put to me by Queen&rsquo;s  University and Stranmillis University College. That issue will be taken into  consideration by the Department in reaching a recommendation on the way ahead.  The Committee for Employment and Learning and the Assembly will have the final  say on any proposals.</p>

	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Marching Season: Contribution to Tourism</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mr  Moutray </strong>asked the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment what her  assessment is of the contribution of this year&rsquo;s marching season to tourism.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO191/09> (AQO 191/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment (Mrs Foster)</strong>: There has been no formal  assessment of the impact of the marching season on tourism, but the Northern  Ireland Tourist Board and Tourism Ireland are in regular touch with  representatives of the Loyal Orders to see how events such as the Twelfth of  July parades can be developed as tourist attractions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Northern Ireland Tourist Board worked with the Orange  Order to help to broaden the appeal of this year&rsquo;s Twelfth of July  demonstrations and identified four flagship parades &mdash; Belfast, Tandragee,  Dromara and Coleraine &mdash; as those with the most potential appeal to visitors.  The Northern Ireland Tourist Board provided &ldquo;welcome host&rdquo; training for  stewards at those parades.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Tourism Ireland also helped to raise the profile of this  year&rsquo;s parades; for example, its website had a link to the BBC&rsquo;s live coverage  of the Twelfth. I understand that considerable interest was generated, and I am  optimistic that such events have the potential to make a real contribution to  the Northern Ireland tourism product.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Moutray</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her answer. I know that she is a family-oriented  person, and I hope that she, like me, enjoyed a family day out at one of the  Twelfth spectaculars this year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Will she indicate whether any representative from the  Northern Ireland Tourist Board or Tourism Ireland took the opportunity to  attend a Twelfth of July celebration in an official capacity?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: I thank the Member for his question. I  availed of the tremendous family day at Kesh&rsquo;s Twelfth of July celebrations. I  met many visitors who had travelled up Lough Erne to be in Kesh for the  festivities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Representatives from the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and  Tourism Ireland attended the Twelfth of July parade in Coleraine and will be  meeting Orange Order representatives to provide feedback. The Orange Order has  expressed its thanks to the tourist authorities for the advice that it has  received to date.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Given the contribution that local  historical and cultural events can make to tourism by exploiting the uniqueness  of the North, will the Minister detail what plans her Department has to ensure  that the Tourist Board will supply funding and resources to local  community-based tourism projects that promote such events? I have in mind  places such as west Belfast, where such projects have been organised for years.  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: I thank the Member for her question.  Indeed, earlier this year, I attended a very good fair day at Irvinestown in  Fermanagh. I assume that that is the type of small-scale cultural event to  which the Member refers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A cultural tourism strategy was commissioned by the Tourist  Board in March 2005, and it is currently being developed. The draft Northern  Ireland Tourist Board corporate plan for 2008-11 also identifies cultural and  heritage tourism as a key product development priority.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Tourist Board is developing a cultural and heritage  tourism product framework that covers four broad areas &mdash; heritage, living  culture, creative and the arts &mdash; all of which are further divided into subcategories.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A great wealth of cultural activity exists that can act as  a stimulus for the tourism market. I look forward to seeing the plans develop.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  Although I acknowledge and commend the Orange Order&rsquo;s initial efforts to engage  with the Catholic community, does the Minister agree that if the Orange Order  is serious about turning the Twelfth and other parades into tourist events, it  will have to revise fundamentally what it represents to the Catholic community,  including its written principles? Does she also agree that it will have to  revise the culture associated with those parades, which includes alcohol and  bonfires? I note that DRD has estimated that it costs &pound;60,000 to clean up such  bonfires.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: I am not here to be a spokesperson for  the Orange Order, however it should be noted that that organisation is based on  the reformed Protestant faith, and, as such, it is fundamental to that  organisation to promote that faith, so I do not see its principles changing any  time soon.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to the Member&rsquo;s other comments, particularly  the one about alcohol, I know that the Order has been working very closely with  the police and I encourage them to keep doing that and to eradicate the abuse  of alcohol at the parades. I know that, as well as anything else, such  behaviour is a blight on those parades.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Bed and Breakfasts: Joint Grading System</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr  Armstrong </strong>asked the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment what  communication he has had with his counterpart in the Republic of Ireland  concerning a joint grading system for bed and breakfasts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO184/09> (AQO 184/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: I have not discussed that issue with my  counterpart in the Irish Republic. My officials are currently engaged in a  review of the certification and classification of tourist accommodation in  Northern Ireland. As part of that exercise, they will consider best practice in  England, Scotland, Wales and the Republic of Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Armstrong</strong>:  I presume that the Minister has done some research into the Scottish tourist  board&rsquo;s experience of accommodation grading?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: The question was in relation to the  Republic of Ireland, and I want to cover the differences between here and that  jurisdiction. We in Northern Ireland have the only statutory certification for  bed and breakfasts &mdash; nowhere else in the British Isles has that. Therefore, we  have set minimum standards that are very important and that are recognised by  people when they visit bed and breakfasts here.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Work has being going on in the rest of the United Kingdom  in relation to classification, and a new voluntary code has been set up. We  have been examining such work closely and will continue to do that, because a  review of the issue of classification is pending. We hope to be able to publish  the consultation about the new classification in January 2009.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  The Minister probably approved the recent sale of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  electricity system operator to the system operator in the South. That means  that power stations will, ultimately, be controlled from a single control room  in Dublin, and there will be one system operator for the island. Does the  Minister agree that it is a sign of our growing political maturity that we in  the North are now comfortable with having our power switched on and off from a  location in Dublin? Will she confirm also that she supports a logical,  all-island &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: The original question was about  bed-and-breakfast classification; I am not sure what the single electricity  market has to do with that.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  There seems to be some confusion in the Chamber &mdash; I thought that it was only  the Minister&rsquo;s gender that had been confused in the original question. Last  week a by-election was held in Enniskillen during which the Ulster Unionist  Party tried to gift a seat to Sinn F&eacute;in; now it seems that they are wishing to  gift our bed-and-breakfast classification system to the Irish Republic as well  &mdash; I hope that the Minister defends that as stoutly as she defended the seat in  Enniskillen.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The majority of tourists who travel to Northern Ireland  come from Great Britain. Therefore, does the Minister agree that, if a  joint-classification or joint-grading system for bed-and-breakfast  accommodation is needed, it would be better to have a system in conjunction  with our colleagues in GB, rather than with those in the Irish Republic?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: I was quite amused by the fact that Mr  Armstrong referred to me as &ldquo;he&rdquo; in his question. However, given the Ulster  Unionists&rsquo; role in last week&rsquo;s by-election, I suppose that I should not be  surprised.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Both jurisdictions on this island operate from very  different starting points. As I have already indicated, we have a statutory  system of certification that is very important for our standards, and that  system is jealously looked upon by colleagues in the Republic of Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member is correct. Most of our visitor potential for  bed and breakfasts comes from GB. Therefore, it makes sense that we should have  a similar classification system to the rest of the United Kingdom. I will  certainly bear that in mind.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind Members that supplementary questions should be relevant.  I also remind Members that, when the Minister has the Floor, she must be  allowed to be heard.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Marine Renewable Energy</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Mr  Shannon </strong>asked the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment what action  she is taking to support marine renewable energy in coastal areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO213/09>(AQO 213/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">15. <strong>Mr  McCarthy </strong>asked the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment for an  update on the Strangford Lough wave energy project.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO230/09> (AQO 230/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Invest&shy;ment</strong>: With your permission, Mr Deputy Speaker,  I will answer questions 3 and 15 together. Northern Ireland has a significant  tidal stream resource, and harnessing that resource is an important element of  my Department&rsquo;s ongoing work to increase the use of renewables.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That was recently demonstrated with the 1&middot;2 mega&shy;watt  marine-current turbine project &mdash;SeaGen &mdash; which began generating renewable  electricity in July 2008. It is the world&rsquo;s first commercial-scale tidal system  to be connected to a local grid. The deployment of the system at Strangford has  put Northern Ireland on the map for tidal-marine renewables, and that augurs  well for the exploitation of tidal resources off our north coast.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI)  is in the final stages of commissioning a strategic environmental assessment of  offshore wind and marine renewable energy in Northern Ireland waters. That will  enable DETI to work with the Crown Estate &mdash; owner of the seabed &mdash; to issue a  competitive call for private-sector investors in order to develop commercial  projects at certain offshore sites. The strategic environmental assessment,  including the consultation phases, will be completed by spring 2010.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the interim period, DETI, the Northern Ireland  Environment Agency and the Crown Estate will continue to work with developers  who wish either to deploy pre-commercial or demonstration-stage devices &mdash; such  as the marine-current turbines at Strangford Lough &mdash; or to prepare their  proposals before the competitive call for commercial projects in 2010.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I congratulate the Minister on her recent by-election success. Not only was she  able to win the election that day, but she was able to make supper for her wife  &mdash; sorry; for her husband &mdash; and her children. Furthermore, she was able to put  them to bed. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. Mr Shannon, you clearly did not hear a single word that I  said a few moments ago.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  The Minister has outlined part of the case for the turbine initiative at  Strangford Lough. Does her Department have any intention to encourage other  forms of marine renewable-energy production in other coastal areas? Areas such  as the Ards Peninsula or the east Antrim coast could perhaps be considered.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: As I indicated in my answer to the  initial question, the Department is working with the Crown Estate to identify  potential sites. The strategic environmental assessment that is under way will  allow us to see what potential exists. I believe that such potential does  exist, but we obviously need to have that assessment carried out before that  can be developed.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I also congratulate the Minister on her election success in Enniskillen. Well  done.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Minister for her detailed answer to the initial  question. Can the Minister assure the House that, when SeaGen is in full  production at Strangford Lough, the residents of Portaferry, Strangford and the  Ards Peninsula will benefit from low-energy electricity charges?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: As the Member knows, the technology is  most innovative, and that is something of which he and the people of that area  are very proud. Whether only the residents of Portaferry will be able to  benefit from lower energy costs is another matter. I hope that it will add to  our renewable energy and will help us to meet our targets for the coming years.  The Department will work closely with SeaGen and will look for other potential  renewables. As I have said, we have the potential to develop offshore wind and  marine renewable energy.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>

	      <p class="B3BodyText">Given the recent gas and electricity price rises &mdash; of which  the Minister is aware &mdash; and the sustainable energy market on the island of  Ireland, has she any plans to develop an all-Ireland energy market for  renewables?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: My Department is always looking for  opportunities to develop the renewable sector in Northern Ireland, and it will  continue to do so. However, there are difficulties with the cross-border energy  market, as the renewable support systems that are available in the United  Kingdom &mdash; and hence in Northern Ireland &mdash; are different from those in the  Republic of Ireland. The United Kingdom has levy-exemption certificates, while  the Republic of Ireland has a feed-in tariff. There are different  circumstances, and, therefore, cross-border working becomes increasingly  difficult.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, we are working with the Scottish Executive on  offshore wind and marine renewable energy, and I see great potential for  harnessing that renewable energy and making Northern Ireland a leader in that  field.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Consumerline</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mr B  McCrea </strong>asked the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment what efforts  have been made to promote Consumerline. <a name=AQO177/09>(AQO  177/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: My Department has undertaken a wide range  of marketing and promotional activities to raise awareness of Consumerline,  which encompasses the consumer telephone helpline and the website. Those  activities have included advertising on television, on radio and in newspapers  as well as more locally based awareness initiatives. Calls to Consumerline have  increased by 30% over the past three years, and hits on the website have  increased by 65% in the same period. In addition, customer satisfaction levels  with the helpline are, on average, 92%, and the estimated saving made by  Northern Ireland consumers as a result of contacting Consumerline is &pound;2 million  per annum.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Does the Minister agree that in the current dire economic climate the elderly  in our society are particularly vulnerable? It is particularly important to  find ways of making consumer information readily available to them, given the  fact that they may not be au fait with the Internet and such technologies.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: I could not agree with the Member more.  He will know that a wide range of advice networks are available. I have a long  list here, although I am sure that the Member does not want me to read it out.  However, it is right to target the advice, and I will ask my officials to reply  to him on that subject.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Newton</strong>: I  also congratulate the Minister on her by-election victory. In this dire  economic climate, that by-election &mdash; the result of which was inevitable &mdash;  should not have been called, and the expenses should not have been borne by the  ratepayers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the House last week, the Sinn F&eacute;in Member Mr John O&rsquo;Dowd  said:</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;I am led to understand that the Utility Regulator brought a  report on fuel price increases to the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment, and the Minister signed-off on that. Why did the Minister not block  those increases?&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Official Report, Vol 33, No 2, p81, col  2]</span>.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr O&rsquo;Dowd was speaking from a position of political  ignorance. Will the Minister comment on his misleading and inaccurate  statements?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: It was ignorance, and not the sort of  ignorance that I expect from Members. Everybody knows that the regulator is  independent. Therefore, I cannot direct or tell him what to do, nor can I  demand that he do x, y or z. However, I asked him whether he would consider  having a review of those price rises. I recognise that people outside, and  inside, the Chamber are worried about the price rises &mdash; particularly those for  electricity.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My Department has no role in determining energy prices. The  Department strives, in co-operation with the Utility Regulator, to create  market conditions that will drive down energy prices over the long term. In  light of concerns about the scale of the increase in electricity prices, I have  read the regulator&rsquo;s proposals about how best to ensure full public confidence in  the tariff-setting process. I am very pleased that the regulator responded  positively and that he has commissioned an independent review by the former  regulator Douglas McIldoon. Independence means no political interference and,  therefore, Mr McIldoon is independent.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  I am sure that Consumerline has been very busy since the announcement of the  33% hike in electricity prices. The Minister acknowledged public anxiety and  alarm since that announcement. Does she agree that public confidence in the  regulator has evaporated since the announcement? Does she also agree that her  Department has been deafeningly silent on the matter? Is it not the case that  the decision to appoint the previous regulator, Mr McIldoon, to review the  present incumbent, Mr Osborne, is a sign that, like the public, her Department  has no confidence in the current regulator?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: The Member cannot have it both ways &mdash;  either I have been proactive in asking for a review or I have been silent.  Which is it to be? I have accepted that there is an issue of public confidence,  and that is why I asked the regulator to consider a review, which he has done.  I am satisfied with the terms of reference of the review and with the person  who the regulator has asked to carry it out. I, along with most &mdash; if not all &mdash;  commentators acknowledge the independence of the gentleman who has been  appointed to carry out the review. That is vitally important, and I look  forward to the outcome of the review in due course.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Renewable Energy Sources</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mr Ford </strong>asked  the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment for her assessment of the  proportion of electricity that will be produced by renewable energy sources by  (i) 2010; and (ii) 2020.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO209/09> (AQO  209/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: Northern Ireland has around 6% renewable  electricity generated from indigenous sources. Our renewable electricity target  is for 12% renewable electricity by 2012. I fully expect that target to be met.  I am assessing the potential for renewable energy to make a greater  contribution to the generation mix, and I will consider an appropriate target  for Northern Ireland&rsquo;s renewable electricity for 2020. I plan to consult on  such a target next year, when the proposed EU directive on renewable energy &mdash;  including renewable energy consumption targets &mdash; is in its final form.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her response, although it did not entirely cover the  points that I was seeking to raise. I understand that experts assess the potential  limit for electricity generation from renewable energy sources in Northern  Ireland to be 42%. In the face of that, achieving 12% by 2012 is a low target.  Will the Minister indicate what she will do to promote micro-generation and  enhance infrastructure to ensure that the maximum possible benefits can be  gained from renewable energy, wherever it is generated in Northern Ireland?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: There has been some confusion; I am not  sure whether it is my confusion or the Member&rsquo;s. The 42% figure is the amount  of renewable energy that the grid can cope with in its current state. A report  on the grid was completed at the end of last year, and we must examine how the  infrastructure can be improved.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Northern Ireland has around 6% renewable electricity  generated from indigenous sources. Our renewable electricity generation target  is 12% for 2012, and I believe that we will meet that target. I think that the  Member understood that 42% is the potential limit for electricity generation  from renewable energy but, rather, that figure refers to the amount of  renewable energy that the grid can take. However, whether we need to upgrade  the grid is a different story.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. The Minister issued only a brief statement after meeting  the regulator, and she was not available to come to the Chamber when a Member  tried to put a priority written question to her. Does she not think that that  sent a signal to people in the North that she agreed with the regulator&rsquo;s  increase in electricity costs and that that led to a lot of questions? Although  the Minister cannot instruct or direct the regulator, could she not have sent  out a signal that she absolutely disagrees with a 33% rise in electricity  costs?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment</strong>: If the Member is referring to the questions for  priority written answer that the Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for  Enterprise, Trade and Investment submitted, let me point out that the answers  were returned within the time frame. I was very disappointed to hear the  comments that were made about that matter. The questions were tabled on 15  September, and the responses were to be back with the Business Office by 2.00  pm on 18 September. The answers were sent to the Business Office at 11.27 am on  18 September. Therefore, I am not sure what &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  It was a private Member&rsquo;s question.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: I was not made aware of any private  Member&rsquo;s question. It never came to me; therefore, I do not see how I can come  to the House to answer a question that was never given to me.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: For the umpteenth time, I ask Members to be quiet, please,  particularly when the Minister is speaking, and to direct their remarks through  the Chair. There has been a constant din this afternoon.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  Lest I forget, I also congratulate the Minister on her elevation to the role  and status of district councillor. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Is the Minister aware of the problems being experienced by  the operators of wind turbines, many of whom operate as individuals, in getting  competitive rates for their electricity when they supply it to the national  grid?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: I am aware of some difficulties around  competition in the single electricity market. I have already raised that issue  with the regulator, and I intend to pursue it with him. As the Member knows,  the single electricity market has been in existence only since November 2007,  and it has always been the case that the benefits would accrue in the long  term. However, I am a little concerned about some of the competitive aspects of  the market, and, as I said, I intend to pursue that issue with the regulator.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Single Natural Gas Market</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">6. <strong>Mr  Neeson </strong>asked the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment what plans  she has to develop a single natural gas market following the development of the  single electricity market.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO211/09>(AQO  211/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: My Department is working with the  Republic of Ireland&rsquo;s Department of Communications, Energy and Natural  Resources and with the two regulatory authorities to assess the economic  benefits of having common operating arrangements for the two gas transmission  networks. However, before any decision to proceed is taken, there will need to  be clear evidence that having common operating arrangements will bring tangible  benefits to consumers in Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The project under consideration is not the creation of a  wholesale trading market similar to the single electricity market. The aim is  to examine whether gas, the vast majority of which is piped from Great Britain,  can be bought and sold using common market conditions and signals such as a  single transmission tariff. That has the potential to bring more efficient  operation and open and transparent competition, and it could help to drive down  costs. It would be in line with EU objectives for the development of regional  gas markets.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>: I  thank the Minister for that positive answer. However, I seek clarification on  one point, which follows on from Mr O&rsquo;Dowd&rsquo;s comment. The Committee for  Enterprise, Trade and Investment has already held two long meetings to discuss  the current crisis that consumers are facing owing to rising energy prices. The  Committee will continue to deal with that issue, and Sinn F&eacute;in members of that  Committee are working closely with the other Committee members.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As the Minister is aware, the single electricity market has  recently been established. In fact, earlier today, David Ford and I met  representatives of Northern Ireland Electricity to discuss the proposed  North/South interconnector. Does she agree that there is a need to develop  greater competition, particularly in the gas and electricity markets, in order  to benefit consumers in Northern Ireland?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: I agree that greater competition is  needed. I will continue to keep a close eye on the matter, and that is why I  will continue to meet the regulator to express concerns. As the Member will  understand, that is all that I can do, because the regulator is independent.  However, the regulator is aware of that issue, and I know that he will raise it  with his counterpart in the Republic of Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I,  too, congratulate the Minister on her convincing victory in Fermanagh. However,  I am yet to be convinced about the benefits of the single electricity market.  Can the Minister tell me whether there will be any common arrangement for gas?</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: As I said, the plan is to have common  arrangements for gas that will potentially improve the flow of gas around the  two systems. The idea is to have &mdash; and to benefit from &mdash; operational efficiencies.  Therefore, we will not have a single market for wholesale gas. We intend to  have common arrangements that will benefit consumers in Northern Ireland and  the Republic of Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Renewable Energy</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">7. <strong>Mr  McGlone </strong>asked the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment to outline  what incentives are available to encourage or enable the generation, purchase  and supply of renewable energy on a cross-border basis.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO220/09>(AQO 220/09)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: Current incentives for renewable energy  development focus on electricity generation. In Northern Ireland, the  renewables obligation, which is known as NIRO, is the main support mechanism,  while the Irish Republic operates a feed-in tariff. Both incentives require the  electricity that is generated to be supplied in the jurisdiction that provides  the support &mdash; there is no cross-border dimension. However, there is no  indication that the issue of different support systems is a constraint on the  development of renewables across the island.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Northern Ireland is on target to meet its 2012 renewables  target. The key constraints beyond 2012 will be the limitations of our existing  grid infrastructure, which is a shared concern for Northern Ireland and the  Irish Republic.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her answer. If there is no viable single market for  electricity that is generated from renewable sources on the island, there will  be a requirement for cross-border subvention arrangements to be put in place in  order to create such a market. That is particularly important to us here. The  greatest source of renewable energy is based on the west coast of Ireland,  which is in the Republic. What will the Minister do to take full advantage of  that?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: As I said in my initial answer, the  different support systems do not seem to be having a detrimental impact on  renewable electricity. Therefore, I do not see the need to interfere if there  is no detriment to the electricity market.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The different approaches to incentivising renewables in  Northern Ireland and in the Republic of Ireland reflect the Republic of  Ireland&rsquo;s status as a separate member state with different renewable targets.  The Republic of Ireland has different targets to the UK. Therefore, it has decided  to move to a feed-in tariff, whereas we have decided against that, and, so far,  that has caused no difficulties. The development of renewable energy has grown  in Northern Ireland and in the Republic of Ireland, and we are on target to  meet our renewables targets for 2012.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. Time is up. That concludes Question Time.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. For clarification, I submitted a  private notice question to the Business Office on Monday, and at 5.00 pm that  evening, I was told that the Minister would not be available the following day.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: That has been noted.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: I was not informed of the private notice  question, and, quite frankly, I should have been. I will take up the matter  with the Business Office.</p>

	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Debate resumed on motion:</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly calls on the Minister of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety to introduce policies to reduce the level of Foetal  Alcohol Spectrum Disorder; where necessary co-operating with other agencies and  Departments; and to introduce dedicated teams to assist families affected by  Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder. &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Mr G Robinson.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  I have gone on record many times warning of the hidden costs of alcohol for the  National Health Service. Normally, those costs are associated with underage  drinking and the effects that that will have on the National Health Service in  the future. However, on this occasion, I am drawing attention to a disorder  that is also caused by alcohol, but that is often caused unwittingly and  without intent. I refer, of course, to the dangers that are posed by drinking  during pregnancy and to foetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), which is a  lifelong condition affecting one in 100 people in this country.</p>
	      <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr McClarty] in the Chair)</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That spectrum of disorder includes: foetal alcohol  syndrome, the symptoms of which include a small head or body, distinctive  facial characteristics and brain damage; foetal alcohol effects, including  symptoms such as behavioural disorders and attention deficits; alcohol-related  birth defects, which can include heart defects, sight and hearing problems and  joint anomalies; and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorders, including  attention deficits, behavioural disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is clear that that range of disorders creates lifelong  difficulties for sufferers and lifelong costs for the National Health Service.  I add my voice to those who have commended the work of the National  Organisation on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome-UK (NOFAS-UK), which has done so much  good work in support of FASD sufferers. Our role as an Assembly must be to  highlight the disorder and to tease out the issues that surround it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For instance, some geneticists who specialise in diagnosing  FASD believe that the rise in young children being diagnosed with attention  deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is because they are, in fact, suffering  from FASD. That misdiagnosis has a serious impact on the treatment and  assistance that are available to sufferers and their families. Most of those  children end up in foster care or are adopted. Often, they have behavioural  problems and can sometimes end up with criminal records.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is also a risk of recurrence of the condition in the  same family. One geneticist had reported seeing a family in which three of the  siblings showed symptoms of the condition. Identification of those symptoms is  already included in the training of doctors and midwives.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  has already signalled his positive intentions with regard to improving the  management of FASD. He has entered into discussions with the drinks industry  about the sale of alcohol at discount prices, which has helped to create the  problem of expectant mothers drinking at home. We should welcome his proactive  and sympathetic response.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>:  As other Members said, foetal alcohol spectrum disorder is the term that is  used to describe a range of totally avoidable mental and physical birth defects  that are the result of maternal alcohol exposure during pregnancy. They are  conditions for life that can have an adverse impact on the lives of the  individuals concerned and their carers. The disorders can have serious  consequences for infants and children, such as learning difficulties, attention  disorders, physical abnormalities and physical difficulties.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The advice for women who are trying to conceive and for  those who are pregnant has recently become clearer and more consistent across  Ireland and the United Kingdom. The message for women is now to avoid alcohol  completely. Indeed, for years, the message was mixed. We know that the message  about drinking a little &mdash; a small glass of wine, perhaps &mdash; was very subjective.  Unfortunately, many women did not know how much was too much, and that resulted  in many babies being born with FASD. The National Institute for Health and  Clinical Excellence guidelines are unambiguous: women should not drink at all  during pregnancy, and particularly not during the first three months, which is  the time when most of the baby&rsquo;s organs are being formed. It is at that stage  that the unborn child is most sensitive to the drugs and alcohol that can cause  birth defects.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Given our binge-drinking culture, it is important that the  message not to drink is presented clearly to all women. There is a real risk  that women could deliver babies with FASD if they keep up their usual drinking  habits during pregnancy. Even low levels of alcohol can affect a child&rsquo;s  development and can damage a child&rsquo;s nervous system. Education and  communication are vital if we are to reduce the number of women drinking while  trying to have a baby or when pregnant.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is also important to stress to women that if they have  been drinking alcohol before their pregnancy has been confirmed, they must  stop. Indeed, the area of health professionalism that diagnoses, manages, and  reduces the incidence of those disorders needs to be built upon. Although the  numbers affected are relatively low, there is a possibility that cases are  going undiagnosed, due to the wide range of symptoms, and there is also a  chance that some of the symptoms could be indicative of another disorder.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There must be a raising of the awareness and training of  paediatricians, midwives and other health professionals, such as social  workers, who may come across this type of disorder in children. Support must be  given to women who have a problem with alcohol and who find it difficult to  stop drinking when pregnant. As with all excessive alcohol use, it is important  to address it before becoming pregnant. We should consider providing education  in schools on alcohol abuse during pregnancy, because so many young women are  becoming pregnant.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The health and well-being of babies is a very serious  issue. Women want the best for their unborn children, and abstaining from  alcohol is essential in preventing the unnecessary adverse effects of the  disorder. We do not want to have to pick up the pieces when the damage is done.  The important thing is prevention.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I welcome the motion and thank George Robinson for bringing it to the House.  The effects of this very serious disorder can and should be avoided. It is  essential that every effort continues to impress upon young women the  consequences to their new-born babies if they continue to abuse alcohol while  pregnant.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As has been said, the effects of excessive drinking during  pregnancy can be horrendous. I know of a case, which is probably typical, of a  mother who, unfortunately, had succumbed to the evils of alcohol and was  recognised as an alcoholic in her community. Both she and her partner were  long-term unemployed. The baby was born with severe learning difficulties. That  family had little knowledge of foetal alcohol spectrum disorder and had little  understanding of how to access services for the new-born baby and the rest of  the family. It goes without saying that that new-born baby got off to a very  poor start in life.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A recent study showed that some 55% of women consumed  alcohol during pregnancy, against the advice of professionals, who continually  advise that no alcohol should be taken during that time. It is widely  recognised that heavy alcohol consumption during pregnancy leads to growth  retardation, abnormality of the features, intellectual impairment, memory  deficits and other defects. Surely, no mother would wish to ignore all the  medical advice on the subject when she knows exactly what the outcome of her  actions will be.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I know of the excellent work of the Health Promotion  Agency, the Health Department and other organisations, and I hope that they  will continue to appeal to women who are pregnant or who plan to have a family  to avoid excessive alcohol consumption at all costs, explaining time and time  again what the results may be.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion requests that the Minister introduce dedicated  teams to assist families affected by FASD, and that must be of high priority.  However, the main emphasis must be on prevention, and I concur with Carmel  Hanna&rsquo;s closing remarks on that issue. That is the main message that must be  put across. I support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  I congratulate my colleague for securing this important debate. Foetal alcohol  spectrum disorder has been described by the Salvation Army as:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the most common and preventable cause of birth  defects and brain damage in children.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It has been reported that almost one million children in  the United Kingdom live with a parent who has an alcohol dependency. A survey  published this morning by Tommy&rsquo;s the baby charity states that one third of  pregnant mothers drink alcohol during their pregnancy. Given that 70% of women  in Northern Ireland drink alcohol, and that there has been a recent increase in  binge drinking among younger females, there is a danger that, without education  and information, pregnant young women will be unaware of the dangers of  drinking alcohol and will place their unborn child &mdash; or children &mdash; at risk of  FASD.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Some 6,000 children a year are born in the United Kingdom  with FASD. FASD is not a diagnosis, but it describes a full spectrum of  disabilities &mdash; from birth anomalies, such as low birth weight, to neurological  problems that have the potential to leave lasting physiological and  psychological damage. FASD has the potential to create lasting physical,  cognitive and behavioural problems. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s speaking to the  manufacturers of alcoholic drinks about the issue, because they, along with  publicans and the Government &mdash; who do very well from the tax on alcohol &mdash; have  an important role. I hope that a holistic approach is adopted to deal with the  problem.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In small children, FASD leads to irregular sleep patterns;  a failure to thrive through a height and weight deficiency; an inability to  make and keep friends; a lack of the normal ability to distinguish friends from  enemies; difficult-to-manage public behaviour; danger to the affected children,  and to others, because they do not grasp the universal laws of cause and  effect; deficiency in the normal sequential learning abilities of reasoning,  judgement and memory; highly manipulative behaviour; and, sometimes, medical  fragility. Such problems in development are likely to be amplified as a child  grows older.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Research shows that if FASD is not diagnosed correctly,  children and adolescents are likely to experience mental-health problems; drop  out of school early; experience homelessness; engage in inappropriate sexual  behaviour; develop alcohol and drug problems; have regular employment problems;  and be unable to handle independent living. Some children may not experience  such obvious forms of abuse and disadvantage, but they are likely to suffer  from neglect or a chronic lack of the little things that are crucial to their  overall well-being. Where affected children live with parents who continue to  experience difficulties with alcohol, they can be exposed daily to rage,  violence and abuse, which become part of the unpredictable and inconsistent  environment in which they live.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The lack of a diagnosis of FASD often means the adoption of  inappropriate and ineffective traditional interventions that can lead to the  development of secondary disabilities. A child who receives a correct diagnosis  is in a much better position to benefit from intervention than one who is not  diagnosed, or one who is misdiagnosed and receives only partial treatment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I call on the Minister to use the resources available to  him to provide better education for young mothers. Young women must be better  informed of the evident risks of drinking alcohol during pregnancy. Guidelines  published by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence  recommend that women not drink alcohol during the first three months of  pregnancy &mdash; my personal view is that they should not drink at all. We must do  everything possible to further protect unborn children from such unnecessary  abuse. FASD is preventable. I support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  Members are aware that we live in a society that abuses alcohol at a level that  impacts seriously and detrimentally on every aspect of the lives of individual  citizens and on wider society.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Tens of thousands of households in Northern Ireland spend  more money each week on alcohol than on food. Even during the current credit  crisis, some alcoholic beverages are cheaper to buy than bottled water and soft  drinks. Daily, newspapers are filled with reports of alcohol-related violence,  mayhem and murder. Children as young as 10 years of age are admitted to  hospital with alcohol poisoning. The binge-drinking mentality has become  pervasive in society. Fifty per cent of weekend admissions to accident and  emergency departments involve alcohol abuse. Youth is being corrupted by the  availability of cheap, potent, alcoholic drinks. In many parts of the Province,  the situation at weekends and holiday periods seems to be out of control and  well beyond the police&rsquo;s ability to deal with effectively. A sad feature of the  problem is that an increasing number of valuable and scarce resources are  expended on dealing with incidents and illnesses that result from alcohol  abuse.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">With the debate, the Assembly has turned its collective  attention towards the need for the introduction and development of policies to  tackle the increasing incidence of children being born with foetal alcohol  spectrum disorder. It is the single biggest cause of non-genetic mental  handicap in the Western World, yet the condition is 100% preventable. In young  children, it causes serious growth deficiencies, major neurological damage to  the brain and the central nervous system. The condition is caused when  expectant mothers consume large amounts of alcohol during their pregnancy. One  episode of binge drinking during pregnancy is one too many.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The National Organisation on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome-UK  estimates that more than 6,000 children are born with FASD each year in the  whole of the UK. Excessive alcohol can damage unborn babies at all stages of  pregnancy. As mothers can often be unaware that they are pregnant for some  weeks or months, those who wish to conceive and bear children should adopt a  zero-tolerance attitude to alcohol. There are no safe limits.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly cannot ignore a tragedy of that dimension; it  must take decisive and determined action. Children who are damaged by alcohol  in the womb suffer throughout their lives from behavioural and learning  difficulties, poor memory skills and attention problems. Often, they have  noticeable physical deformities and are at greater risk of sudden infant death.  The Assembly must acknowledge the part that is already played by primary- and  community-care workers to develop selective prevention strategies that include  screening and referral procedures to identify and target women who are most at  risk and to minimise the risk to their unborn children. However, no child  should be born to suffer in that way. Prevention has always been better than  cure.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I support the call on the Health Minister to introduce  well-researched and well-resourced multi-agency policies that involve various  Departments in order to tackle the increase in FASD. Special emphasis must be  put on assisting families who are affected by FASD. However, on a wider front,  there is a pressing need for the Assembly to tackle, as a priority, the scourge  of alcohol abuse in society. People must change their attitude to the dangers  of alcohol. Alcohol abuse must be given the urgent and critical attention that  it deserves.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I add my thanks and congratulations to Mr Robinson for securing this important  debate. I also want to pass on the apologies of my party colleague Mr John  McCallister, who, unfortunately, cannot be present. Mr McCallister and his  staff have worked for considerable time on the issue, which he has raised in  the Health Committee. He has worked with NOFAS-UK to raise awareness of the  condition in Northern Ireland. He is the sponsor of a training day that will be  held in Stormont on 14 October 2008. It has been organised by NOFAS-UK and is  an opportunity to highlight this avoidable condition among relevant bodies. I  hope that Members will support that event.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Foetal alcohol spectrum disorder is an umbrella term that  describes the range of disabilities that are caused entirely by a woman&rsquo;s  drinking alcohol at any time during her pregnancy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Disabilities can often occur even before she knows that she  is pregnant. Foetal alcohol spectrum disorder symptoms include the baby&rsquo;s  having a small head and body, facial abnormalities and brain damage. Symptoms  that are not visible may include behavioural and attention-deficit disorders.  Organ dysfunction, epilepsy and learning difficulties &mdash; in addition to other  conditions &mdash; can all derive from the mother&rsquo;s consumption of alcohol during  pregnancy. All those conditions are permanent and irreversible but, as has been  said in the debate, totally avoidable.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Drinking alcohol during pregnancy is a serious problem that  affects the most innocent and vulnerable even before they are born. The  decision that expectant mothers take can destroy the rest of their children&rsquo;s  lives. We need a two-pronged approach to tackle the issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">First, we must take steps to reduce the number of women  drinking alcohol while pregnant. Unfortunately, there is an increase in the  numbers of teenage girls who engage in sexual activity but continue to drink.  However, that group does not account for all the cases of this avoidable  disorder. Last year, the British Medical Association (BMA) published a paper on  the syndrome as a guide to healthcare professionals. The document includes a  number of recommendations that we should consider. The BMA recommends that, as  part of routine clinical care, all healthcare professionals should provide  ongoing advice and support to expectant mothers at every stage of pregnancy.  That should include information on the risks of maternal alcohol consumption.  All health promotion and advice should be supplemented with take-home printed  information on the risks of consuming alcohol during pregnancy. During  antenatal care, alcohol use should be monitored and recorded appropriately. Any  pregnant woman who has a known history of alcohol consumption should be offered  brief intervention counselling. Any expectant mother who is identified as being  a high-risk case should be referred to specialist alcohol services for  appropriate treatment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I recognise that training is in place in the Health Service  in Northern Ireland. The steps outlined may not be entirely appropriate, but  most reasonable people will agree that more steps should be taken to educate  and support pregnant women and to help them not to drink alcohol. I am aware of  the UK Chief Medical Officer&rsquo;s position on the issue, and he has issued advice.  An agreement between the Government and the drinks industry has ensured that  alcohol units and health information will be included on labels. However, more  can be done to prevent drinking during pregnancy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, we must consider how to deal with the conditions  that result from mothers drinking during pregnancy. That has already been  partly touched on in the discussion on misdiagnosis. I agree with Mrs Hanna  that the key to dealing with the disorder is prevention. However, that must not  detract from the need to care for those children and families whom the disorder  already affects. Its effects on them are devastating. One has to live through  it to see how it affects them. We cannot ignore those people. Serious measures  must be put in place to deal with the condition, and to support the families  and children affected.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  A&rsquo;hm fer the motion. A houl at a wean bes a gift fae God. An ivry wean bes a  wee miracle. A houl forebye at thair bes an onus oan iz tae leuk aboot the  weans an&rsquo; the mither tae the bes&rsquo; o&rsquo; oor ability tae dae sae an&rsquo; thon&rsquo;s fer wie  A congratulate mae colleague fer bringin the matther tae public attention.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion. A baby is a gift from God, and each  and every child is a little miracle. Furthermore, there is an onus on us to  protect babies and mothers to the best of our ability. It is for that reason  that I congratulate my colleague on bringing the matter to public attention. I  was shocked when I read the reports of the damage done to babies when their  mothers drink alcohol during pregnancy. It is not necessary to repeat what my  colleagues have said already on that subject. However, it is important that,  although the number of births affected in the Province is some 10 a year, the  number of people affected by the symptoms is much greater.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Symptoms can range from learning difficulties and ADHD to  facial abnormalities. Given the number of children in the Province who suffer  from behavioural issues, flags are definitely being raised.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will not go over everything that we have already heard.  However, midwives say that the mothers who admit to drinking while pregnant  often fib about the amount that they actually consume. That is where the  problem lies. Mothers and fathers are unaware of the severe nature of the  problem and feel that a fib is enough to cover themselves, or perhaps they do  not see the danger in it. They do not understand the issue, and it is little  wonder.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When my colleague asked the Minister how widespread  information was on the issue, the answer was that it was not very widespread.  Some midwives are trained in dealing with those issues, some are not. No  leaflets are given out, and no posters are posted. Although legislation concerning  labelling on products is changing, the Minister said that the Department will  voluntarily put information on the labels at some stage. However, it will take  more than that. I ask the Minister to label alcohol in the same way as  cigarette packets, which carry the easy-to-understand warning, &ldquo;Smoking kills&rdquo;  in big, black letters.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the United States, wording on alcohol labels advises  pregnant women, or those trying to get pregnant, against drinking any alcohol.  Like my colleague Iris Robinson, I want to see that approach employed here. It  is all well and good to tell pregnant women to limit their drinking, but to do  so allows certain people to think that they can drink just a little bit more  without doing any harm. The fact is this: it can and does make a difference to  the life of child. I urge the Minister to make the right, and clear, statement  about that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The last survey on this issue that was carried out by the  Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety found that 6,000  children a year are born with FASD and that some 9% of pregnant women are still  drinking more than is recommended. Those statistics are based on the women who  are not telling fibs, so who knows what the real figures are. More than 50% of  women admit to drinking during pregnancy. I am sure that the Department wants  to lessen that number. The answer should be to tell women that no alcohol  should be consumed during pregnancy &mdash; full stop.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">All pregnancy-related appointments with GPs, midwives and  in hospital must be supplemented with take-home information highlighting the  risks of drinking while pregnant and advising a no-alcohol policy. That is also  the recommendation of those involved in highlighting the disorder. If a child  is born with problems, his or her mother always wonders what she could have  done differently. Some of those problems may be preventable, because the  disorder is completely preventable, so let us help to prevent it today.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There must be wide understanding of the difficulties  associated with alcohol. Mothers must understand that their children&rsquo;s bodies  do not have the ability to process alcohol in the way that their bodies do.  Alcohol immediately affects a child in the womb. Some ideas have been proposed,  and a complete ban on alcohol during pregnancy has been advocated. Can we, in  good conscience, do any less? The health and social life of a mother is not  adversely affected by not drinking, whereas the life of a child can be affected  through his or her mother&rsquo;s drinking, so let us make clear &mdash; through widespread  labelling of alcohol &mdash; that mothers-to-be must not drink. Let us have posters  on the walls of health centres, leaflets distributed at anti-natal classes, and  a publicised campaign to let prospective parents realise the dangers &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way. Does he agree that education in schools is  one of the most important ways in which to highlight the dangers of drinking  while pregnant? Does he also agree the Department of Education should adopt the  role of providing such information?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I thank the Member for her intervention and for her comments.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That is certainly one of the issues that we must address.  There is a role not only for the Minister of Health, but for the Minister of  Education also.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I fully support the motion, and I ask that Members do the  same. We must protect the family unit and the health of unborn children in the  Province.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: Alcohol misuse is  a major public-health issue in Northern Ireland. The Department estimates that  the total cost of alcohol misuse is more than &pound;700 million a year and that the  cost to the Health Service of treating addiction alone is some &pound;12 million a  year. A wide range of physical and mental harm is associated with the misuse of  alcohol, including sclerosis of the liver, several cancers, increased blood  pressure, stroke and heart disease. It is also associated with harm to the  community in the form of antisocial behaviour. It is linked with accidents in  and outside the home; and we are becoming increasingly aware of alcohol&rsquo;s  association with suicide.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Alcohol is clearly an issue that we need to address.  Today&rsquo;s motion concerns one impact of alcohol misuse &mdash; the effect that it has  on the unborn child.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The term &ldquo;foetal alcohol spectrum disorder&rdquo; is used to  describe the many problems that are associated with exposure to alcohol before  birth. The most severe of these disorders is foetal alcohol syndrome, a  combination of physical and mental birth defects. These defects occur when  babies are exposed to maternal drinking during pregnancy. Only a minority of  pregnant women with alcohol problems have babies with the more severe foetal  alcohol syndrome. The severity appears to relate to the frequency of high doses  of alcohol during pregnancy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">One of the difficulties of FASD is that it is sometimes a  hidden issue. Diagnosis is complex and open to interpretation. It is,  therefore, difficult to state confidently the prevalence of the condition in  Northern Ireland. Based on international estimates, it is likely that between  seven and 10 births a year here could be described as exhibiting foetal alcohol  syndrome.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The latest figures available show that, over the past six  years, there have been 20 hospital admissions involving 11 patients requiring  treatment because of foetal alcohol syndrome. It is likely that more people did  not have the condition diagnosed or did not require hospital care. It is also  important to note that the condition does not affect the individual only as a  baby or as a child; it is a lifelong condition. Although the number of recorded  cases in Northern Ireland is small, each case concerns a unique individual who  has real needs that must be met.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The first part of the motion states that we should reduce  the level of foetal alcohol spectrum disorder. That means that we should  address the entire issue of alcohol and the full range of problems that its  misuse causes in our society. Although the focus for this debate is FASD, I am  sure that Members will agree that alcohol misuse causes other significant  health and social problems. As I have stated previously, excessive use of  alcohol can increase the risk of liver damage, heart disease and cancer,  including breast cancer. The emotional and mental health consequences of  alcohol misuse are also considerable.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Alcohol is involved in one third of all suicides and too  often is a factor in antisocial behaviour and violence. Domestic violence is  often fuelled by alcohol, and, shockingly, one third of all domestic violence  incidents occur when a woman is pregnant. Tragically, alcohol is too often the  common link for physical, emotional and mental-health problems.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In Northern Ireland, the main problem with alcohol is our  unhealthy attitude towards its use. That attitude is deeply embedded in our  culture and is difficult to change. I am determined to continue the work in  addressing the issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In May 2006, the Department launched its &lsquo;New Strategic  Direction for Alcohol and Drugs 2006-11&rsquo;. The aim of the strategy is to reduce  the amount of alcohol- and drug-related harm in Northern Ireland. There is a  clear focus on the need to reduce the level of excessive binge drinking and  increase public awareness of the real harms associated with alcohol misuse.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The strategy is supported by a range of Departments,  including those of Education, Social Development, Culture, Arts and Leisure,  and Employment and Learning. It contains regional and local outcomes that  depend on cross-sectoral co-operation in order to achieve them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am encouraged by the wide support for our efforts to  combat alcohol misuse. I have had discussions with each of the major  supermarkets, representatives from the alcohol and drinks industry, and the  PSNI on the availability of alcohol, especially to our children and young  people.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The debate also presents an opportunity to highlight our  growing concern about the level and pattern of female drinking in Northern  Ireland, where 67% of women choose to drink. Of those, one third are binge  drinkers; in the 18 to 20 age range, 50% of drinkers binge drink.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The occurrence of foetal alcohol syndrome is associated  with the frequency of binge drinking. Over the past 20 years, Northern Ireland,  in common with the rest of the UK and other countries, has seen a rise in the  proportion of women &mdash; especially young women &mdash; who drink, and hidden within  that increase is a growing trend towards excessive drinking.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">All our campaigns, literature and websites ensure that the  risks to women from alcohol misuse are made clear. That will be further  strengthened by a specific leaflet &mdash; which I have instructed the Health  Promotion Agency to publish &mdash; in support of the next phase of the  binge-drinking campaign. Education work is ongoing in schools and youth clubs  across Northern Ireland, and we will continue to support such work.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We have a clear message for women about the effects of  alcohol consumption during pregnancy and its relation to foetal alcohol  spectrum disorder. The current advice, which is common across the UK, is that  alcohol can damage an unborn baby, so women who are pregnant should avoid  alcohol or at least cut down to a couple of drinks a week. Couples who are  trying to get pregnant should also cut down as alcohol can affect both the egg  and the cells that produce the sperm. Many of us feel that that message could  be toughened up.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Excessive alcohol consumption can not only harm an unborn  child but it may result in couples having difficulty conceiving. That advice  will be found in all our literature on alcohol. It will also be found in the  recently revised copy of &lsquo;The Pregnancy Book&rsquo;, which is available to first-time  expectant mothers through antenatal clinics, GPs or health visitors. I assure  Members that the real risks of alcohol to the unborn child are made clear to  expectant mothers by health and social care professionals.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Just as we have seen improvements in the screening of  pregnant women when cases of domestic violence are suspected, so too there are  clear procedures in place when it is thought that a particular risk has been  identified in relation to alcohol misuse. That involves liaison between health  and social care colleagues to advise and monitor the health and well-being of  the expectant woman and the unborn child. Members should be reassured that this  issue is one that all health and social care professionals receive training on.  The &lsquo;Hidden Harm&rsquo; action plan, which my Department will issue later in the  autumn, places particular emphasis on inter-agency collaboration and training  in addressing the needs of those young people who are problem alcohol and drug  users and who are being cared for by parents or carers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That leads me on to the other point of the motion &mdash; the  introduction of dedicated teams to assist families affected by foetal alcohol  spectrum disorder. I fully understand and appreciate the issues and challenges  for those families, however, the consistent view of health and social care  professionals who work in that area is that dedicated services are not always  appropriate and, in fact, may not be beneficial. That is because children with  the disorder require access to a wide and often different range of services.  The complex nature and broad range of diagnosed conditions associated with FASD  means that the management of individuals diagnosed as having that disorder  should be tailored to their individual needs, circumstances, the severity of  their condition and their responsiveness to interventions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For example, the specific needs of children who have  suffered a learning disability as a result of the disorder are met through a  range of services funded by my Department. Those services are provided for all  children with a learning disability and will vary to meet the specific needs of  the individual child. Services for children include allied health professional  provision such as occupational therapy, physiotherapy, speech and language  therapy, respite provision and day-care provision.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Respite care is an important part of the wide range of  health and social care services provided. Such care takes many different forms  and is delivered in care settings that range from people&rsquo;s homes to day  facilities or residential care homes. I have secured extra funding for respite  care amounting to a total of 400 additional packages, which will be available  to those people diagnosed as having FASD. I have secured &pound;4 million to provide  a total of nine early-intervention support teams across the five health trusts.  Those teams, which operate in early-years settings, comprise speech and  language therapists, community and paediatric nurses, paediatricians,  occupational therapists and physiotherapists. These multidisciplinary teams  focus on diagnosis, assessment and early intervention.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Improving and safeguarding the well-being of all children  and young people in Northern Ireland are primary aims of Government policy.  Improving the assessment process is essential, which is why my Department has  developed a new assessment framework for understanding the needs of children in  Northern Ireland (UNOCINI). The framework is in the process of being introduced  in all health and social care trusts.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I mentioned my meetings with the alcohol and drinks  industry. An agreement was reached with the industry to introduce health  information on drinks labels, including information about alcohol and  pregnancy. That was a voluntary arrangement. However, consultation is taking  place in order to see whether health messages on such labels should be made  mandatory. I am determined to pursue as a matter of urgency, at all levels, the  clear labelling of alcoholic drinks with health messages, including responsible  drinking in pregnancy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The drinks industry has a clear, corporate, social  responsibility in respect of the products that it manufactures, sells and  markets. That is just one element of the new strategic direction for alcohol  and drugs which is aimed at tackling alcohol misuse across Northern Ireland. As  part of the strategy, there will be further phases of the binge drinking public  information campaign next year, and the young people and alcohol action plan  will be published later this year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am, and will be, taking measures in order to prevent or  reduce the level of foetal alcohol spectrum disorder by targeting the level of  alcohol consumption in Northern Ireland, obviously including among women. There  are a range of services for children with special needs, including FASD.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that individuals can be treated based on  their unique individual needs and circumstances. However, we do not necessarily  have a total picture of the scale of FASD in Northern Ireland, and that is an  issue that I am discussing with my departmental officials in order to get a  more complete picture, which would enable better planning of services.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the meantime, we will all take responsibility for  helping to reduce the levels of alcohol misuse in society. Tackling drinking  habits that are almost culturally ingrained is a major challenge. My Department  will continue to target the level and pattern of drinking by young women, and  continue to address the issue of alcohol and pregnancy, and to provide  information and appropriate advice. To those women who drink excessively during  pregnancy, the message is simple: alcohol and pregnancy do not mix. The stark  fact is that every case of foetal alcohol spectrum disorder is preventable, and  I will ensure that all efforts are made in order to achieve that.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  I support this motion in the name of my colleague Mr George Robinson. It is not  a motion to judge, but to produce a positive debate on the way forward for  those suffering from and affected by FASD.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Alcohol misuse and problem drinking can severely affect the  well-being of families through its association with child abuse and neglect,  domestic violence and sudden infant deaths. I was shocked to learn that there  are no accurate figures available for the number of people in families with  FASD. That, surely, must be the basic starting point for the Minister in order  to begin to resolve the problem.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">How can this Assembly improve the situation of those  affected by FASD, whether individuals or families, when there is no accurate  database from which to work? In order to establish such a database, we must,  first, have accurate diagnosis of cases of FASD. That is the foundation stone  for everything that this motion seeks to achieve.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My colleague George Robinson listed some of the  characteristics associated with FASD, and I will not repeat them. However,  Members must recognise that FASD is entirely preventable and we must remain  focused on establishing the services that we seek to provide. A concentrated  and targeted approach is required, not only to assist those families who are  living with FASD, but to reduce the number of future cases.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It makes no sense, morally or economically, not to tackle  the problem head-on. The prevention of the adverse impact of alcohol  consumption during pregnancy remains a significant challenge, not least because  of the poor levels of awareness and under&shy;standing of FASD among healthcare  professionals and the public.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Health promotion and educational programmes have been shown  to be ineffective in altering drinking behaviour, and therefore FASD must be  considered as part of a wider strategy to reduce the harm caused by alcohol.  Primary and community care settings provide the ideal opportunity to deliver  active prevention strategies, including screening for maternal alcohol  consumption. It is essential that young people are given the starkest possible  message about the effects that alcohol or drugs can have on them years ahead  when they wish to start a family.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Not every child who is born with FASD will need a great  amount of care and support, but it must be available to those who do. Every  child in Northern Ireland should have the opportunity to develop his or her  skills and abilities to their full potential. For some, that means that a care  package must be easily accessible, and the Assembly must ensure that that is  exactly what is provided.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Today&rsquo;s debate highlights the need for packages of  specialist services to be available to those affected by FASD, whether for  individuals, families, or a combination of the two. The need for young people  to be aware of the dangers to the next generation from alcohol consumption is  abundantly clear. The only effective way to achieve such awareness is through  co-operation between Departments and specialist outside bodies. Some people  might think that the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety is  unfortunate in having to take the lead departmental role. However, the crucial  issue is the achievement of accurate diagnostics of FASD, and the services and  benefits that other Departments will subsequently provide depend on that. Only  an inter-agency approach can provide the support that the families concerned  need. I repeat that the achievement of accurate diagnostics is the foundation  stone of what the motion aims to achieve.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I recently read an article that appeared in &lsquo;The Irish  News&rsquo; on 25 May 2006:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Excessive alcohol consumption in pregnant women has  led to 50 babies being born with serious mental and physical birth defects in  the last five years &hellip; A consultant with Belfast City Hospital has warned that  the amount of babies with Foetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) is likely to be much  higher, as many are not diagnosed until pre-school age. FAS causes disfiguring  facial abnormalities, small body weight, mental development delays and other  behavioural problems. Many children born with this syndrome require lifelong  care.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Today, I urge the Minister to ensure that the  services required by FASD-affected families and individuals will be available  as soon as possible. If the Assembly lays the proper foundation stone, all that  is built on top of it will provide the safety and security that is so  desperately required. I apologise for not being present when George Robinson  started today&rsquo;s debate; I was chairing an all-party Assembly group meeting on  cancer. However, as I listened to the rest of the debate, three or four key  issues emerged: awareness, prevention, education, and support. That really sums  up the content of the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Gardiner spoke of the hidden cost to the Department of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety on account of those who consume too  much alcohol. The Minister&rsquo;s comments about the amount of money that is spent  on treating alcoholics and those who misuse alcohol illustrate the fact that a  staggering amount of money comes out of the Department&rsquo;s budget to tackle the  misuse of alcohol. That issue must be urgently tackled head on.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Carmel Hanna said that people must be made aware of the  problem, and she mentioned the awareness campaign. The clear message must go  out that, as the Minister said, alcohol and pregnancy do not mix. It would be  wrong to send out a message that it is OK to have a few drinks a week. There  must be no ambiguity on the matter; we must be clear and concise in saying that  alcohol and pregnancy do not mix. No alcohol should be consumed during  pregnancy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Kieran McCarthy spoke about the horrendous effects that the  syndrome can have on children after they are born, such as lack of growth, and  other disabilities. My colleague Iris Robinson spoke about the educational  needs of young mothers and the need for early intervention, which is essential  for children who, through no fault of their own, may be affected by the  condition. It is vital that the correct procedures be put in place to ensure  early intervention.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Alex Easton spoke about the need for prevention, and the  misuse of alcohol among young women. That issue must be tackled. Tom Elliott  spoke about the measures that must be taken on prevention, and he said that  those who are already suffering as a result of the disease must not be  forgotten. Along with a focus on prevention, that point must be taken on board  so that measures are also in place to help people who are already afflicted.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Jim Shannon said that life is precious, and we must  remember that life is a gift from God. Therefore, it is important that the  proper facilities are in place to treat anyone who is affected by such a  terrible disease.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I commend the Minister on the strategies that are already  in place, and on the action plans that he proposes to put in place. I hope that  the necessary measures will be introduced, and I support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly calls on the Minister of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety to introduce policies to reduce the level of Foetal  Alcohol Spectrum Disorder; where necessary co-operating with other agencies and  Departments; and to introduce dedicated teams to assist families affected by  Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Adjourned at 4.59 pm.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic"><span class="B3BodyText">&lt; <a href="080916.htm">previous</a> / <a href="080923.htm">next &gt;</a></span></p></td>
