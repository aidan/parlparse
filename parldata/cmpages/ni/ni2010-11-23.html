      <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="1"></a>Ministerial Statements</p>
      <p class="H4StageHeading">PPS 4: Economic Development/ PPS 16: Tourism</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have received notice from the Minister of the Environment that he wishes to  make a statement to the House.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment (Mr Poots)</strong>: With your permission, Mr Speaker, I wish to  make a statement to the effect that I am now issuing Planning Policy Statement  (PPS) 4 on economic development and bringing it into effect. That document  replaces the existing PPS 4 and supersedes policies for employment in &lsquo;A  Planning Strategy for Rural Northern Ireland.&rsquo; Today, I am also issuing Draft  Planning Policy Statement 16 on tourism for four months&rsquo; public consultation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A thriving and expanding business community is critically  important to our future prosperity and well-being. PPS 4 will help businesses  in this tough economic climate to locate in the best places across Northern Ireland.  Draft PPS 16 is a response to the challenges and opportunities of future  tourism growth. Each PPS is important in its own right, and both have crucial  roles to play in supporting economic growth.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">PPS 4 concerns the development associated with industry,  business, storage and distribution. It puts in place a modern and robust policy  framework for the sustainable management of such development and shows how  economic growth can be accommodated in development plans. It also gives  flexibility and certainty over planning for economic development.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Various industries and business sectors have particular  requirements for their location and surroundings. PPS 4, therefore, sets out  different criteria for different types of development. Its policies also  recognise that cities, towns and villages differ in the scale of business and  industrial development that they can reasonably accommodate. PPS 4 provides for  office development to be focused in city and town centres, where it can benefit  from the concentration of people and goods, public transport and other  infrastructure. In those locations, office-based businesses also benefit from  their proximity to business, professional, technical and financial services.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Communications and software design are closely related to  high technology, knowledge-driven industries. PPS 4 recognises that there are  usually economic benefits to grouping those industries in business parks. To  protect existing businesses, PPS 4 prevents incompatible uses in their  vicinity. For example, some sectors, such as life sciences and food processing,  need a contaminant-free environment. In the case of such businesses, risk of  contamination can be taken into account when considering new applications in  their vicinity. Some businesses may require some degree of physical separation from  neighbouring built-up areas because of noise or smell. PPS 4 takes account of  that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to strike a balance between the need to  protect the countryside from unnecessary development and the need to support  rural communities. PPS 4 sets out the circumstances in which permission will be  granted for economic development in the open countryside. It allows for the  redevelopment and expansion of existing employment sites in the rural area,  including for tourism. PPS 4 allows for small-scale economic development on  suitable sites on the periphery of existing settlements where there are no  alternatives in the settlement. PPS 4 encourages such industrial and business  uses to cluster on one site in any particular area.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Good design is as important for economic development as it  is for other forms of development. Design is not just about appearance; it is  about how a development relates to its surroundings. For that reason, PPS 4  includes general design criteria to ensure that adverse impacts are minimised.  In all cases, development will have to accord with Secured by Design principles  to ensure that the design of a development helps to deter crime and promote  personal safety.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Economic development means investment, which generally  means more building and a demand for land. We need a generous and continuous  supply of land, which is what the regional development strategy requires.  Identifying land for employment purposes is a matter for development plans, and  PPS 4 provides guidance on estimating how much land is needed and where.  Development plans can identify locations and specify a variety of economic uses  to cater for future needs. Such variety and choice will maximise the  opportunity for local and inward investors.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We need to protect land that is already zoned for  employment for the future and to make sure that it is not lost to uses such as  housing. To that end, PPS 4 protects zoned land and indicates where alternative  uses may be permitted, including mixed-use regeneration schemes, especially  where buildings of architectural or historical interest will be secured. In  particular, PPS 4 allows for schemes such as the Titanic Quarter.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The publication of PPS 4 brings planning policy for  economic development up to date by providing policy for offices,  knowledge-based industries and storage and distribution. PPS 4 ensures that the  right types of development are directed to the right location.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will now turn to draft PPS 16 on tourism. In the draft  tourism strategy for Northern Ireland 2020, which she published in February,  the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment set out a new vision,  strategic direction and targets for tourism. The targets for achievement by  2020 are to increase visitor numbers from 3&middot;5 million to 4&middot;5 million and to double  earnings from tourism to &pound;1 billion. Those targets reflect the potential for  further growth in the tourism industry in Northern Ireland and underline the  potential of tourism as a key economic driver.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Increased tourism activity and investment of that scale  will inevitably generate pressure for new development, such as tourist  accommodation, facilities, attractions and supporting infrastructure. Draft PPS  16 provides a clear and strong planning framework for managing tourism  development in ways that are sustainable. It strikes a careful and sensitive  balance between environmental concerns and the development of the tourism  industry in Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to value what the tourist values, and that  is reflected in draft PPS 16. Unmanaged and unsustainable development is not in  anyone&rsquo;s interest. If permitted, inappropriate development could prejudice the  longer-term interests of the tourism industry.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Northern Ireland  boasts many assets, such as the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway  and the Carrick-a-Rede rope bridge, which are valued and visited by those who  are fortunate enough to live here and by tourists from further afield. Those  assets are vital in providing a high quality and often unique visitor  experience. To maintain the integrity and tourism potential of tourism assets,  draft PPS 16 proposes policies to safeguard them from inappropriate and harmful  development</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Our cities, towns and villages have a great deal to offer  tourists. As well as transport links, accommodation, restaurants and shops, our  settlements boast places of historic or cultural interest, and they provide  entertainment and other attractions. Draft PPS 16 aims to exploit that by  focusing new tourism development in settlements. The synergies created between  new developments and existing businesses and attractions will enrich the  visitor experience and help to boost Northern Ireland&rsquo;s earnings from  tourism. However, the policies in draft PPS 16 also recognise that tourists  visit different areas for different reasons and to enjoy different experiences.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As not all forms of tourism development will be suited to  an urban location, draft PPS 16 facilitates some tourism development in the  countryside. It ensures that such development is sustainable within the broader  planning policy context of the regional development strategy and PPS 21, which  relates to sustainable development in the countryside. It also ensures that  random, inappropriate or excessive development in the countryside is avoided.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Draft PPS 16 provides for tourist amenities in the countryside  that are not suited to an urban or village location, such as angling centres.  Similarly, it allows for tourist amenity proposals that need to be located  close to existing tourist attractions in the countryside, such as a visitor  centre that is associated with a particular site of historic or archaeological  importance.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Draft PPS 16 also proposes the removal of the  much-criticised tourist needs test, which is applied to tourist accommodation  proposals in the countryside. Replacement of that test with specific criteria  that are tailored to different forms of tourism development will improve the  transparency of policy. It will also make it easier for developers to ensure  that their proposals accord with planning policy.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Draft PPS 16 sets out the circumstances in which hotels,  self-catering units and holiday parks are permitted in the countryside.  Generally, it encourages hotels to locate in settlements, but a hotel will be  allowed in the countryside if the proposal includes the redevelopment of an appropriate  existing building. A newbuild hotel will be permitted outside, but close to, a  village or small settlement if there are no development opportunities in the  settlement or in nearby villages. Clusters of three or more self-catering units  may be permitted if they are within the grounds of a hotel, are associated with  a significant visitor attraction or involve the restoration of a clachan or  close. In all those cases, the policy requires the units to be retained for  tourism use and not to be used for permanent residential accommodation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Draft PPS 16 also provides for minor extensions to existing  static holiday or caravan parks in the countryside and for new small-scale  touring sites. However, the scope for integrating a new static holiday park or  a large-scale extension to an existing facility into the rural landscape is  limited. Regional planning policy is not a suitable tool for the identification  of such sites, and, accordingly, draft PPS 16 requires proposals of that nature  to be directed to sites identified in a development plan.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Draft PPS 16 also includes general and design criteria that  are applicable to all forms of tourism development. Those criteria will be used  to assess all applications for tourism development to ensure that Northern Ireland  gets sustainable, safe and high quality tourism schemes.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Draft PPS 16 provides a planning policy framework that is  right for Northern Ireland.  It will contribute to the economic prosperity of Northern Ireland by safeguarding  our rich and diverse tourism assets and by ensuring that future tourism  development is sustainable and of high quality. We are at the start of the  public consultation period on PPS 16. Planning policy for tourism is an  important issue, and I encourage everyone with an interest in tourism to tell  the Department what they think.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Both draft PPS 16 and PPS 4 will help us to achieve the  modern vibrant economy that is the Executive&rsquo;s top priority. Now more than  ever, it is essential that we have the tools in place to meet the challenges of  economic recovery and a highly competitive global economy. My Executive  colleagues welcomed both PPS 4 and draft PPS 16. I now commend those planning  policy statements to the House.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">10.45 am</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for the Environment (Mr Boylan)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a  Cheann Comhairle. With your permission, Mr Speaker, I will ask questions both  as Committee Chairperson and as an MLA for Newry and Armagh.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">On behalf of the Committee, I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s  statement. One of the Committee&rsquo;s key concerns when we discussed the early  proposals of Planning Policy Statement 4 was that guidance could hinder rural  business regeneration that is fostered by European funding. What liaison has  there been with the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) to  ensure that that will not happen? Will the Minister also indicate whether the  policy will protect existing businesses or does he intend to introduce policy  to protect them?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee is disappointed that we did not have prior  sight of the PPS 16 proposals. A departmental official promised us that we  would see planning policy statements as they came forward. Will the Minister  indicate whether the policy will allow for chalet-type or small cottages to  promote angling in rural areas such as mine?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The Chair&shy;person raises a number of issues. First,  Planning Policy Statement 16 is a draft policy. We will go through an extensive  consultation exercise, a process in which the views of the Committee will be  given full consideration. We will be very interested to hear its views on the  issue.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We indicated that, although an emphasis will be placed on  creating tourism development opportunities in urban settings &mdash; cities, towns or  villages &mdash; there are areas in which that may not be possible. In my statement,  I mentioned that an angling centre, for example, would not be suited to an  urban setting. All those issues are open to interpretation, and we will seek to  clarify them during the consultation process on the draft policy. The policy  can accommodate industry that exists in the countryside and uses existing  buildings. We will look to accommodate such industry where possible. Industry  should be developed in the industrial areas that are identified in area plans.  PPS 16 will encourage that, but we recognise that there are opportunities for  diversification.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairperson asked about liaison with the Department of  Agriculture and Rural Development and about European funding. Previously,  planning permission was granted on the basis of whether the Planning Service  thought that there was an identifiable need. When the local action groups  (LAGs) now identify an economic need and that the project is sustainable, the  Planning Service will take that as advice and not seek to second-guess the  proposal. That is the basis on which planning approvals will be granted now.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement. He identified the centrality of tourism  to the Northern Ireland  economy. To follow on from the Committee Chairperson&rsquo;s question, will the  Minister indicate whether tourism development will be allowed anywhere in  settlements?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: There is a general presumption in favour of development  for tourism purposes in settlements, subject to proposals respecting the site  context, residential amenity issues and, indeed, the character of the  settlement. Development will also be assessed against the specific provisions  of a development plan. Tourism development opportunities may be restricted on  land that is zoned for alternative uses or that is subject to protective  designation or significant development constraints. However, in general, we  will be very supportive of tourism opportunities in settlements.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  I congratulate the Minister on his statement and welcome much of it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to PPS 4, it is essential that the Minister  speaks to the Regional Development Minister to ensure that the transport system  is integrated to encourage what he is doing. By that, I do not mean roads such  as the A5, A8 or A6. If I may, I will unashamedly talk about Belfast International   Airport. We always push Belfast International Airport,  which has the capacity and could be expanded so that we have more jobs and use  it better. However, there is very poor transport access to it.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Will the Member come to his question?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  Will the Minister discuss that with the Regional Development Minister to ensure  that we get proper and better integrated transport to all the areas that he is  planning?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I will be discussing the regional development strategy  with the Regional Development Minister this afternoon. That is a key document,  and it is very important to get it right. I have issues with that document that  I want to raise with him. As he just indicated, the Member will have issues to  raise with the Regional Development Minister in relation to that document. I  will certainly highlight to the Minister for Regional Development the issues  that the Member has raised today.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>: I  also welcome the statement. Although it does not mention the seaside, it does  refer to the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway and the  Carrick-a-Rede rope bridge. I am more than happy about that. Is the Minister  satisfied that PPS 16 will address the very serious issues in our seaside towns  and villages, which have been decimated by very bad and unbalanced planning  that has no sense of the needs of the indigenous communities?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The Member raises a different type of question about the  needs of local communities in towns that are used widely for tourism purposes.  I tend to agree that a heart within a town is needed if it is going to be  attractive to tourists. To have that heart in a town, there needs to be an  indigenous population that lives there the whole year round to create a sense  of being and a sense of belonging. That will not be dealt with by PPS 16; it  needs to be dealt with through the area plan process.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I trust that, as we approach the Planning Appeals  Commission hearing on the northern area plan, Members from that area will  ensure that the towns there will be enhanced in many ways and will be greatly  improved through the opportunities that exist in them and that good planning  procedures are put in place. As we hand that power over to local authorities in  due course, I have no doubt that local councillors will take up the battle and  ensure that those towns are protected.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement and welcome its contents, particularly  the part that sets out to protect the countryside from unnecessary development.  Hopefully, that includes the coast.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">PPS 4 protects zoned land. Will that be set in stone? I am  thinking of a planning application in my constituency for a 25-acre site that  is zoned for employment. The wish is for a mixed-use development on that site.  Will PPS 4 rule out any mixture of housing and small business units, etc?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: PPS 4 seeks to protect employment opportunities and  economic opportunities. Therefore, if an area is identified within an area plan  for those types of opportunities, PPS 4 will largely protect that area from  other types of development. However, we need to be flexible, and if there is a  compelling case, the issues that are raised will be taken into consideration.  By and large, the document will strengthen the case for industrial land to stay  as industrial land, as opposed to being used for residential purposes.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Givan</strong>: I,  too, welcome PPS 4 and draft PPS 16. I am aware of some applications that are  in the system that may benefit from PPS 4 coming into effect. Will the Minister  advise the House of how many planning applications there are across the  Province that may now benefit from PPS 4 coming into effect?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">When discussing PPS 16, the Minister highlighted that a  specific tourist need was required for hotel development. How will that draft  policy make it easier for hotel development to occur in urban settings?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: With regard to businesses that would benefit from draft  PPS 16, around 200 planning applications are associated with rural businesses.  I have absolutely no doubt that a considerable number will be approvable on the  basis of the document. I think that the document will, therefore, be largely  welcomed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is my intention in the very near future to bring out a  further planning policy statement on economic considerations. That will further  enhance and place further emphasis on the opportunities for economic  development. It is essential, in this time of recession, that we are doing that  and that we are looking to support and aid business in sustainable development.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The draft planning policy statement&rsquo;s emphasis on providing  new hotels in urban areas can significantly enhance the tourism potential of  settlements, be of greater tourism benefit and be more readily integrated into  the built environment. Previously, hotel operators may have been required to  demonstrate a specific tourist need for the area in question. Applications  often came in with a Tourist Board letter of support, but those were generic  letters and did not add particular value to the application. We will not  require such letters for us to give approval to a hotel in an urban settlement.  If the application meets and complies with the other standards that I outlined,  namely, integration, residential amenity and so forth, those hotels will  normally be approved.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  I, too, welcome the Minister&rsquo;s announcement on PPS 4 and draft PPS 16. With  regard to PPS 4, the Minister referred in his statement to small-scale  development on the edge of settlements. Will he ensure that any developer who  seeks to make use of that change of policy is forced to look at all other alternatives  before they come to the edge of a town? In addition, why does draft PPS 16 not  facilitate tourism development throughout the whole countryside?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Development on the periphery of a village will be  permitted only after the opportunities for development in the village or town  are identified and only if there is availability in the area.</p>
      <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Molloy] in the Chair)</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We need to facilitate tourism development throughout the  countryside in a way that is sustainable and that would not run counter to the  planning policy framework that we established in PPS 21 and, indeed, in the  regional development strategy. Therefore, projects that tend to be a bit random  in their appearance or inappropriate or excessive development could end up  damaging our landscape quality and rural character and, as a consequence,  diminish the key tourism asset in the countryside. In that way, failure to  value what the tourist values would impair the long-term viability of the  tourism industry in Northern    Ireland. The dispersal of tourism  development throughout the countryside could forfeit any sustainable and  economic benefits that could be derived from a concentration of tourism  development in settlements. That said, however, there will be opportunities in  the countryside that are sustainable. Therefore, they have to be given a fair  and balanced hearing, and I trust that that will happen as a result of this  document.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s announcement, particularly that on PPS 4, where he  reminds us that the incompatible use of planning permissions in vicinities, for  example, when food science companies are not able to locate in a vicinity due  to potential contaminants, will be particularly welcome.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Will he assure the people of Crumlin in particular  that an application such as that for Rose Energy will never again be possible  under the new guidelines that he is bringing forward today on PPS 4?</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">11.00 am</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: As the Member well knows, there is a judicial review in  relation to that application, which constrains us from getting into the detail  of it.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement. Will he highlight the significant  differences between the existing PPS 4 and the revised PPS 4 that he has  announced this morning, and, particularly, the impact that it could have on  businesses in the current economic climate?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The existing PPS 4 would not have been as kind to business  as the new PPS 4. The new PPS 4 will create opportunities for rural businesses  to progress. That would not have happened under the old PPS 4. It will protect  land that is zoned for business from residential development in a much stronger  way than the previous PPS 4 would have, and it will create greater flexibility  to develop a major infrastructural scheme such as the Titanic Quarter, which is  concentrated on employment, whereas, previously, we might have had to step  beyond the policies to grant such an approval.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement, and I welcome it. The Minister referred  to sectors such as life sciences and food processing. In my constituency, there  is a difficulty in relation to an existing application. Will the policy be  retrospective and apply to applications that are in the system?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to the draft tourism strategy, I am  disappointed that Lough Neagh did not feature strongly in the Minister&rsquo;s  statement. Will he have any discussions with the tourism Minister in relation  to the designation of Craigavon as a tourism centre, given its proximity to the  southern shores of Lough Neagh?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: PPS 4 becomes a policy from today. Therefore, any live applications  will be dealt with under that policy. The policy that I am looking at would  give greater support for economic considerations than is currently the case. It  would also look at projects that could negatively impact on existing businesses  and, therefore, lead to a negative conclusion of a planning application if it  would affect jobs and damage job opportunities. I hope, in the not-too-distant  future, to get the approval of the Executive for that further policy and to  bring it to the Floor of the House. It is important that we create a suite of  planning policies that can sustain and support businesses.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Draft PPS 16 is a planning policy document. It is for the  area plans to identify areas that are designated for tourism opportunity.  However, if there are particular issues in relation to Craigavon and tourism  that the Member wishes to raise, my door is always open for discussion on  planning proposals, and I am sure that Minister Foster&rsquo;s door is always open  for discussion on developing tourism opportunities. We will be happy to speak  to the Member on those issues.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  Today&rsquo;s statement is undoubtedly very welcome, as a number of people in our  constituencies were waiting with bated breath to see what the Minister was  going to say, particularly in relation to PPS 4. With the introduction of PPS  4, will the Minister confirm that there will be flexibility for economic  development in rural communities? Many people are waiting for the statement to  see what new things have been brought in from the existing PPS 4.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to PPS 16, can the Minister be more explicit?  He says that a hotel will be allowed in the countryside where the proposals  involve redevelopment of an appropriate existing building. Can he tell us  whether that covers any building? What does he have in mind?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: There remains a significant supply of employment land in  statutory plans. If we identify a shortage of land in any council area, an  article 31 planning application can provide a mechanism by which suitable  proposals can be considered through the development management system, rather than  waiting for the preparation of a new area plan.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We also seek to protect zoned land and existing employment  uses from unnecessary loss to alternative uses. We also wish to make provision  for economic development proposals outwith development plans, such as  redevelopment of existing employment sites in rural areas and proposals on the  outskirts of small settlements where land is not available within them.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As for the development of buildings for hotels, and so  forth, I do not think that developing an ordinary farmhouse or hay shed into a  hotel would really stack up and create a plethora of development opportunities  for hotels right across the country that would never actually be fulfilled.  There are a lot of significant buildings in the countryside that would lend  themselves to that practice. There are areas that have particular tourist  needs. If those can be identified, there are opportunities for a level of  development to take place. It does not create a free-for-all; that is not what  we wish to do in bringing forward the document. A free-for-all is not good for  tourism, nor is it good for business. There needs to be a means by which  business can thrive and develop without creating opportunities for people who  have no real interest in delivering something to simply jump on the bandwagon.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement, which strikes a good balance between  economic development and protection of the countryside. I particularly welcome  draft PPS 16 and its proposal to ban random, inappropriate and excessive  development in the countryside. Does the Minister not agree that it conflicts  with PPS 21, which has created bungalow blight in many of the most attractive  areas of the countryside?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I was somewhat concerned that Mr Wilson had agreed with me  on something. For a moment, I considered tendering my resignation. As he went  on, however, it became fairly clear that we do not agree, so I am happy enough  now.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Of course draft PPS 16 does not conflict with PPS 21. Draft  PPS 16, PPS 21 and PPS 4 are a combination of policies that have been brought  together and are built around sustainability. Sustainability does not mean  doing nothing. I want to make that absolutely clear. There is a particular  lobby that believes that doing nothing is sustainable. Doing nothing would lead  to small villages becoming depopulated and losing their shops, facilities and  employment opportunities. Church congregations would get smaller and churches  would, possibly, have to close because the local population is in decline. That  is not sustainable development. Sustainable development is about creating an  opportunity for people to inhabit and live in rural communities in a way that  does not impact negatively on them.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I challenge the Member on the issue of bungalow blight. We  are not going down the Donegal route of creating a bungalow in every hole in  the hedge. We have created our own planning policy, which is based on clusters.  Where there is existing development, it can be added to or filled out in a way  that is complementary to it and does not litter the countryside with bungalows  that are dotted on every hill.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We are bringing forward and putting in place sustainable  policies. The two particular policies that I have brought forward today will  add to and enhance that, and will create development and employment  opportunities for sustainable communities.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  Like my colleagues, I welcome the statement on PPS 4 and PPS 16. I have two  questions for the Minister. In relation to PPS 16, an application has been in  the system since 2007. It seems unfortunate that the Planning Service has  brought it forward this week for refusal, because I see an extension to an aparthotel  in Templepatrick, which is in my constituency. Surely that application could be  revisited before a decision is issued?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">For a number of years, Antrim Borough Council, in which I  declare an interest as a member, has lobbied hard for economic development. The  council believes that there have been insufficient lands in the borough for  such development. How does the Minister know how much land is needed for  economic and industrial development in the future?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: PPS 16 is a draft policy. Decisions cannot, therefore, be  taken on the basis of that policy, but it should be a material consideration in  the decision-making process. If the planning application has been in the system  for three years and consultation with the council is taking place only now,  this document will have relevance to any such application.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member asked about identifying the need for industrial  land use. There are difficulties relating to the Antrim area plan and its  current status. Perhaps we will deal with that in the very near future as we  look at how area plans can be brought forward. There is no foolproof way of  estimating the amount of land that is required for future growth. We provide  advice on how to estimate future land requirements. That advice is based on  past trends in the take-up of land, and we take in the views of councils,  Departments and the local business community, together with emerging guidance  from the Department for Regional Development&rsquo;s (DRD) major review of the  regional development strategy. In 2009, a consultant study commissioned by DRD  confirmed that there was unlikely to be a shortage of business land for the  foreseeable future. In addition, as part of recent baseline monitoring with  council transitional committees to help to inform future proposals, the  Planning Service is undertaking preliminary work on the amount of industrial  and business land available in development plans.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We must identify more land than might be used, because, if  growth takes off and opportunities are created, we do not want to be in a  position in which the Northern Ireland Government end up hindering those  business opportunities. In the event of a period of growth, it is always good  to have identified a surplus of land.</p>
      <p class="H4StageHeading" style="page-break-before:always;"><a name="2"></a>Welfare Reform</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I have received notice from the Minister for Social Development  that he wishes to make a statement.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development (Mr Attwood)</strong>: Members will be aware that this will be a  rather lengthy statement. I assure Members that it is not an attempt to drive  them out of the Chamber so that I can avoid questions. Rather, it is an attempt  to rebalance the political and public debate in Northern Ireland by acknowledging  the issues that relate to capital and revenue and, equally, to welfare.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly will recall that, on 28 September, it passed a  motion on welfare reform. It was agreed:</p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;That this Assembly acknowledges Northern Ireland&rsquo;s high  dependency on social security benefits; supports reforms which are aimed at  simplifying the social security process and helping people to get back to work;  and calls on the Minister for Social Development to continue his dialogue with  the Department for Work and Pensions, stressing the need for the special social  and economic circumstances of Northern Ireland to be carefully considered and  urging the introduction of appropriate measures to ensure that the proposed  welfare reforms do not have a disproportionately negative impact on Northern  Ireland.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That was a significant motion. It recognised the  ferocity of the benefit cuts being implemented and the scale of welfare reform  being planned by the London Government. Given the motion and what has developed  in respect of benefit cuts and welfare changes, even since 28 September, a mere  eight weeks ago, I have an obligation to return to the Floor of the Assembly to  give an account of where things reside. I also anticipate going before the  Social Development Committee in the next two weeks to assess those and other  related matters as we go forward.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">11.15 am</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In making the statement today, I have a number of  objectives. The first is to outline the scale of benefit cuts that the  Chancellor of the Exchequer and the London Government are imposing in their  June emergency Budget and October Budget. Secondly, I wish to scope out the  welfare reform agenda now being disclosed by the Tory/Liberal coalition almost  on a weekly basis. I anticipate that even this week there will be more  announcements from Iain Duncan Smith in respect of reform of the welfare  process. Thirdly, I wish to detail the strategy that I have been pursuing to  argue against benefit cuts on the one hand and the range of welfare changes on  the other. Fourthly, I will explain how the Department for Social Development  (DSD) is intervening and how, in my view, the Executive can intervene to  protect those who are in need and are disadvantaged, critically over the next  five years.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will turn first to the scale of the benefit cuts detailed  in the two London Budgets. In doing so, I recall what the Chancellor said in  the opening words of his October Budget speech, when he explicitly and  deliberately referred to &ldquo;waste&rdquo; and &ldquo;welfare&rdquo; in the same sentence. I found  the association of those concepts &mdash; waste and welfare &mdash; in sequential words in  an opening paragraph of a Budget statement revealing, and I considered it  deeply wrong and deeply worrying.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Some &pound;18 billion of welfare cuts are being imposed, driven  through and carried forward. The read across of those welfare cuts to Northern Ireland  is up to &pound;500 million. That is money withdrawn from the pockets of people in  need and from the economy. The London Government have announced a vast scale of  changes involving a substantial reduction in payable benefits for mortgage  interest, local housing allowance (LHA) and incapacity benefit. Those are  complex, technical and difficult matters to fully grasp the significance of,  but for the purposes of this statement, I will try to scope them out as best I  can.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">First, the support for mortgage interest (SMI) scheme has  already reduced the interest payable from 6&middot;08% to 3&middot;63%. In addition, the SMI  scheme for those who have claimed jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance since January 2009 is  limited to 104 weeks. As I understand it, a person in that category will  receive mortgage interest support for only two years. It appears that, after  two years, people in that category will receive no support towards their  mortgage interest. In the past number of days, I have tasked officials to scope  out the significance of that intervention and measures and means to mitigate  the impact on people who are in mortgage difficulties, mortgage arrears or who  are at risk of losing their homes, especially given the potential for so many  people to lose their jobs in the coming years.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">From April 2011, a number of changes will be applied to  LHA. LHA rates in the private-rented sector will be restricted according to the  size of accommodation, and monetary caps will be introduced. Current statistics  show that, in Northern    Ireland, there are 454 households that will  be directly affected by that change. From April 2011, excess payments &mdash; whereby  claimants can receive up to &pound;15 per week in addition to their award of housing  benefit where the contractual rent is lower than the LHA rate for their  property &mdash; will be removed. According to our figures, there are 7,247 claimants  receiving excess payments of varying amounts up to &pound;15 per week and 4,205  receiving excess payments of &pound;5 or more.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">With effect from October 2011, the LHA rate will be set at  the thirtieth percentile of rents in each broad rental market area rather than,  as at present, the fiftieth percentile. There are around 38,000 claimants  receiving benefit assessed under the LHA scheme. The new change will result in  an average reduction of awards to private sector claimants in Northern Ireland  of &pound;7<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; ">&#8729;</span>50 per week. That will  represent an annual reduction of over &pound;14 million in total and will be likely  to place further pressure on the discretionary housing payment budget.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly will understand that this change will impact  not only on claimants already affected by a restriction to the four-bedroom  rate, but on the wider social market. That is a major change, with big  consequences, which I will comment on later.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I move from LHA to incapacity benefit (IB). The Assembly  will be aware that Northern Ireland  has a significantly higher rate of incapacity benefit claimants than Britain. I  resent the attempts made by the few in recent times to demonise those who  happen to be on IB. There are good historical reasons for that situation. For  instance, levels of multiple deprivation, the legacy of conflict, and how those  manifest in the physical and mental capacity of many people. I resent the fact  that so many people may wrongly feel that they are being targeted and demonised  because they legitimately claim IB.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A programme reassessing all existing IB claimants will  begin here in May 2011 that will see claimants moved onto employment support  allowance or jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance. One estimate, which I think is fairly  accurate, is that that could be around 23% of the approximately 90,000 current  claimants. Those people will then be deemed to be unemployed. That is one  reason why some people fear that 80,000, 90,000 or 100,000 will be out of work  in the coming years in Northern    Ireland. Last Monday in the Assembly, I  spoke to one person who has a particular knowledge of this matter. She said  that there is the potential for 110,000 people to become unemployed. That would  be as high as the figure that we experienced in the early 1980s.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In any case, given the context of the Northern Ireland  labour market, it is unlikely that suitable work will be available for  substantial numbers of claimants who may have limited skills or work  experience. The difficulties of moving a significant number of individuals who  have little or no skills or work experience to a benefit that requires them to  seek work to and exist on a significantly lower level of income should not be underestimated.  That is a crucial point. Limited work opportunities and increasing unemployment  &mdash; a situation that may be compounded by the economic developments and  borrowings in the Republic of Ireland &mdash; make a nonsense of proposals to get  those who are capable of working back into work, when there is simply no work  available.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As well as fundamental reform of the benefit system, the  coalition Government have announced the implementation of the work programme.  They say it is:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;a single integrated package of support providing  personalised help for everyone who finds themselves out of work, regardless of  the benefit they claim&rdquo; .</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">It is claimed:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;It will focus on helping people into sustained jobs  and pay delivery partners &hellip; by the results they achieve&rdquo;.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) is  moving quickly and aims to have the work programme in place by the summer of  2011. I support helping people who are capable of working to get into work.  However, a return to the politics of Thatcher and Tebbit &mdash; out the door and on  your bike &mdash; for a four-week programme is not the sustained, structured, personalised,  long-term approach that is needed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A second phase of benefit cuts is now beginning to roll out  for the medium term. Those changes, which will depress the level of welfare  support, will follow rapidly. From April 2012, the LHA shared-room rate will be  extended to cover single people aged 35 and under. The previous limit was 25  years. That could lead to greater numbers being homeless and pressure on services  for homeless people in the context of difficult, domestic and home  environments. Every Member will have had people in constituency offices or  making contact with them about this matter. All Members appreciate that  domestic and home environments can be very difficult sometimes for a range of  serious, if not grave, circumstances. People have to try to get out of those  properties and those living environments. This proposal will impede people from  having the opportunity to do that, and could result in a greater level of  homelessness. From April 2013, housing benefit claimants who are also claiming  jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance will only receive their full housing benefit for a period  of 12 months.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">After that period, their benefit will be reduced by 10%,  and they will be ineligible for the full out-of-work housing benefit rate until  they have left the benefits system and have worked for a period. Currently,  that change would affect approximately 22,500 claimants. It would put increased  pressure on those who are dependent on housing benefit, with no rationale to  try to get people back into work. I know that the issue is acknowledged and  appreciated very much by Members because they have spoken to me in the past 24  hours about its impact.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">To dramatise graphically what that particular proposal is  about and highlight the particular severity and ferocity of the thinking behind  it, let me recount a recent conversation that I had with a senior Tory. In  defence of the proposal, he explained that if someone in a street lost their job,  had to sell their home and downsize, then it was fair that a person living next  door in rented accommodation should lose out, too. I understood, from the words  of this senior Tory, that if someone loses out through no fault of their own  and through circumstances beyond their control that give rise to them having to  downsize and sell up their valued home, someone else living next door should  lose out also, regardless of consequences. Members can make their own judgement  on that. In my view, it is one of the most abhorrent of the welfare proposals,  revealing a dogmatic hand. I will come back to that point later.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A further change to housing benefit will see linked changes  to child tax credit to remove what is known as the baby element. Approximately  1,085 claimants who qualify for increased housing benefit family premium will  see a reduction of up to &pound;7 a week for rent and &pound;2 a week for rates. The  regulation to implement that change was debated at the Committee for Social  Development last week. I wanted to test the temperature of the Committee to see  how far Members may wish to go to challenge parity or to take measures to  protect those in need as a result of the proposed regulation. I will comment  further on that later.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">All this is coming down the pipe to the people of Northern Ireland  over the next one or two years. However, I want to scope out the scale of the  proposed welfare reform agenda of the British Government, which will result in  a more fundamental reworking of welfare over the next number of years. In my  view, it will mean the most significant change to the welfare regime in 40  years.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The review is the work of the Secretary of State for Work  and Pensions, Iain Duncan Smith. As I think I have said in the Chamber before,  when one meets him, he is not the man one sees on television. He appears to  have deep convictions around the issues of welfare, he has strong views about  how welfare should be reformed, and he is acting as best he can to achieve what  he is proposing. That may be the case, but I fundamentally differ from him in  some of his approaches.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The most significant reform in 40 years will remodel the  welfare system into something very different. It will cost billions of pounds  to implement; billions that will be funded in part by the Chancellor&rsquo;s up-front  benefit cuts in the two Budgets of this year. There are principles behind  welfare reform that could unite many. We should provide assistance to people  who are capable of work to help them to move from long-term benefit reliance to  the self-sufficiency of work. When people make that transition, it should pay  them to work. However, from a purely Northern Ireland perspective,  acknowledging that some elements of the proposals may make sense in the  prosperous south of England, the measures announced look like a major onslaught  on low-income households.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will touch on a number of measures. Changes to disability  allowance are focused on those who are of working age and will involve a new  medical assessment that is akin to the work capability assessment that is  applied to those who are on incapacity benefit. I understand that further  consultation proposals in that regard are imminent.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">11.30 am</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Changes are also planned to the social fund. It is proposed  in Britain  to transfer community care grants, funeral payments and crisis loans to local  authorities, with loan schemes being considered for outsourcing to the  voluntary sector. Winter fuel payments and cold weather payments are to be  retained by DWP, which advised that social fund proposals for reform may be  advanced over the next two weeks. I have raised that issue and its management  with DWP Ministers.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The coalition Government&rsquo;s plans for the state pension are  to speed up the pace of state pension age equalisation for women from April  2016, which is an interesting date, so that women&rsquo;s state pension age reaches  65 in November 2018. The state pension age will then increase to 66 for men and  women from December 2018 to April 2020. Following the faster increase to 66  years, the Government are also considering future increases to state pension  age.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I understand that changes are being considered to child  maintenance. I want to protect the very positive work that the child  maintenance enforcement division (CMED) has taken forward over recent years in  support of children. It was not long ago that the Child Support Agency, as it  was then known, was not an institution that earned public confidence, never  mind family and parental confidence. CMED has turned that around substantially  and, recently, it initiated a stakeholder group to build the relationship  between those in the child sector and the agency to make sure that deeper  confidences develop. I understand that officials in DWP are working on options  in that regard, and I have spoken and written to Maria Miller to reduce the  risk of undermining CMED when child-support mechanisms are now better accepted  in the context of the need for stability amid the turbulence that is created by  aggressive reform.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Through the recent publication of the White Paper on  universal credit, which is a fundamental document with immense impact, the  Secretary of State has signalled the coalition Government&rsquo;s intention to  introduce universal credit to replace a range of working-age benefits,  including income support, income-related employment and support allowance,  income-related jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, child tax credit, working tax credit,  housing benefit and some aspects of the social fund. The stated aim of the  universal credit is to reform the system of benefits and tax credits for people  of working age to improve work incentives, reduce benefit dependency and  simplify the system.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The London Government also claim that universal credit  seeks to improve the transition between inactivity and work; improve usability  for the individual and reduce administration by reducing the number of  different benefits, delivery agencies and processes; and make sure that work  pays by simplifying the interaction between entitlement and earnings by  increasing the amount of earnings that people can have without losing benefits  and reducing the rate at which benefit is withdrawn as earnings rise.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As I have said already, there are principles with which  many could agree, but I have deep and growing concerns about the changes that  have been announced already. It seems that the process is designed  substantially to lower the platform of welfare support from which the universal  credit proposals will be launched in two years&rsquo; time. That is a key point for  the London Government: if the welfare platform is reduced, top-line expenditure  can be cut as a preamble to reform. There are real dangers for us. Northern Ireland is unlikely to come out of  recession for at least two years and already experiences some of the highest  levels of deprivation in Britain.  There are real legacies of the conflict that involve many thousands of our most  vulnerable people who are dependent on social welfare. Furthermore, welfare  reform that is seen to compound the experience of the most vulnerable, for  example, through increased homelessness, may create instability.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The reason that I wanted to detail the narrative of the  first, second and third phases of welfare cuts and reform is to demonstrate the  relentless designs of the British Government to rework benefit and welfare in  the image of something different from what has been heretofore and, arguably,  to what has been in place for the past 40 years. The scale of that narrative  conveys the scale of the issue and, therefore, should convey the scale of our  response to me, as Minister, to the Executive and to the Assembly.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I turn now to that response. Although social security is a  devolved matter, we are constrained by funding issues. Any variance from DWP  social security rates and conditions may breach parity. It would be thoughtless  folly, therefore, if I, as the Minister for Social Development, took action  that put in greater need those already in need. Parity brings a net benefit to Northern Ireland  measured in billions of pounds. One figure given to me recently suggests that  when the total tax take in Northern Ireland  that goes to the Treasury is deducted from the total Budget and welfare  payments that come across the Irish Sea, the  net benefit to the Executive and the Assembly is at least &pound;3 billion.  Nevertheless, I believe that the issue of parity should be considered and  scoped, although doing that in a rush would hurt those whom we need to protect most  over the next four or five very difficult years.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, some principles in the universal credit  proposals may have some attraction, such as those providing for the  simplification of the system, clearer conditionality and better financial  support for people moving off benefits and into work. However, many changes to  the level of benefit support that are already being introduced will reduce significantly  the support available through social welfare, impacting on tens of thousands of  people and having a depressing effect on our regional economy.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">What has been my and DSD&rsquo;s response to date? I will not  outline all of the Department&rsquo;s thinking, the issues that we are scoping or the  responses that we may introduce or propose. However, I will scope in broad  detail the range of responses that I have undertaken as Minister in the past  number of months. First, as Members are aware and as was reflected in the  motion that the Assembly passed in September, I have engaged on an ongoing  basis the London Ministers in DWP: Iain Duncan Smith; Lord Freud; Chris  Grayling; and Maria Miller. They are in no doubt about my view that, be it on  the Budget or on benefits, particular circumstances here &mdash; higher levels of  deprivation, as in parts of Britain, compounded by the legacy of conflict and  the risk of alienation &mdash; mean that London should have a particular response to  our needs.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If Ministers in London  tell me that they accept that analysis &mdash; as they do, because Iain Duncan Smith,  Lord Freud and Maria Miller have told me so &mdash; they must accept the consequences  of it. In my view, that means, or could mean, additional funds; hardship  provisions; recognition of local factors; or the ability to opt out, slow down  or reconfigure reforms in the image of our circumstances. If it does not mean  that &mdash; I am fearful that, for all that London Ministers tell me, they will not  act on what they tell me &mdash; London  will carry on regardless in the face of evidence, disregarding the very  circumstances that they say that they recognise.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will meet Lord Freud again next Monday, and, as I  outlined, my discussions will be informed by a number of principles. The  planned changes should be implemented in a manner that recognises the  difficulties in areas of high unemployment in general and that has regard to  the Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  particular circumstances. I will argue for the maximum flexibility to be  allowed when implementing changes. As Members will be aware from the passage of  the Welfare Reform Bill before the summer, there has been some flexibility to  date. I want to expand on that, and I am actively scoping how that might be  achieved.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Where appropriate, I will seek to introduce changes more  slowly, because it is likely to take Northern Ireland longer to come out  of the current economic recession. To follow slavishly the London Government&rsquo;s  design and timeline for welfare reform, without measuring it against the  particular historical, current and, in the light of the economic downturn,  future circumstances, is not credible, mature or a considered way in which to  proceed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, I plan to manage welfare change &mdash; if manage it  I must &mdash; in a way that deals with the real-time objective needs of the various  categories of people who may be in need. Given differences in age profiles and  economic background, welfare reform may be directed towards one category or  group of individuals rather than another.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Moreover, because of the ongoing research that I am  undertaking, on which I will comment shortly, and the consequential assessments  that will be made, DSD, the Social Security Agency (SSA) and the Executive will  be in a position to identify the fault lines, gaps and dangers of welfare  reform, and argue, plan or legislate against them.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is my very strong view that, if welfare reform is to be  sustainable and practical, it should be introduced in phases, and slowly. All  the evidence suggests that to go for the big bang in welfare reform, will, over  time, cause it to unravel, create disproportionate difficulties and hurt, in an  even greater sense, those who are most in need. By my Department doing the  research that identifies how welfare reform may have an impact, and where the  fault lines, gaps and dangers are, we will have an early start in arguing with London and in deciding  among ourselves what the best responses should be.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There are other principles that, for the purpose of best  negotiations and outcomes with and from London,  I shall not outline here. However, the objective is more freedom, and/or more  resources and/or more independence, in a way that will not adversely affect the  block grant or the net billions of pounds paid in benefits to our citizens and  communities. As I said, making assessments about all those matters, and where  they lead us, is crucial. That is why I have made it clear to DSD and to the  SSA that, in ensuring that people have quick and efficient access to benefits,  they do not simply do welfare. The Department and the SSA must challenge,  interrogate and manage welfare for the benefit of our citizens, and I have  taken three steps to do so.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Research has been commissioned that will provide  information on the consequences of the changes announced by the coalition  Government. Research will identify the impact of new procedures on assessing  people&rsquo;s capability for work through the new employment support allowance  (ESA), and those who will be in receipt of incapacity benefit (IB) from April  2011. Further work will tell us how the new procedures will affect those who  have been disengaged from the labour market for a long time and what their  needs might be. As I have already said, Northern Ireland could lose up to  &pound;500 million payable in benefits during the SR10 period. Therefore, I have also  commissioned work that will tell us what the consequences of the cuts that have  been announced to date by the coalition Government will be for the incomes of  those who are dependent on welfare benefits.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">At the same time, I have been consulting widely on what our  best response should be to the recently announced cuts and the longer-term  plans for universal credit. I believe that by availing myself of the best  advice from DSD and from community experts and organisations, I will have  access to evidence to create a basis for protecting and materially helping  those in need.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department and the SSA have been instructed to identify  what it would cost and how it would be done were the Belfast Government to  deploy a number of interventions to protect those in need and mitigate the  Budget cuts. I shall not detail the shape of all that, because it would betray  my hand in advance of the meeting with Lord Freud in six days&rsquo; time. It is  still a work in progress. Costings are being worked up and the interventions  may, in some cases, require Executive endorsement. A range of interventions may  be required, including financial and personal assistance, advocacy and other  measures to protect those in need. This is the point at which I return to my  comments about the impact of a reduction in mortgage interest support, the  attempt to undo the baby element of child tax credit and the other most severe  welfare changes. We must ask ourselves if and how we can intervene on those and  other matters.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am also attempting to bring together some of the best  practitioners of welfare issues to bear down on the welfare changes and  proposals and work out all the best responses. Experts in the social welfare  field are working with officials to plan our response to the already announced  cuts and the longer-term plans for universal credit. Officials are working with  Professor Eileen Evason, Les Allamby from the Northern Ireland Law Centre, and  the economist Philip McDonagh to monitor the impact of the wider welfare  changes.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A group involving Advice NI, Citizens Advice, the Housing  Rights Service and the Housing Executive is considering the impact of  reductions in the mortgage interest scheme, and Professor Malcolm Harrington  will soon review the impact of using the work capability assessment here. I  have also tasked a group of senior officials with monitoring and advising me on  the changes that will be necessary to ensure that the implementation of the  changes under universal credit are taken forward in a manner that is relevant  to meet Northern Ireland&rsquo;s circumstances.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">11.45 am</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will resolutely oppose certain proposed changes, such as  the 10% cut in housing benefit for those on jobseekers allowance (JSA) for more  than 12 months. I want to identify how to offset the damage and, indeed, to  determine whether there are ways to avoid the cut&rsquo;s implementation here. That  is an issue of fundamental fairness, and I recognise that it is also an issue  of parity. I do not shirk any of that; we should begin to address all of it. I  am also taking forward work that will complement my actions on welfare reform,  which are designed to protect those most in need. I recognise that issues of  welfare cannot be taken or addressed in isolation. People who rely on benefits substantially  rely on social housing, and, therefore, questions on access to welfare cannot  be divorced from those on access to housing.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">This is not the Assembly statement in which to expand too  much on housing issues. However, I plan to return to the Assembly before  Christmas with a further statement on housing responses in times of need. That  shall build and expand on my predecessor&rsquo;s new housing agenda, which defined  new territory for housing policy. The statement, which will be titled &lsquo;Housing  Responses in Times of Need&rsquo; will aim to build the maximum number of homes;  herald the necessary reform of housing associations, Mr Craig; create  mechanisms to ensure that public moneys for housing use are best spent; and  initiate fresh attempts and deepen ongoing attempts at positive housing reform.  It will establish more fully the welfare/housing axis and identify real time  solutions for the protection of those in need.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Some initiatives are ongoing. Through the Housing Rights  Service, work has already begun to protect those who risk losing their homes because  of difficulties with mortgage repayments. The mortgage debt advice service has  already advised 755 clients. Homelessness has been prevented in 180 cases, and  16 potential evictions have been cancelled. The Housing Rights Service estimate  that a minimum of &pound;1&middot;2 million has been saved to the public purse through  avoiding potential homelessness. I am working to extend that scheme until 2015.  The funding for a mortgage rescue scheme, which has been often refused, must  now be approved, and, as I said earlier, I will take a range of initiatives to  protect those in mortgage stress. I will inform the Social Development  Committee about that work in due course.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Fuel poverty is part of the welfare narrative. The fuel  poverty figures are high, many are dependent on oil, prices are rising, and  there is virtually no energy brokering. In light of that, government has the  means and the will to do more. Again, I will not detain the Assembly much on  that issue, but I may make a statement shortly when I launch a fuel poverty  strategy for times of need. I aim to stretch the limits of what can be done and  not only build on the good work in energy efficiency but break new ground in  energy brokering. We cannot ignore the two major determinants of fuel poverty,  namely low incomes and high fuel prices.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The point of all of this is clear: we should proof  government spending and public initiatives against the welfare test and ask  whether spending, policy or government initiatives better the circumstances of  those on welfare. No aspect of government is excluded, and that means  procurement, too. I will do what can be done through discussions with London, through working  with the Department and the Social Security Agency, and through developing  interventions to address what is already a serious and potentially grave  situation. However, in my judgement and certainly in my heart, more can be  done.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will not detain the Assembly by talking about the ongoing  Budget negotiations, save to make one point. The family of responsibilities in  the Department, namely welfare, housing, child maintenance and neighbourhood  renewal, are all about people, families, communities, lone parents and older  citizens who are in need and in disadvantage. If one essential value of the  Budget is not to protect them, it will not be much of a Budget, and we will not  be much of a Government. However, the Executive will need to decide and agree  on what measures, beyond the funds of DSD, will be needed to achieve the  objective of protecting those in need.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I shall forward to the Executive a remedies paper in which  I will include a wider analysis of how we should take forward the issue of  social welfare. It will recommend a range of interventions as part of the  Budget conclusions on welfare, fuel poverty and housing that the Executive  should endorse if we are to be judged favourably and judge ourselves favourably  on how we address the severity of welfare changes.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will do what can be done on AME to mitigate the benefit  impact, but, as an Executive, including DSD, we should do what can be done on  the departmental expenditure limit if we are to offset the ferocity of London welfare decisions.  I am encouraged that my Executive colleagues acknowledge that the jigsaw of our  finances over the next four years is made up not only of the revenue budget and  the capital budget but of the welfare budget and how that works itself through  in the lives of our citizens.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">People say that there will be 100,000 people unemployed and  that there will be a wave of poverty. Only two weeks ago, the head of an  educational organisation used that description to me. We must be vigilant and  act against such a possibility. The people of Northern Ireland have a resilience  that has been proven in times of threat and terror. Our people are well  skilled, well educated and, given a fair chance, well placed to go forward  positively. In doing so, the test of our wisdom and maturity is how we protect  those on welfare and in need. We must not let them down.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Social Development (Mr Hamilton)</strong>: I welcome the  Minister&rsquo;s statement, and, given its length, I thank him for keeping the  Assembly well briefed about the impact of the proposed changes to the social  security system. He and I may not always see eye to eye on every detail of  welfare reform, but we are as one in our opposition to the coalition&rsquo;s crude  cuts to welfare, which will have a severely detrimental impact on the  vulnerable people in our society.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Can the Minister inform the House of any deliberations that  he has had with the Department for Work and Pensions on the possible retention  of AME savings that are made as a result of expenditure from our Budget? Will  he agree that, although we should, as we always have, test what flexibility  there is in the social security system and test welfare reform, any step that  the Executive take that breaches parity and which puts under threat the over &pound;3  billion in welfare subvention that we receive every year would be a step too  far?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for his question. I acknowledge  that, as Chairperson of the Committee and as an MLA, Mr Hamilton has  demonstrated that, whatever passing differences we may have on one or two  issues, especially on the issue of parity, we are on the same page when it  comes to the severity and ferocity of what London has been doing. I have made the point  previously that, in October, when the Chancellor partnered the words &ldquo;waste&rdquo;  and &ldquo;welfare&rdquo; and outlined &pound;7 billion of further cuts on top of the &pound;11 billion  of cuts that had been outlined in June&rsquo;s emergency Budget, it hit deeply,  including with the political community in Northern Ireland. That is why I welcome  the comments of the Chairperson of the Committee and the motion to which he  spoke a number of weeks ago. I welcome the fact that, by and large, we are on  the same page.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A conversation has taken place with the Treasury on the  issue of saving money from AME. For example, as a result of various fraud  interventions by the Social Security Agency, the amount of fraud might be  reduced, thereby reducing the amount of money being paid under AME. There was a  discussion about the potential that all or part of those savings thereby  identified would come back to the Department. That conversation was initiated,  but I am advised by the Department of Finance and Personnel (DFP) that it was  concluded in the context of the Budget announcement on the block grant for Northern Ireland.  I regret that, and I believe that there might still be some opportunity to  exploit the potential that part or all of any savings from AME, for example,  arising from fraud intervention measures that reduce the cost to the London  Exchequer, could be retained by the Department.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am anxious that any Barnett consequentials passed to the  Northern Ireland Executive under the block grant to fund the implementation of  welfare reform, especially as it begins to accelerate over the next two to  three years, come across to the Department in full. There are ongoing  conversations to determine whether the Barnett consequentials for welfare  reform, on both the capital and revenue sides, have been transferred in full.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will not put those in need into further need  unnecessarily through a reckless approach to parity. However, I will stretch  the limits of parity in a way that does not prejudice the block grant or those  who are on benefits. That is part of the conversation with Lord Freud. We must  maximise the opportunities within the constraints of parity. Parity is  contentious and cross-cutting and is of interest to Executive colleagues. I may  be minded to break parity. However, if I were, it would go nowhere unless the  Executive said, &ldquo;This is a line in the sand that we will not compromise on.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As I have indicated, one of the lines in the sand has to be  the proposal to reduce housing benefit by 10% after one year when a person has  claimed jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance. The punitive nature of that intervention invites  me and, I think, Members and Executive colleagues to determine whether that is  a right and sustainable approach that we should consider in the context of  parity. Beyond that, as I have indicated in a remedies paper to the Executive,  there may be opportunities without compromising parity whereby the Executive  decide to protect those in need, over and above whatever interventions might  come from DSD. I hope that, at the very least, when the Executive see the  remedies paper, they may see fit to endorse it.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  statement, but I certainly do not welcome it because he has, rightly, given us  a litany of doom and gloom for the past 40 minutes or so. Does the Minister  agree that these are not significant changes to the welfare system but, in  fact, the dismantling of the welfare state as we know it? He talked about  scoping out parity, but does he also agree that until the fundamental tenet of  parity is challenged, the &ldquo;reforms&rdquo; will go through? I am not sure how, unless  parity is challenged, people who are already being impacted on so greatly can  be impacted on even more. The changes that we are talking about would have the  greatest impact since the inception of the welfare state in 1948.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for his question, particularly  because I was a little fearful that he would ask me a technical question on  some of the changes. I would certainly defer to the Member&rsquo;s knowledge on many  of these matters, so I am grateful that the question is more political than  technical.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We can perceive the Chancellor&rsquo;s political narrative in the  decisions made in the June to October Budget and in his use of language. It was  also shown in the dogmatic comments that were made by others at a senior level  in the Tory party to me and Danny Kennedy, who was at the same meeting. I fear  that that commentary means the dismantling of the welfare state as we know it.  I have to acknowledge that. I think that Iain Duncan Smith has more lofty  ambitions.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">He has genuine conviction about remodelling the welfare  benefit system in a way that simplifies it, makes work pay and encourages  people out of welfare reliance and into self-sufficiency through work. His  character and the colour of his ambitions are different from those of the  Chancellor, who wants narrower and more aggressive welfare cuts. Iain Duncan  Smith has achieved his objective, through universal credit, of a fundamental  reworking of that system. However, the Chancellor has also achieved his  ambition of massive and ferocious upfront benefit cuts, which was the price  paid for Mr Duncan Smith&rsquo;s getting what he wanted.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">12.00 noon</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to make one comment about parity, with which I will  not play political games. I believe that we, along with the Dublin Government  and others who have an interest, should begin to scope the future shape of  welfare benefits to see whether there are any adjustments or reconfigurations  that might serve our interests better. As I indicated before, that is why &Eacute;amon  &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, the Minister with responsibility for welfare in the South, and I  decided some time ago to begin to scope the shape of welfare benefits. Blue-sky  and long-term thinking are required, but they do not need to be implemented or  considered immediately. Nonetheless, we must stand back and look at those  issues in the round and in a more fundamental way.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Is the Member saying to me that this is the moment to  fundamentally challenge parity and to put on the table our position about  whether we want Northern Ireland to retain or to jettison the &pound;3 billion of net  financial gain? Is the Member asking me whether we should put all that on the  table and negotiate with the British Government today or this week? If so, I  must to say to him that today or this week is not the time to do that because,  given the number of people who may become unemployed and the range and severity  of benefit cuts and revenue and capital cuts, it would set up the people in the  North for an even more disproportionate impact on their lives.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Let us scope that to see whether we can begin to have  ownership of corporation tax and enterprise zones and responsibility for our  financial affairs. However, let us do it on a judicious, measured and ongoing  basis rather than rushing into putting parity on the table when we have not  worked through the full cost consequences of that, never mind the full  consequences of it on those in need. The British Government may want a  conversation with us about parity, so that they can fundamentally adjust the block  grant and reduce the cost benefit of parity to Northern Ireland in a way that  would damage the stability and lives of many of our citizens.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I draw Members&rsquo; attention to the fact that someone&rsquo;s mobile phone  is on and is interfering with the system.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  The Minister would not get any votes on &lsquo;The X Factor&rsquo; for this morning&rsquo;s  report; that is for sure. We all have great cause for enormous concern about  the benefit cuts outlined. Nevertheless, I thank the Minister for his statement.  Does he agree that the 10% cut in housing benefit for those who get jobseeker&rsquo;s  allowance for more than 12 months is particularly mean-spirited?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for her question. I tried to  outline, realistically and honestly, what the issues and problems are and what  the solutions might be. Regardless of whether those solutions are within the  gift of DSD or the Executive or are as a consequence of negotiations with London, I am trying to  maximise the answers, not simply pose questions. I took this opportunity to  make a statement to try to demonstrate that we are trying to leave no stone  unturned in responding to the situation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If members of the Committee have any suggestions about  other stones that need to be upturned in the way that Mr Brady suggested, my  door is open to them. I am willing to hear those suggestions and scope them  out.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Social security and the core DSD staff who deal with  welfare do great work. That is why I brought in, on a structured basis, people  such as Professor Eileen Evason, who know the inside track on welfare in Northern Ireland.  I brought those people in to the SSA and to DSD to advise me personally so that  any opportunities to deal with a solution could be maximised.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The proposal to cut housing benefit by 10% after  jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance has been received for one year was not just  mean-spirited, it was dogmatic, callous and uncaring. It is one of those  measures that, in the fullness of time, I think even the House of Commons will  baulk at. That is one reason why I have not tabled some of the recommendations  that have come across my desk to date.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  share and understand the concerns that the Minister outlined. However, will he  clarify his position on parity? He issued a statement today that, as he  confirmed in his answer to Mr Hamilton, talked about potentially breaching  parity. However, he then gave a sterling defence of parity in his response to  Mr Brady. There is a danger that a mixed message is going out on the matter.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">What common cause is the Minister trying to make with his  counterparts in Scotland and  Wales?  In trying to address through Westminster those concerns and the wider  interrelated issue of a lack of a proper UK regional policy, what use is the  Minister making of Northern Ireland MPs and those MPs from other poorer parts  of the United Kingdom?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for his question. As I said in the  closing words of my answer to the previous question, I believe that there are  opportunities through the House of Commons to derail one or more of the  proposals. That is why I said that, in the fullness of time, even the House of  Commons will baulk at the proposal to reduce housing benefit by 10% after one  year. The narrative that I gave of my conversation with a senior Tory and of  the way that he framed the proposal was very revealing. Being so revealing  gives plenty of opportunity for Members of the House of Commons to resist that  proposal.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will be exploring and exploiting any opportunities through  MPs. Given that there is unanimity on the matter in this Chamber and given the  motion that was passed on 28 September, it falls to all Members and all parties  to communicate between here and the House of Commons to ensure that there are  opportunities to deal with it. However, that goes beyond my responsibilities as  a Minister and as a member of a political party with representatives in the  House of Commons.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have had some brief conversations with a Minister and  Members from the Scottish Parliament. I note that, last week, the Scottish  Parliament passed only a one-year Budget. I very much hope that we do not  follow that example. I very much believe that we should have a four-year  Budget. People deserve, especially in the run-up to Christmas and into the new  year, certainty about their futures, including their job prospects. Whatever  conversations we have with people in Scotland, where the circumstances  are similar, we must remember that our circumstances are, in my view, more  complex and compound need more greatly. Although we may have conversations with  the devolved Scottish Administration, I hope that we do not follow their  example of having a one-year Budget.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Let me again create certainty and avoid doubt on the issue  of parity. In my statement, I suggested that, in my view, to rush head-on into  dealing with parity would be thoughtless folly. I have to say that I do not  think that that is sending out mixed messages. In my view, it is sending out a  very blunt message that it would be thoughtless folly to rush head-on into the  issue of parity. I discussed how we may deal with the issue of parity and said  that it would be dealt with in the longer term. We are going to scope out,  through blue-sky thinking, what the shape of welfare may be in the longer term,  including the shape of welfare on the island of Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will push parity to the limit. In recent years, and  before I or my predecessor took office, things may have been done differently  in Northern Ireland,  and they may have been technically inconsistent with parity. Therefore, parity  is not something that is never compromised. Indeed, as a result of what are  known as operational flexibilities, and because of our particular circumstances  and our decisions on how best to intervene to protect those in need, we may do  some things that are in the interest of Northern Ireland rather than of parity.  I want to extend and maximise operational flexibilities to enable us to do  that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will make two last points on Dr Farry&rsquo;s question. First,  if parity and parity legislation were to be slavishly followed, some  consequences of that would be so detrimental and prejudicial to the interests  of those in need that the Executive would have to seriously consider whether to  intervene and find the funding to mitigate their impact. Secondly, I may have a  view on parity, push its limits and be inclined, in my private moments, to  break from it because of my concern at what London is doing. However, the decision to  move away from parity is a cross-cutting and controversial matter, which  requires Executive endorsement. I may go to the Executive and scope ways to  take that matter forward. That would be a more rounded and multi-dimensional  way of dealing with the issue than making parity a god that we dare not offend.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:  Again, someone&rsquo;s mobile phone is switched on. Will Members please check that  their mobile phones are switched off?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement, although some elements of the welfare  reform proposals are quite worrying. The Minister did not mention disability  living allowance (DLA) in his statement, and rumours abound that certain  elements of it will disappear. Will the Minister update the House on whether  that is the case and whether DLA will form part of the proposed universal credit  system?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister mentioned that some people who are on  incapacity benefit will be moved to employment support allowance. Will there be  an appeals mechanism for those who feel that they have been unjustly moved?  Finally, the Minister mentioned that he would &ldquo;resolutely oppose&rdquo; a 10% cut in  housing benefit for those on jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance? Will the Minister outline  what he means by &ldquo;resolutely oppose&rdquo; and what that opposition will entail?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for his questions, and I will deal  with them in the order in which they were asked. I will not indulge the rumours  of others &mdash; not Mr Easton, but others outside the Chamber &mdash; on what may or may  not happen with DLA. However, we are close to the announcement on the next  phase of welfare reform that DWP wants to commence. That announcement may come  this week or next week, but it is coming soon, and it will include a further  fundamental review and assessment of DLA.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There will be an appeals mechanism for those who migrate  from IB to ESA, but the Member&rsquo;s question is timely and appropriate. I have  asked officials, through their work with the people whom I named, who are  external to the SSA and DSD, to find out what patterns are emerging among the  appeals and successful appeals of those who were moved from IB to ESA. I will  correct the record if I am in error, and Members should not rely too heavily on  this figure, but I understand that 40% of those who enter the appeals process  are successful.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, the question arises of whether there is a  pattern or system that we need to look at and adjust so that people who move  across do not lose their entitlement to the employment and support allowance  and have to go through the appeals system. The appeals system may throw up  lessons about how we administer migration to the employment and support  allowance. If there is learning and guidance that can be offered to those in  the social security offices who make the assessments, we should give that  assistance to our staff so that consistent good evidence and due process enable  people to get the benefit that they are entitled to rather than their having to  go through an appeals system that leads to 40% of successful appeals.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am resolutely opposed to the cut, and, earlier, I tried  to answer the question on how I am resolutely opposed to it. A system that  seems to me, both politically and personally, to be engineered to penalise one  person because someone else has suffered does not have any rationale, evidence  base or value beyond wanting to penalise the person who lives next door. There  should be a principle to intervene to help a person in mortgage stress. If that  does not work and someone loses their house and has to downsize, the obligation  to try to help the person who is living nearby in rented accommodation should  not be diminished or diluted. That is the ethic.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will resolutely oppose that cut by seeing whether DSD  and/or the Executive can intervene to help those people, including financially.  The cost consequences of such intervention may be so elaborate that it is not  feasible, or the cost consequences may be secondary to the fact that thousands  of people in that position will need help. As I indicated to Mr Farry, this is  one measure that has the potential to be derailed. This Chamber and the House  of Commons should gather forces. We should argue how offensive the proposal is  in any conversations that we have with any British Government Minister. If we  speak as one and work through the House of Commons and any other political  mechanism, we will be able to derail that proposal.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  statement. In his opening remarks, he mentioned people leaving the Chamber. I  am sorry now that I did not make my escape.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In his statement, the Minister talked about protecting  those most in need. Can the Minister give an assurance that, when he meets  Ministers and goes to London,  his priority is to protect the most vulnerable rather than to attack them? That  is what will happen under the reform. Given the proposed changes in Britain, how  does he envisage the social fund being administered? What training will staff  receive? Does the Minister believe that current staffing levels are adequate  for implementing the changes?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for those questions. I am tempted to  say that the word &ldquo;escape&rdquo; may not be the most appropriate language for a Sinn  F&eacute;in representative to use. It has historical significance rather than current  significance.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member picks up what has been proposed in the social  fund. In my conversations with Lord Freud, I have made it very clear that the  proposal in England, Wales and Scotland to administer the social  fund through councils is not a model that we should employ here. The powers,  character and nature of our council and local government framework are  different to those in Britain.  We should have the ability to continue to deliver the social fund in a way that  is fit for purpose rather than create new architecture through councils that  have not had that function for a long period.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, the model and mechanism being proposed in Britain are not  what we want to see here. I am not often tempted to guess when it comes to the  intentions of the British Government, but if I were to do so, I would say that  we will win the argument about the delivery mechanism in Northern Ireland when it comes to what the  proposed delivery mechanisms through local councils in Britain might  be.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">When it comes to the issue of staffing in social security  offices, I am anxious. I have said, and I will say again now, that Social  Security Agency front line staff are part of the family of front line staff. If  there is going to be a situation in which there are increasing numbers of  unemployed people, we need to have sufficient numbers of front-facing staff in  our social security offices to do the work. If there are cuts to the number of  front line staff or disproportionate cuts to the Social Security Agency and its  budget, there will be people in need coming into social security offices and  not enough staff to help them to access benefits and to answer their questions.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That leads me to the wider point: those who work in  neighbourhood renewal, housing, CMED, social security, nursing, teaching and  other professions are all front line people who must be protected in the Budget  outcomes.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I heard what the Member said about training. I will provide  him with a written answer that will give him the details of the conversations  that we have had with the new head of the Social Security Agency, Mr O&rsquo;Reilly,  about further training to ensure that staff are fully tuned into the management  of benefits.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As I indicated earlier, training and guidance are ways of  ensuring that people who go to the agency get all the benefits to which they  are entitled, instead of losing out and having to go through an appeal.  Therefore, training, as a strategy to address need and to help people to  maximise their benefit entitlement, is one way of dealing with the developing  situation on welfare reform and benefit cuts.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>:  Following that train of thought, I had the opportunity last week to visit the  fraud department in DSD. One of the interesting statistics that I was told  during my visit was that 83,000 errors in the system are investigated by that  department annually. Does that not indicate to the Minister that there is a  need for additional training, or maybe retraining, of some employees in the  Department?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister said that it would be thoughtless folly to  ignore parity completely. He well knows my opinions on some of the reforms. I  think that the reforms are counterproductive in some respects. However, even  thinking through the reduction on mortgage interest rate relief, does the  Minister agree that breaking parity on that issue would involve not just making  up the extra fund from the interest that was reduced? Does the Minister accept  that we would be handing the Tory-led Government the opportunity to do away  with all mortgage relief payments, which would leave the Executive in a  completely invidious situation?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for his questions. It is very useful  when Members bear down on particular issues across the field of ministerial  responsibility. That is why the persistent questions from the Member on the  issue of fraud and error in the Social Security Agency are very useful  interventions in ensuring that where there are opportunities to do more in  respect of fraud or error, we take them.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am not aware of the figure of 83,000, but my intuition  tells me that those 83,000 errors are not all staff errors. There are  categories of error way beyond the responsibility and control of social  security staff. Many of those errors will arise from customers giving information  that is inaccurate and incomplete and that needs to be checked. My intuition  tells me that the balance of error may significantly not be the responsibility  of social security staff.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As I indicated to Mr Boylan, if any fine-tuning of training  is required with regard to staff error, Members can rest assured that the  Department, the Social Security Agency and I will address that. Critically, if  more interventions in training are needed to ensure that our staff manage the  system with due process and good evidence to ensure that people get all the  benefits they are entitled to, we will do that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I made it clear that we should not rush into the issue of  parity with regard to mortgage interest support. As I indicated, I would not  necessarily rely on the British Government and not take the opportunity to open  issues in a way that we are not prepared for, have not scoped out fully, have  not assessed the impact of completely and in a way that only puts those in need  in greater need. However, we should be robust and exhaustive in our  conversation with London  about mortgage interest support and in our conversation in the Executive to  identify whether there is anything that we can do. Let us remember that people  are, as I understand it, entitled to that scheme for only two years. After the  two years are up, which will begin to happen in January 2011 for claimants in Northern Ireland,  they will not get mortgage support for up to 39 weeks after they go onto  jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That is why I am taking forward particular work on mortgage  arrears and repossessions. I want to acknowledge a very useful paper that was  provided to me in October by Advice Northern Ireland and a letter that I  received from the organisation in early November that encouraged me and the  Department to go in certain directions. Arising from that information, I issued  instructions that the Department should go in certain directions to deal with  the issue of people in mortgage arrears and at risk of repossession, a  situation that I think will become more acute.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I apologise to the Minister for having to nip out and miss part of his  statement. He said that he agreed with some of the principles of the reforms  set out by the coalition, namely that work is a positive and contributes much.  Does he agree that the current system, with over 30-something benefits, is very  complex and that we have to change? When breaking with any of the parity  principles, is there not a huge danger for the Budget terms as we know them?  When he breaks parity on any issue, there is a huge risk to the block grant.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I agree with the Member: there is no doubt that welfare  benefits are far too complex and simplification is needed. I do not think that  there is any dispute among any party about that. There was no dispute in any  responses to a recent welfare consultation from people involved in giving advice.  The advice was that the system needs to be simplified and less complex. I  completely concur with that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The danger is that although universal credit may simplify  the system, in the meantime, London  is driving down the welfare baseline so that, under the guise of reform, we  actually have the impact of benefit cuts.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Over the next two or three years, as the cost of rolling  out universal credit becomes more obvious, as the complexity becomes clearer  and the difficulties become more certain, I am worried that the London  Government will decide that the only way in which they can fund it is to make  further benefit cuts. Therefore, whatever about the two phases of the benefit  cuts, I am worried that, in 2013, we will discover that the up-front costs of welfare  reform are so extravagant and the proposal so complicated that more money will  have to be put into it, and welfare reform will need to be funded from a third  phase of benefit cuts. I do not discount that possibility.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I repeat that we should stretch parity, we should challenge  it, and we should try to find ways of going around and through it. In the  longer term, we need to scope the whole issue of parity. Where we are unable to  break parity or mitigate the consequences of it in our own legislation, DSD and  the Executive may find reason and good grounds to intervene to mitigate the  consequences of what parity might mean for law and policy in the North. That is  how I will deal with parity. I will not rush in here and tell Members that now  is the time to break parity fundamentally and substantially, because that is  how people in need will be put in greater need, and it will create an  opportunity for the British Government to say that if we want to breach parity,  we can live with the consequences. However, if those consequences are not  properly thought through, there will be a disproportionate impact on too many  people in Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Members will be aware that we normally suspend at 12.30 pm, which  is when the Business Committee meets. However, there are a substantial number  of questions remaining, so we will continue. I ask Members and the Minister to  keep focused. We will continue the one hour of questions to the Minister.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement, which was very thoughtful and robust in  the defence of people here. I wish the Minister well in his discussions with  the Minister for Work and Pensions, his Ministers of State and Parliamentary  Under-Secretaries of State. However, is there not a danger that, although they  may be well-intentioned, or at least Iain Duncan Smith may be well-intentioned,  the more ideologically minded Ministers at the Treasury will interfere with any  flexibility that Iain Duncan Smith might wish to give to Northern Ireland?  I wish the Minister well in his discussions, but I would like him to comment on  that.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for his question. I have been  particular in acknowledging that there are those in the Government who have  better intentions when it comes to welfare reform. However, the Member is right  on the issue of flexibility and on the issue of management of benefits  generally. Too often, Treasury interests prevail, and Treasury interests are to  cut money and to be dogmatic about the issue of benefit and welfare generally.  Therefore, I completely agree.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As I said in my statement, the London Government ultimately have a  fundamental choice to make. They say that they acknowledge the high levels of  deprivation, compounded by a legacy of conflict and the potential for  instability. If one accepts that those are the circumstances in Northern  Ireland and that the same circumstances do not exist in Britain, even though  there are areas in Britain that have equivalent deprivation levels to those in  Northern Ireland, one has to live with the consequences of accepting that  analysis. Iain Duncan Smith accepts that argument. Indeed, the organisation  that he was formerly president of published a report in the late summer making  all those arguments.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The consequences should mean that Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  particular circumstances are recognised in either financial or operational  terms, with regard to how we manage welfare reform, or by conducting welfare  reform in the image of our circumstances.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If the London Government do not draw that conclusion, I do  not believe that they &mdash; I want to be cautious here &mdash; are being fair to the  people of Northern Ireland.  Ultimately, whatever Iain Duncan Smith and the Treasury say, if those  circumstances are right, the political leadership of the British Government,  the Prime Minister and Nick Clegg, should say that they are right and should  act in a way that is consistent with them.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Anderson</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement. I have a couple of brief questions. The  Minister referred to cuts of &pound;500 million. Will he give the House, in round  figures, the total number of people on low incomes who will be adversely hit by  those cuts? The Minister will be aware that in certain areas, such as my constituency,  deprivation often occurs in a number of small pockets. How will he prioritise  those areas in his response to the current situation?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for his question. I may provide him  with more details in a written reply. In my statement, I tried to break down  all the changes and cuts to welfare benefits and how they read across to Northern Ireland  with regard to the number of people who will be affected. I understand that  7,500 people will be disadvantaged by the impact of the reduction in support  for mortgage interest to 3&middot;63%. That is 7,500 out of 15,000 people who receive  that support. The Department is trying to fine-tune that figure to make it more  precise, but, as I understand it, it is around 7,500.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Just over 1,000 people will be affected by the change to  baby tax credit; 1,068 people, I believe. Statistics show that 454 households  will be affected by local housing allowance monetary caps. Around 7,200  households will be affected by the removal of the excess payment of &pound;15. The  change to set the rate so that it is consistent with rents in the thirtieth  percentile will affect 38,000 people who are in receipt of housing benefit.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Those figures demonstrate the scale of the number of people  who will be affected by those changes: it will be measured in tens of thousands.  Some people will be affected by single changes; others by multiple changes.  Tens of thousands of people will be affected. That figure relates to people who  are in receipt of benefits, such as housing benefit. All of that will be  compounded by growth in the number of people who are unemployed, which,  unfortunately, could also be measured in tens of thousands.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms M Anderson</strong>: Go raibh  m&iacute;le maith agat. I apologise to the Minister for not being in the Chamber for  the entire duration of his statement. He was, probably, both correct and  incorrect in his comments about escape. I have thought about escaping from  other places. I have also thought about escaping from the Chamber, so that I  could get out to my constituency to attend to what, at times, I have thought to  be more valuable work.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to ask the Minister about a part of his statement  that I heard. I am interested in research that his Department is conducting in  order to deal with the consequences of the coming changes. As part of that  work, will the Minister consider taking on board our experience in the  regeneration plan for the city of Derry?  We discovered that data is not being collected on a section 75 basis by the  Department for Social Development and by other Departments. Minister, your  Department is not the only Department not to do so. I am conscious of the fact  that you and your predecessor inherited the situation, so please do not think  that I am in any way saying that the situation is of your making or doing.  Section 75 data is collected in your Department, but it is not collated in a  way that is categorised. I think that collecting and collating such data would  enable you, for instance, to inform us further about the 38,000 people who you  said would be affected by housing benefit. Who are they? Are they disabled?  Where do they live? We cannot get access to that information.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member get to her question, please?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms M Anderson</strong>: Will the  Minister look at his Department to see what is being done about the collection  and collation of section 75 data, so as to enable us to target proposals in a  more robust way? I have asked other Ministers to do likewise.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: There is a need for immediate short-term research and  assessments on the profile of all that London is  proposing and on what the immediate and medium-term impacts will be on the  people of Northern Ireland.  We need to bear down on that piece of work to know precisely the number of  people who are at risk and the financial consequences for each of them, and how  the proposals, however well-intentioned by London,  might be having some detrimental and prejudicial impact on people and families  in Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Professor Harrington will do some important work, and  Queen&rsquo;s University has been commissioned to do some as well. I am also seeking  advice from the people I named earlier, particularly Professor Eileen Evason.  We need to have the information and evidence base in order to plan how to  mitigate the impacts. It will enable me, among other things, to go to my  Executive colleagues to present a remedies paper and a suggested platform that  are not airy-fairy or made up on my way into the office. It is important that  plans are evidence-based and will target those most in need.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In that regard, I sat with staff yesterday and instructed  them to scope, for instance, the potential for focusing benefit take-up  campaigns on particular groups. That would be done on a without-prejudice  basis, because no decision has been taken on this. Therefore, if 7,500 people  will be adversely affected by the change in mortgage interest support, will we  know who they are? Could we target them in a potential benefit take-up campaign  to maximise their access to benefits as part of a mortgage intervention  approach to deal with issues of need?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I listened carefully to what the Member said about the  collection and non-collation of section 75 data. I will look at that to see  whether there is something in it that we could reasonably extract that could,  usefully, help that research and evidence base.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement. He made an interesting point in his  response to Martina Anderson. He said that if the Department has the data, it  would almost approach the people, rather than the other way round, in which  people have to apply for benefits on an individual basis. This is a different  way of doing things. Is the Minister minded to look at how benefits are taken  up and in having that type of one-stop shop approach? Throughout his statement,  the Minister commented on DEL  and on advice services. How will advice services be protected in any Budget  review? Will welfare reform be part of the ongoing discussions with the Budget  review team, and with the DEL Minister, in particular?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: Benefit take-up has always been important, but it will  become crucial. To some degree, London  recognises that there is a higher level of benefit take-up in Northern Ireland.  One reason for that is that there have been a number of benefit take-up  interventions by the Social Security Agency and other organisations, including  some interventions on a targeted basis, to enable people to maximise their  benefits. Therefore our benefit take-up profile is in part influenced by the  fact that we have benefit take-up campaigns.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">12.45 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The work of Advice Northern Ireland, Citizens Advice and the  Law Centre &mdash; all of which are funded by DSD &mdash; and the other work undertaken by  the SSA on benefit take-up is very important. I brought those organisations in  for a meeting about five weeks ago and had a conversation with them about the  continued and potentially critical role that they will play. I will not make  commitments about what funding might be available for the advice network in Northern  Ireland ahead of the conclusions of the Budget discussions, but I told them  that day, and I do not mind sharing it with Members, that the funding of advice  services is part of the intervention to protect people in need.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As I told Ms Anderson, reworking and developing benefit  take-up campaigns to visit those in particular stress &mdash; potentially, for  example, those in mortgage stress, not least because of mortgage interest  support changes &mdash; will be a crucial aspect of Government policy over the next four  or five years.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Does the Minister agree that the  complex and technical changes that he outlined, particularly to disability  allowance and incapacity benefit, amount to an ideological assault on  vulnerable disabled people?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: There are streams of ideological thinking in what the  Treasury in particular has done and in some of the comments, both public and  private, that I have heard from British Government Ministers. I agree that  there is an ideological hand in much of what is happening, and although some  are acting from the best intentions, as they see it, I believe that they will  have some of the worst outcomes. However, when British Government Ministers and  people in the Tory Party are saying that getting people out the door for a  four-week training programme is the way to help them back into work, I think we  are seeing the shadow of Tebbit rather than the influence of those who are best  intentioned.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">When that issue broke in the media, a local programme  covered it extensively. Seamus McAleavey from NICVA said that, in Northern Ireland,  getting people out to work for four weeks when there is already a deep volunteering  tradition seems to be in tension with local circumstances. Professor Eileen  Evason added:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The problem with the whole exercise is that it is a  waste of time, but, as everybody knows, there isn&rsquo;t the work out there.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has arranged to meet upon the lunchtime  suspension. I propose, therefore, by leave of the Assembly, to suspend the  sitting until 2.00 pm.</p>

      <p class="H4StageHeading">Assembly Members (Independent Financial Review and  Standards) Bill: Second Stage</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  beg to move</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That the Second Stage of the Assembly Members  (Independent Financial Review and Standards) Bill [NIA 3/10] be agreed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased to present the Bill on behalf of the Assembly  Commission. Financial support for Members of the Assembly and for Members of  other legislatures has been the focus of increased public and media scrutiny in  recent years. A high level of criticism has been levelled at the lack of  independence in the process for determining Members&rsquo; salaries, allowances and  pensions. By bringing forward this Bill, the Assembly seeks to establish a  wholly independent process for the determination of future financial support  requirements for MLAs.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill is in two parts, so it is effectively two Bills  cobbled together. Part 1 will establish the independent financial review panel,  and Part 2 will establish the Northern    Ireland Assembly Commissioner for Standards.  I will present the general principles of Part 1, and the Chairperson of the  Committee on Standards and Privileges, Mr Declan O&rsquo;Loan, will discuss the  general principles of Part 2.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I begin with an outline to the background of Part 1. The  argument has been made that Members in the first mandate should have grasped a  lot of the issues in question, so it may be said that we are coming to this  matter later than we should have. Nevertheless, I will set out the background  to where we have reached.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">On 4 May 2007, prior to the restoration of devolution, the  Secretary of State wrote to the chairman of the Senior Salaries Review Body  (SSRB) seeking its agreement to conduct a review of the existing structures for  salaries, expenditure and pensions benefits payable to Members and office  holders of the Northern Ireland Assembly. The SSRB completed its report in  November 2008 and recommended that the Northern Ireland Assembly should commit  to accepting the outcome of future independent reviews of salaries, allowances  and pensions without modification, thereby respecting the impartiality of the  external review process. That reflected Members&rsquo; desire to be distanced from  deciding their own salaries and financial support arrangements. Indeed, in  joint meetings between the Assembly Commission and party leaders, there was  consensus that a move to establish an independent body in line with other  legislatures would be a positive step towards greater openness and transparency  in this area.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">After considering the SSRB report, the Assembly Commission  supported the recommendation that consideration should be given to the  establishment of an independent mechanism for the future determination of  salaries, pensions and financial support for Members. To take that forward, the  Assembly Commission recommended that an amendment to the Northern Ireland Act  1998 should be made to enable the Northern Ireland Assembly to delegate, in its  entirety, the function of determining salaries, pensions and financial support  to an independent statutory body. The legal framework for determining and  paying salaries, allowances, pensions and gratuities is governed by sections 47  and 48 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Section 48 allows for provision for the payment of  pensions, gratuities and allowances to former Members or office holders to be  delegated by the Northern Ireland Assembly. However, until recently, section  47, which governs the determination and payment of Members&rsquo; salaries and  allowances, explicitly prevented the Assembly from delegating the function of  making a determination.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Northern Ireland Assembly Members Act 2010, which  received Royal Assent on 8 April 2010, amended sections 47 and 48 of the Northern  Ireland Act 1998 and allows the Assembly to continue to determine salaries and  allowances of Members or to delegate that function to an independent body. The  Assembly Commission recommended in its &lsquo;Report on the Financial Support and  Pensions for Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly&rsquo;, dated 22 June 2010,  that a Bill should be brought forward to establish an independent statutory  body. The Bill proposes the establishment of such a body, namely the  independent financial review panel.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly Commission launched a public consultation on 1  June 2010, inviting comments on the establishment of an independent body and on  the functions, objectives, governance and budget arrangements of that body. The  Commission also conducted an equality screening exercise on the proposal, and  that exercise did not reveal any significant differential impact on any of the  groups set out in section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Members may be aware that a similar independent body, the  National Assembly for Wales Remuneration Board, has been established in Wales by the National Assembly for Wales  (Remuneration) Measure 2010. England  has the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA), which was  established by the Parliamentary Standards Act 2009. Although we are taking  this action today, others may be a little bit ahead of us, but the time frame  has been relatively similar.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will explain the general principles of Part 1 of the  Bill. The Bill will establish the independent financial review panel, known as  the panel. It will consist of a chairperson and two other members, and it will  have the power to determine all aspects of financial support to Members of the  Northern Ireland Assembly. That means that the panel will determine the  salaries and allowances payable to Members of the Assembly under section 47 of  the Northern Ireland Act 1998 and the pensions, gratuities and allowances  payable to former Members and office holders under section 48 of that Act. The  Assembly Commission will retain the administration of salaries and expenditure.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The panel will be required to exercise its functions with a  view to achieving a proper balance between the objective of ensuring probity,  accountability and value for money in the expenditure of public funds and the  objective of securing an adequate level of remuneration for Members that allows  them to discharge their functions effectively. The general rule will be that a  determination will be made by the panel only once in the lifetime of each  Assembly. Further determinations may be made as necessary to take account of  changes in the law and practice relating to pensions or exceptional  circumstances. Unless there are such changes or circumstances, there will not  be a determination where there is less than a year between an ordinary general  Assembly election and an extraordinary Assembly election.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The panel will be required, so far as is reasonably  practical, to make its determination before the election of the Assembly to  which the determination relates, although a determination will survive until a  new one is made to replace it. That will allow candidates and, perhaps more  importantly, the electorate to know in advance of an election what financial  support will be available to an elected candidate. The panel must communicate  the determination to the Assembly Commission as soon as is reasonably practical  after it has been made, and the Commission must publish the determination in  full. It is important to realise that the Commission cannot amend the  determination.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">To ensure the independence of the panel, the Bill provides  that the panel will not be subject to the direction or control of the Northern  Ireland Assembly when exercising its functions. The Assembly Commission will be  responsible for the appointment of panel members, but Members of the Northern  Ireland Assembly will not be members of the appointment panel. In addition, to  ensure that the panel is independent of Members, a broad range of connections  to the Assembly or individual Members will result in disqualification. I suspect  that Members will want to scrutinise that closely in Committee to ensure that  the balance is right.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">To ensure that the panel operates as cost-effectively as  possible, schedule 2 to the Bill states that the Assembly Commission must:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;provide the Panel, or ensure that the Panel is  provided, with such administrative support, including staff, services and  accommodation, as the Panel may reasonably require to enable it to discharge  its functions.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly Commission, however, is obliged to consult the  panel about such support in order to ensure that such provision, particularly  the duties of the staff of the Assembly and the separation of the panel&rsquo;s work  from the business of the Northern Ireland Assembly or the Commission, does not  call into question the panel&rsquo;s independence.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I look forward to other Members&rsquo; contributions to the  debate.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee on Standards and Privileges (Mr O&rsquo;Loan)</strong>: I will speak as  the Chairperson of the Committee on Standards and Privileges, but, before doing  so, speaking on behalf of my party, I give full support to Part 1 of the Bill  and its creation of an independent financial review panel.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Peter Weir has just explained, on behalf of the Assembly  Commission, the principles behind the creation of an independent panel in Part  1. As Chairman of the Committee, I will explain the principles behind the  creation of an independent Commissioner for Standards, which is provided for in  Part 2.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">All of us in the House should share the vision of building  an Assembly that strengthens democracy and engages the people of Northern Ireland  in creating a better future for all. It is vital to the proper functioning of  our democracy that there be public confidence in the integrity of us as Members  and in the Assembly as an institution. That does not mean that the public  should always agree with everything that all of us say or do. That is just not  how democracies work. In a Chamber such as this, in which all sections of  society have a voice, there will inevitably be differences of opinion. There  are opposing views, conflicting priorities and competing ideologies. Sometimes  we can agree issues very easily, but sometimes we need robust and challenging  debate, and compromises need to be made to allow us to take difficult decisions  and reach agreement. We should recognise that the reality of the process does  not always inspire public acclaim.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">What is more important, however, is that when we propose  policies, scrutinise Departments, question Ministers, debate among ourselves  and take decisions, it is understood and accepted by the public that we do so  solely and exclusively to serve the public interest, not personal or private  interests. It would be completely unacceptable &mdash; indeed, it would damage the  very fabric of our democracy &mdash; if Members were to use the Assembly to pursue  outside interests. That is why we have such strict rules on Members&rsquo; interests.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly&rsquo;s code of conduct provides a transparent  system to ensure that Members place the public interest ahead of their private  interests. The code of conduct maintains the integrity of the Assembly by  requiring Members to adhere to high ethical standards. It enshrines the seven  principles of public life at the heart of what we do and sets out clearly the  rules that we must follow. In doing so, it upholds public confidence. Of  course, that confidence would soon be undermined if Members were not  accountable for their conduct under the code. That is where having a powerful  and independent Commissioner for Standards comes in. Where there are  allegations that a Member may have breached the code of conduct, they must be  investigated and the outcome of that investigation must be made known.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly has had, for a number of years, an interim  arrangement to ensure that any such allegations would be independently  investigated. A previous Committee on Standards and Privileges concluded that  the office of the Assembly Ombudsman was well placed and equipped to discharge  the functions of the commissioner on an interim basis. It is appropriate that,  as we debate the Bill&rsquo;s principles today, we should acknowledge and recognise  the work that the Ombudsman has done as the Interim Assembly Commissioner for  Standards.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Tom Frawley and his assistant, John MacQuarrie, have been  the Committee&rsquo;s dedicated servants. They have had to investigate and consider  many thorny issues. It is right, therefore, that the public record reflects the  Assembly&rsquo;s gratitude for their ongoing service.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is high time that the Assembly put in place formal  arrangements for its Commissioner for Standards. Therefore, in June, the  Assembly debated the Committee&rsquo;s report on enforcing the code of conduct and  appointing an Assembly Commissioner for Standards. The report followed an  extensive inquiry by the Committee, the aim of which was to establish the most  appropriate means of maintaining the Assembly&rsquo;s code of conduct and handling  alleged breaches of it. In its report, the Committee concluded, and the  Assembly agreed, that, broadly speaking, the principles of the existing system,  whereby the Assembly regulates its own affairs and takes decisions on complaints  against Members, were appropriate, reasonable and workable. However, it was  also recognised that, although those principles were sound, important work  could and should be done to ensure that, in practice, the system is more robust  and is seen to be fairer and more transparent. Most significantly, it was  agreed that the Assembly should have its own statutory Commissioner for  Standards.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As in the interim arrangements, the com&shy;missioner&rsquo;s role  will be to carry out independent investigations into complaints against Members  and to present his or her findings to the Committee on Standards and  Privileges. However, it was agreed that, in support of that role, the  commissioner&rsquo;s powers should be set out in statute. What is more, it was agreed  that the commissioner&rsquo;s independence from the Assembly in respect of specific  investigations should be set out in legislation. The Assembly agreed. It also  agreed that, for a one-off term of appointment, there should be a fair and open  competition for the position of Assembly Commissioner for Standards.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Part 2 makes provision for a Northern Ireland Assembly  Commissioner for Standards. The Bill provides for the commissioner to receive  and investigate complaints and other issues concerning Members, to initiate  investigations and to report outcomes to the Assembly. It is particularly  important that the commissioner be able to initiate investigations when he or  she believes that the code of conduct may have been breached but when no  complaint has been made. Sir Christopher Kelly, from the Committee on Standards  in Public Life, pointed out that it is difficult for the public to have  confidence in a commissioner who cannot respond to serious allegations because  no complaint has been made. There was no clearer example of that than during the  expenses scandal at Westminster,  when evident abuses were identified but the Parliamentary Commissioner for  Standards was powerless to act without a formal complaint. The Assembly is the  first legislature in these islands to agree that a commissioner should be able  to initiate investigations, and I am pleased to note that, having had time to  consider our report on the matter, the House of Commons Committee on Standards  and Privileges has come to the same conclusion.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill also provides for the commissioner&rsquo;s independence  and freedom from the direction and control of the Assembly. It is important to  recall what the Assembly agreed about the commissioner&rsquo;s independence. It is  not the case that the Committee on Standards and Privileges should have no role  in how the commissioner carries out his or her functions. For example, the  Committee should be able to agree the protocols and procedures that the  commissioner should apply generally to all cases. To an extent, those protocols  are already set out in the Assembly&rsquo;s code of conduct, and it is right that the  commissioner should take a consistent approach to considering admissibility and  carrying out investigations. It is also appropriate that, having received a  report from the commissioner on a specific complaint, the Committee should be  able to ask the commissioner to go back and establish or clarify particular  points.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">When we talk about the commissioner&rsquo;s independence, we mean  that, subject to any general admissibility criteria, the commissioner must be  free to carry out an investigation into a Member if the commissioner believes  that an investigation is appropriate. Furthermore, once the commissioner has  decided to carry out a specific investigation, he or she must be able to carry  it out as he or she sees fit within the agreed framework. Most importantly of  all, the commissioner must be free to reach and express any particular  conclusions on the outcome of any investigation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly has agreed that, in support of those important  principles and to promote transparency, the Committee on Standards and  Privileges will always publish in full any reports of the commissioner in its  own reports to the Assembly. In that way, the commissioner&rsquo;s independence will  be safeguarded, and his or her findings will always be a matter of public  record. I am pleased that the Bill provides for each of those principles, and,  in doing so, it upholds the commissioner&rsquo;s independence.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill also gives the commissioner important powers. Most  significantly, the commissioner will have the independent power to call for  witnesses and documents. The Bill also creates a number of offences that relate  to refusals to provide, or otherwise failing, to give evidence in accordance  with a request by the commissioner. Those provisions will give the commissioner  the ability to establish the full facts during any investigation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased that the Assembly Commission has indicated  that it will provide the necessary resources for the commissioner. Of course,  at this time, we are more mindful than ever of the need to use our resources  prudently. We should, therefore, be clear that Part 2 of the Bill is not about  creating a whole new office with significant running costs. It is about putting  in place improved arrangements and greater powers for a function that is  already carried out and funded by the public purse. The predicted annual running  costs of the new commissioner are estimated to be up to &pound;25,000, but they may  well be less. That amount is broadly comparable with the cost of the current  arrangements. I hope that we can all agree that that is a small amount to pay  to ensure the open and transparent accountability of Members.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Part 2 of the Bill provides a legislative framework that  will strengthen the public&rsquo;s trust in the integrity of the Assembly. It has  been agreed unanimously by the Committee on Standards and Privileges, and it  signifies how seriously the Assembly takes the issue of the conduct of its  Members. I welcome the provisions of the Bill and commend them to the House.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I will speak about Part 2 of the  Bill. There is a consensus in the Committee on Standards and Privileges and in  the Assembly that we, as public representatives, must be able to show  leadership and demonstrate that we are capable of taking responsibility for  having an effective means of holding one another to account.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">For a number of years, the Assembly has had in place an  interim arrangement to ensure that any such allegations would be independently  investigated. I thank the Interim Assembly Commissioner for Standards, Mr Tom  Frawley, and Mr John McQuarrie. For a number of years, they assisted the  Committee with what can appear, at times, to be a thankless task. Let me assure  them that the Committee, as the Chairperson said, is grateful for their  diligence and professionalism.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly discussed the policy proposals in relation to  the post of Assembly Commissioner for Standards when it debated the Committee&rsquo;s  report last June. That report followed a wide-ranging Committee inquiry, the  aim of which was to establish the most suitable way of maintaining the  Assembly&rsquo;s code of conduct and handling alleged breaches of it. We all want to  strengthen our democracy, and it is imperative to our democracy that there is  public confidence in our honesty as Members and in the Assembly as an  institution. The Bill will help us to repair the enormous damage to the  credibility of politicians that occurred following the Westminster scandals. Politicians&rsquo; names were  mud after what went on there, and there was a perception among the general  public that every politician was on the gravy train. I want to put on record  that I believe that every Member of the Assembly works for the benefit of all  the people.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We must obtain the public&rsquo;s trust again, and our new code  of conduct endeavours to do that. As we are talking about standards in public  life, it is right and appropriate that the commissioner should be appointed by  means of an open and transparent competition that is consistent with the  principles of best practice. That is set out very well in schedule 3 to the  Bill, which contains a lengthy list of persons who are disqualified from being  appointed, or from serving, as the commissioner. The Bill team and the  Committee did a lot of work on that important aspect of the Bill.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is very important that the commissioner will be able to  initiate investigations where he or she believes that a breach of the code of  conduct may have occurred but where no complaint has been made. There is no  clearer example of that, as has already been mentioned, than during the  expenses scandal at Westminster.  There was no mechanism in place for the commissioner to conduct an  investigation. Everybody knew that a significant number of MPs were engaging in  serious wrongdoings, and, basically, the system failed the taxpayer. I am glad  that Westminster  is following the Assembly&rsquo;s lead.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill also provides for the commissioner&rsquo;s independence  and freedom from the direction and control of the Assembly. Furthermore, it  gives the commissioner important powers, mainly that the commissioner will have  the independent power to call for witnesses and documents in a similar way to  the Standards and Privileges Committee.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The predicted annual running costs of &pound;25,000 have been  touched upon. That is in line with what is paid to the interim commissioner at  present. That provides value for money, and I hope that it allows us to  continue the good work in an open, transparent and accountable way for elected  representatives.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, the Bill provides a parliamentary structure  that will build up public trust in the honour of the Assembly. It has been  endorsed collectively by the Committee on Standards and Privileges and  signifies that the Assembly takes its Members&rsquo; conduct very seriously. I  welcome the Bill and commend it to the House.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I call the Rev Dr Bob Coulter. Dr Coulter, if you are still  speaking at 2.30 pm, I will have to interrupt to begin Question Time.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Robert Coulter</strong>:  The sermon will be short then.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Involvement in public life should, in some sense, be a  calling and not simply a paid occupation. That is why I believe that only the  highest standards of conduct from public representatives are acceptable,  especially in matters of finance, expenses and the conduct of public life.  Although some MPs abused the system in Westminster,  many public representatives simply operated the system that was in place,  largely without question. It is easy to see why that happened. The system was  clearly inadequate to ensure the high standards expected by the electorate of  their public representatives. That is precisely why a robust system has to be  in place. The Bill seeks to ensure that. We must give it our support, because  clarity, which the Bill provides, is in the interest of everyone, including  Members, the public and those who administer the system.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">When he was Lord Protector, Oliver Cromwell told his  Parliament repeatedly that he had too much power and asked it repeatedly to  make him &ldquo;more bounded than I am&rdquo;. Assembly Members should take note of that  sound advice. There is a need to be above suspicion when determining salaries  or when adjudicating on the conduct a Member, and that is why independent  bodies are so important to ensure that MLAs demonstrate a willingness to bring  themselves under a set of standards and rules of remuneration and a code of  conduct that is clear and visible to all.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Transparency has to be the watchword of all public life,  all public conduct and all public representatives. The public expects the level  of scrutiny and the mechanism to control the controversial issues of pay and  conduct that the Bill lays before the House today. To do that job convincingly  and adequately, the Standards Commissioner has to have access to the powers  that are prescribed in the Bill. How can anyone fear clarity? Why should anyone  fear clarity? Let us vote today for clarity, certainty and probity. Let us show  the people whom we represent that we mean business. I commend the measures to  the House.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Members should take their ease for a few seconds. At 2.30 pm, we  will begin questions to the Minister of Education. We will return to the debate  after Question Time, when Mr Peter Weir will make a winding-up speech.</p>

      <p class="OralAnswers-H2DepartmentHeading">Education</p>
      <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Faith-based Education</p>
      <p class="OralAnswers-Question">1. <strong>Mr P  Ramsey </strong>asked the Minister of Education to outline her Department&rsquo;s position  in relation to the right of parents to opt for faith-based education for their  children. (AQO 574/11<a name="AQO57411"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education (Ms Ruane)</strong>: Is prionsabal l&aacute;rnach den reachta&iacute;ocht oideachais &iacute;  oideachas a chur ar f&aacute;il do dhalta&iacute; de r&eacute;ir mhianta a dtuismitheoir&iacute; in gach  c&aacute;s inar f&eacute;idir.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is a central principle in education legislation that,  where possible, pupils must be educated in accordance with the wishes of their  parents. We have a diversity of school types and sectors in the North of  Ireland, each with its own distinctive character. Since coming into office, I  have actively supported policies that encourage and support collaboration and  integrating between sectors.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The promotion of equality and respect for diversity are  long established in education legislation. They are reflected in the rights of  churches to establish and own schools and in the duties on my Department to  encourage and facilitate Irish-medium and integrated education. Those  legislative principles continue to be reflected in the Executive&rsquo;s policy on  the review of public administration and in the Education Bill, with the  creation of a single education and skills authority (ESA) to support all  sectors. I hope that the Bill will return to the Assembly as soon as possible.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her reply. Can she outline the contribution that  faith-based education sectors across Northern Ireland make, and can she  give a commitment to allow and guarantee parental choice over the sector that  parents want their children to attend?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: The evidence shows that ethos, whether Catholic, controlled,  Irish-medium or integrated, is important and that successful schools are those  with an ethos that pupils, parents, staff and governors support. That is why my  school improvement policy, Every School a Good School,  identifies the importance of having an ethos of aspiration and high expectation  for pupils. That makes a real difference, particularly for children from our  most disadvantaged areas. As Minister, I want to ensure that we support  diversity of provision and the rights of parents in an equality framework and  that we have an ethos of collaborating and integrating so that all our young  people are working and studying together.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Given the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to protecting the rights of parents, can she  explain whether she is being partial in that she denies the rights of parents  who wish to send their child to a grammar school? Were her proposals on ESA  damaging to Catholic education in that they would have taken away from Catholic  schools the rights that they have long had since they were established? How  does she marry those two blatant contradictions, which are only in keeping with  her many others?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Any choice needs to be based on equality. It is interesting to  hear the Member&rsquo;s party&rsquo;s new-found ideas on academic selection. I remind the  DUP of one of its sacred cows, and I can hear them shouting across already,  because they know that this is the case. The 1989 DUP election manifesto, which  is believed to have been written largely by Mr Robinson and was a platform on  which Mr Wilson stood, states:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;We believe that selection at 11 should be ended. The  11-plus procedure is educationally unsound and socially divisive and places  unnecessary strain upon children at a very early age.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Now, folks, I am being accused of hypocrisy? I rest  my case.<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.]</span></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order, please. I am sure that, in the lead up to Christmas, we  will want to reflect that in how we treat each other.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I am in the Christmas spirit, but, at the risk of getting the Minister&rsquo;s ire, I  am interested in the substance of the issue of choice. If one celebrates  diversity, people will be making a choice. What is the Minister&rsquo;s feeling on  the issue of choice? Should parents have the right to choose the most  appropriate school for their child?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Well, to my friend Basil, I believe that I answered the question  on choice. However, regardless of what choice parents make and regardless of  what schools we have in our system, I want to ensure that we have academic  excellence, vocational excellence and a world-class education system for all  our young people. That is the point that I was referring to earlier. We can  have a little joke about education, but there is no joke about standards and  ensuring that we have a world class education system that everybody gets access  to.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I call Mr Ian McCrea.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  Question number, um &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  Two.</p>
      <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Capital Works: Magherafelt</p>
      <p class="OralAnswers-Question">2. <strong>Mr I  McCrea </strong>asked the Minister of Education to outline progress on the capital  build projects being carried out in the Magherafelt area. &nbsp;(AQO 575/11<a name="AQO57511"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Are you sure? An bhfuil t&uacute; cinnte? Number 2?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Tugadh breis agus &pound;26 milli&uacute;n d&rsquo;infheist&iacute;ocht chaipitil le  foirgnimh nua scoile a shol&aacute;thar i gceantar Mhachaire F&iacute;olta do Woods Primary  School, do St Pius X High School, do Sperrin Integrated College agus do Spires  Integrated Primary School.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Capital investment of over &pound;26 million has been provided  for new school buildings in the Magherafelt area, at Woods  Primary School, St Pius X High School,  Sperrin Integrated  College and Spires Integrated   Primary School. In  addition, the construction of the new school building for Magherafelt High School  is under way. Work started in January 2010, and it is estimated that the  construction of the new school will be completed in November 2011.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">This morning, as the Member will be aware, I submitted a  written statement to the Assembly setting out concerns regarding the approvals  and procurement of that project. The chief executive of the board has reported  that the board has entered into an arrangement with the contractor involved,  which has resulted in construction works being undertaken without all the  necessary approvals being in place with the Department, and the board has made  payments, an element of which has not been approved by the Department. That is  a very serious matter, and I have, therefore, ordered an external investigation  of all the circumstances surrounding the procurement and work associated with  that contract. I expect to have the investigation report before Christmas, and  I will then judge what further steps are needed. I will, of course, update the  Assembly in due course. The Audit Office has been kept fully apprised of those  developments.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member will also be aware that, in June, I secured  additional capital funding, which permitted me to announce that 13 new school  building projects, including those for Magherafelt  Primary School and Magherafelt Nursery School,  should commence. Those two newbuilds in Magherafelt are scheduled to start in  January 2011.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I call Sir Reg Empey &mdash; sorry, I call Ian McCrea.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  There is a bit of confusion in the House today.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has referred to the number of new school  builds in the Magherafelt area and, indeed, the Mid Ulster constituency. She  also referred to her statement, and I await the outcome of that investigation  with interest, because there are concerns there.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister will not be surprised when I raise the issue  of the Rainey Endowed grammar school in Magherafelt, which I believe is  probably one of the high priorities within the board area but is outside the  board&rsquo;s responsibility.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question, Mr McCrea.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  Can the Minister assure the House that giving the school in Magherafelt a  newbuild is a priority for her Department?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: The scheme for a proposed new school building for Rainey Endowed  is included in my Department&rsquo;s investment delivery plan (IDP). The school is  moving to appoint a design team for the project. Following the recent review of  capital projects, Rainey   Endowed School  was deemed fully compliant. At present, there are 53 schemes remaining on the  Department&rsquo;s investment delivery plan. Obviously, my ability to move those and  other much-needed school building programmes forward is totally dependent on  the capital funds given to my Department.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Leanfaidh m&eacute; leis an stocaireacht chun cist&iacute; caipitil a  fh&aacute;il ionas gur f&eacute;idir lean&uacute;int de chl&aacute;r t&oacute;g&aacute;la na scoileanna.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will continue to lobby for capital funds to drive forward  the school building programme. I very much look forward to the British  Government adhering to the agreements made about the strategic investment  programme and the investment money that they agreed to allocate to this part of  Ireland.  Rainey Endowed School  will be considered for funding alongside the other projects remaining on the  IDP.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Sir Reg Empey</strong>:  Will the Minister enlighten the House on the progress being made on the capital  build project for Strathearn School in east Belfast?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Strathearn   School is one of the  schools that was given priority. I will send the Member an update on that.</p>
      <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Entitlement Framework</p>
      <p class="OralAnswers-Question">3. <strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan </strong>asked the Minister of Education for an update on the implementation of the  entitlement framework. (AQO 576/11<a name="AQO57611"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: T&aacute; cur i bhfeidhm ioml&aacute;n an chreata teidl&iacute;ochta faion bhliain  2013 f&oacute;s ina phr&iacute;omh-thosa&iacute;ocht ag mo Roinn.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The full implementation of the entitlement framework by  2013 remains a key priority for my Department. Although some progress has been  made in recent years, the pace of progress needs to be quickened if we are to  ensure that all young people, regardless of the sector or geographical area in  which they go to school, have equal opportunity to access a broad-based  curriculum by 2013. I firmly believe that through offering pupils access to a  wide range of courses that meet their interests, aptitudes and career aspirations,  we will ensure that many more young people can achieve their full potential.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Although almost all schools are members of area learning  communities, I remain to be convinced that they are all actively playing their  part, as they should be. There is nothing to fear from engaging with one other.  Barriers can be overcome, and issues such as timetabling can be resolved. The  area learning community is the forum where issues are brought, discussed and  resolved and where good practice is shared on an area basis. In many cases,  however, that collaboration is not happening as much it should be across the  classes, as opposed to across the various religions.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I want all schools and sectors to work together, because  they can deliver so much more for their pupils when they, along with the  further education colleges, pool their resources and share experiences and  expertise. I want schools to offer pupils a wide range of opportunities through  effective collaboration, because that often delivers better education experiences  for pupils and better value for money for taxpayers.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  thank the Minister and welcome the frankness of her answer. It confirms what  was stated in the recent Together Towards Entitlement report, which was that  achieving the entitlement framework across the schools in Northern Ireland  is well behind schedule. That ties in with the concept of area-based planning.  The Minister outlined that certain sectors are not moving forward with that.  Therefore, what can she do and what is she doing to ensure that that schedule  will be achieved?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I thank the Member for his interest in the area. It is essential  that all schools work together. One of the biggest policies that made a big  difference to the entitlement framework was the removal of the 11-plus, because  schools were in competition with one another rather than collaborating.  Thankfully, more and more schools are now working together.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the fact that a significant number of schools  have reached the target of providing 24 or 27 subjects. However, some are still  not playing their role. I have said clearly that my Department is monitoring  that. For example, we will not continue to fund a couple of courses in art and  science for four or five pupils in one town, because we cannot continue to pay  for the resources for teachers and pupils for a two-year period when those  pupils should be in one class in that area. My Department cannot continue to  fund on that basis, and we are telling area learning communities in those towns  and villages to get together, provide a broad-based curriculum and not  duplicate courses.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: Is  it the case that the Minister&rsquo;s Department will have failed to ensure that  there are 24 choices at Key Stage 4 and 27 choices at post-16 by September  2013? If so, does she agree that it would be highly regrettable if this were  not on target and ready for 2013?</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I welcome the progress that has been made. I look forward to  support from the Members opposite in bringing about that progress.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Members know about the jigsaw of interconnected reforms  that we have: the revised curriculum, which is a good curriculum; the  entitlement framework, which is very broad-based; area learning communities,  which are working together; and some good models of very good practice.  Lisanelly is one example of how we should shape the future of our education  system.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">All schools have to play their part. My Department is  working very closely with schools to do that. I hope that every Member in the  House is playing their role with their local schools, because we cannot have a  situation in which some schools are refusing to share facilities or to  timetable with other schools in their area. Often, that breaks down over class  not religion. It is up to everyone to play their role.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  The Minister touched on this matter, but I am not very clear about it. What is  the Department doing to mainstream good relations and shared education across  sectors through the development of the entitlement framework?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: People may be surprised at the extent of shared education. I  have been to schools across the North. Some places are more advanced than  others. However, having spoken to parents and young people, I know that more  and more pupils are doing one A level in one school, a second A level in another  school and a third A level in another school. More and more, as I visit our  post-primary schools, I see four or five different uniforms in classrooms, and  that is the way that it should be. I am driving integration and collaboration,  and I am encouraging and supporting area learning communities. That is the way  forward. Schools should not be competing with each other in an area, schools  should be working together.</p>
      <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Schools: North   Antrim</p>
      <p class="OralAnswers-Question">4. <strong>Mr Frew </strong>asked the Minister of Education which schools she has visited in the North  Antrim area since May 2007 and whether she intends to meet the staff and  governors of Castle   Tower School  to discuss the proposed new build. (AQO 577/11<a name="AQO57711"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: &Oacute; mh&iacute; Bealtaine 2007, thug m&eacute; cuairt ar roinnt scoileanna i  gceantar Aontroma Thuaidh le r&eacute;imse leathan de cheisteanna oideachais a phl&eacute;.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Since May 2007, I have visited a number of schools in the  north Antrim area, including Bunscoil an Chaistil, Garryduff Primary School,  Leaney Primary School, St Colmcille&rsquo;s Primary School, St Mary&rsquo;s Primary School,  Ballycastle Integrated Primary School, St Patrick&rsquo;s and St Brigid&rsquo;s Primary  School, Cross and Passion College, Our Lady of Lourdes High School and North  Coast Integrated College to discuss a wide variety of educational issues. In  addition, I have already met representatives from and visited Castle Tower   School. Therefore, I am  fully aware of the conditions under which the school is operating. However, due  to uncertainty over the resources available for future development, it is not  possible to provide a time frame on the way forward for such potential  projects.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am always keen to meet schools&rsquo; repre&shy;sentatives to  discuss issues directly. However, in this case, having already met  representatives and visited the school to discuss all the issues, I do not feel  that a meeting would add any benefit at this time.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to build schools. I have shown that, when resources  are available, I can deliver new schools. Since May 2007, the Department has  completed 49 major projects. I have visited two such projects yesterday and  today and two others in the past couple of weeks, all of which are in north  Antrim. We have spent &pound;422&middot;5 million on our schools estate. Seven further major  capital schools projects are on site, which is a further investment of &pound;89&middot;4  million.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The rate at which I can invest in the schools estate is  dependent upon the resources made available to me by the Executive. I urge  Members of the Assembly and, indeed, the Member from the party opposite to  support the case for providing adequate resources to continue with the  investment and school building programmes.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Frew</strong>: The  Minister will know the impossible position that Castle Tower   School is in, given that  it is one school but three campuses. What used to be three schools has been  left in an impossible situation. They were promised a newbuild, hence the name Castle Tower   School, as that newbuild  was to be situated near the old Ballymena castle. The school has been left in a  serious position. Will the Minister prioritise a newbuild for the school? She  can and she must act, as she did on behalf of Whitehouse Primary School,  which I commend. Will she act responsibly and immediately on this issue?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I thank the Member for his complimentary comments, and I take  them in the spirit in which they were made.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Aithn&iacute;onn mo Roinn go bhfuil saincheisteanna tromch&uacute;iseacha  c&oacute;ir&iacute;ochta ag Castle   Tower Special   School.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">My Department recognises that there are serious  accommodation issues at Castle   Tower School,  and I am particularly conscious that our most vulnerable children are being  educated in poor accommodation. I also fully appreciate that the difficulties,  particularly operating the school on a spilt-site campus, will be fully  alleviated only by the provision of a fit-for-purpose school building. The  scheme for Castle   Tower School  is one of a significant number that the Department supports, but for which the  funding has not yet been announced. As the Member will know, Whitehouse Primary School  was one of the schools on the list of capital projects.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">When the North Eastern Education and Library Board brought  forward a revised economic appraisal for the Castle Tower   School project in 2008,  it was accorded priority status by my Department, and it was reviewed and  scrutinised as a matter of urgency. I hope that the Members opposite and all  other Members in the House understand the importance of the capital budget  being protected and of the British Government adhering to the international  agreements to which they are party. I look forward to joining all parties in  the House in fighting our corner for more money for capital projects.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for her answer  and for her investment in north Antrim to date. In recent weeks, she visited  Portglenone and Ballycastle, where new capital build schools have been put in  place. I understand the frustration of parents, teachers and pupils from Castle Tower  School and from Braidside Integrated   School in Ballymena. It  is important, therefore, that we get the necessary resources for the capital  budget. How many capital building projects have been completed since the  Minister took office in May 2007?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Go raibh maith agat as an cheist sin. I must put on record the  wonderful visits that I made to St Mary&rsquo;s in Portglenone and to the new school  in Ballycastle.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If anyone wonders whether devolution is working, the answer  is yes, and one of the biggest pieces of evidence that I have for that is the  capital spend budget. I am sure that other Ministers will talk about their  Departments, but I will focus on mine. In the two years prior to my coming into  office, direct rule Ministers handed back &pound;62 million and &pound;94 million  respectively to the British Exchequer; I have not done that. Since May 2007,  the Department has completed 48 major schools and spent &pound;404 million on the  schools estate. A further 15 major capital schools projects are on site,  representing a further investment of over &pound;250 million. Two additional major  capital works at Lagan College and Tor Bank School are being procured, and work has  not yet commenced on site.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">This morning, I was at a newbuild opening on the lower  Falls in Belfast, and I was at St Cecilia&rsquo;s  College in Derry yesterday. Indeed, in Derry  alone, there have been major investments in St Mary&rsquo;s College, St Cecilia&rsquo;s  College and Lisneal   College. Two weeks ago, I  attended the opening of the Belfast   Model School  for Girls, which is a wonderful school that does good work and provides high  standards.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  You were an hour and a half late.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: The Member, who is also the Chairperson of the Committee for  Education, is very rude. I hope that he is not suggesting that I should have  missed my Question Time to attend the opening of that school. We should have  more respect for these institutions and for the Assembly. I went to the school  immediately after Question Time. We should not have a begrudging approach to  this. The Chairperson of the Committee for Education is acting inappropriately. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: The  Minister mentioned Lagan   College. Will she provide  the House with an update on the progress that has been made on the project at  that school?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I thank the Member for her question. As she will know, I have  visited Lagan College, and it does good work. The  project is in the process of being procured, and it is one of the two school  projects that will go forward next.</p>
      <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Schools: Lisanelly Site</p>
      <p class="OralAnswers-Question">5. <strong>Mr  Buchanan </strong>asked the Minister of Education what level of commitment she has  received from the schools in Omagh to move to the proposed shared educational  campus on the former military base at Lisanelly. (AQO 578/11<a name="AQO57811"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I thank the Member for bringing this matter to the House,  because it is one that is close to my heart and in which I have an active  interest. Indeed, I established and chaired the related working group.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">N&iacute; d&oacute;igh liom gur f&eacute;idir feidhm n&iacute;os fearr a bhaint as  iar-bhun&aacute;it de chuid arm na Breataine n&aacute; &iacute; a bheith ag cur le sol&aacute;thar  oideachais.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There could not be a more laudable use of a former British  Army base than to enhance education provision. The Lisanelly project offers a  unique opportunity to provide the young people of Omagh with access to a broad  and balanced curriculum in state-of-the-art accommodation. The co-location of a  number of Omagh schools, including Arvalee   Special School,  on a single campus will enable schools to share expertise, reduce duplication  and provide courses that are sustainable in the longer term. The project will  benefit not only the young people enrolled in schools on the campus but pupils  from other schools in the Omagh area. It represents a unique opportunity on  this island to deliver the integration of education.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">This exciting project is in the early stages of  development, but, even now, it captures the imagination of all involved. I pay  tribute to Rev Robert Herron and Monsignor Joseph Donnelly, co-chairpersons of  the Lisanelly shared educational campus steering group, for the leadership that  they have provided in getting the project to this stage. I am also encouraged  by the support of other stakeholders in the area, including Omagh District  Council. The design team, which was appointed in March 2010 and which works  with schools in the area, has produced preliminary concept plans and indicative  designs of the site layout. For those involved, the process of developing those  early plans has increased understanding of what the project is about and hopes  to achieve and has highlighted how the shared campus could change the way in  which future education is delivered for the young people of Omagh.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have seen the outline master plan, and I am more  convinced than ever that this is a truly remarkable opportunity. Pupils,  parents, teachers, principals, school governors and, indeed, the people of  Omagh will be excited about the possibilities that the campus offers. The  detail will be available for all to see following the launch of a consultation  later this week, and I look forward to going to Omagh to be with the people  involved. Following that consultation, the next phase will be to move to more  detailed planning. I envisage that, at that stage, all schools in the Omagh  area will be able to avail themselves of the facilities and will be actively  involved in the project.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  I listened carefully to what the Minister said, and I have no doubt that she is  out of touch with the people of Omagh. The Minister will be aware that the  business case is for six schools to come on to the campus. Given that only  three schools are committed to the campus, does the Minister really think that  it is a viable project? Does she think that, as Minister, she can bully the  other schools to come on to the site by starving them of future funding in the  most discriminatory manner?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I absolutely reject those comments and the tone in which they  were made. I have met the people of Omagh. I have met Danny McSorley, who  represents the district council. I have met the Catholic trustees and the  co-chairpersons of the project. I have seen the leadership that schools in all  sectors demonstrate. The point needs to be made that this is a dynamic project.  It is a project through which we have a unique opportunity to build a most  amazing educational campus on a former British military site in the heart of  Omagh.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The outline business case will have to show value for  money, regardless of the number of schools that move to the Lisanelly site.  Equally, any school that would like a newbuild will have to include Lisanelly  as part of a business case. That is the way in which it works here. I refute  the Member&rsquo;s bullying claim. Indeed, I am very disappointed by that comment.  Omagh is very lucky to be getting this project, and the people of Omagh  understand that.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Will the Minister explain why it  is important that the project progresses, given the financial constraints now  and the possibility of future financial constraints?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: In the current financial climate, there is a need to focus on,  and to address, the issue of sustainable schools, a need for shared planning of  capital provision and a need to make optimum use of scarce financial resources.<span class="SectionMarker"><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Unlike previous Ministers, I am not going to build schools  that will be empty in a couple of years&rsquo; time. That would not be a good use of  public money.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">3.00 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">School capital provision can no longer be taken in  isolation; it must be taken in the context of the overall needs of an area. It  is, therefore, important for Omagh to seize the opportunity, as such sites  rarely become available. That is particularly true of a site of such magnitude,  which has the potential to provide for a shared educational campus. This is not  even just about educational issues; it is about the regeneration of a town &mdash;  the town of Omagh.  The project will have benefits for every sector of the community, which is why  all sectors are supporting it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">T&aacute; tairbh&iacute; oideachais, s&oacute;isialta agus eacnama&iacute;ochta le  baint amach tr&iacute;d n&iacute;os m&oacute; comhroinnt san oideachas. There are educational, social  and economic benefits to be realised through greater sharing in education. This  unique project offers the opportunity for a number of schools to co-locate on  the Lisanelly site and to explore and plan the campus to include shared  facilities that will allow all the young people in Omagh to have access to  state-of-the-art facilities that offer a broad and balanced curriculum.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We will have all types of schools on the campus, and that  will allow all the pupils to interact with one another. I am particularly  pleased that Arvalee   School and Resource  Centre will be on the campus, because it has much expertise to offer other  schools.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Buchanan&rsquo;s comments about the Lisanelly site do not sit  very well with his party leader&rsquo;s support for the integrating of education. It  would be interesting to know what that party&rsquo;s policy is on the issue. Is it  the case that it is for selection and against selection and that it is riding  two horses?</p>

      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question 10 has been withdrawn.</p>
      <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Student Fees</p>
      <p class="OralAnswers-Question">1. <strong>Mrs  McGill </strong>asked the Minister for Employment and Learning whether, since taking  up office, he has had any discussions with Joanne Stuart or the students&rsquo;  unions on the proposed increase in student fees. (AQO 589/11<a name="AQO58911"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning (Mr Kennedy)</strong>: On the same day that a public  petition on student fees was presented to the Assembly, I was grateful that, at  my request, representatives from the National Union of Students (NUS) and the  Union of Students in Ireland (USI) and the presidents of the student unions at  Queen&rsquo;s, the University of Ulster and St Mary&rsquo;s University College were able to  meet with me. That gave me an early opportunity to hear their views and  concerns, and I gave them my assurance that, because I recognise and value the  contribution that they have to make, they will remain fully involved in the  process.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Indeed, my Department recently reconstituted a key  stakeholder group for the development of future student finance policy, and the  first of a series of meetings over the coming months is taking place this  afternoon. The NUS/USI will be key members of that stakeholder group.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I spoke with Joanne Stuart and subsequently met her on 17  November to discuss the updating of her report in light of the publication of  the Browne review, the UK Government&rsquo;s response to that review and the new  context in which the higher education debate is taking place following the  announcement of the details of the comprehensive spending review.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I assure the House that I share the concerns both of  Members and Executive colleagues on how the future fees and student finance  policy will be impacted on by the impending budget reductions across  Departments. Therefore, I underline again the urgent need for all those  involved and with an interest to commit to a responsible, mature and democratic  debate on the issue of higher education funding and fees.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his response. I thank him especially for his continued  engagement with the students and with Joanne Stuart. Given that Joanne Stuart&rsquo;s  review was commissioned in 2008, that it commenced in 2009 and that we received  the report a couple of months ago in 2010, does the Minister have any sense of  the time frame for the completion of the update? This is a matter of urgency.  It is my belief that some young people and their families will suffer if the  matter is not sorted out fairly soon.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I thank the Member for her supplementary question.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As the Member and the House will know, the Stuart report  was commissioned by my predecessor and pre-dated the Browne review at UK level.  Therefore, it would have made no sense to publish Stuart without knowing the  outcome of the Browne report.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Joanne Stuart&rsquo;s report made a number of recommendations and  was submitted to my predecessor in March this year. However, the economic  climate was changing quickly, and Joanne Stuart&rsquo;s report expressly indicated  that it would need to be reviewed in the light of Lord Browne&rsquo;s report.  Therefore although it was appropriate to publish the Stuart report at the same  time as the Browne report to enable a fully informed public debate to begin, it  is also very important that Joanne Stuart be given the opportunity to update  her report.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That is being done in the light of the Browne report, the  Government&rsquo;s response to it, and the comprehensive spending review. I am  pleased to say that we expect Joanne Stuart to report to me by the end of this  year so that I can assess matters and make recommendations to the Executive  and, ultimately, to the House.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  Will the Minister confirm that it is his belief that access to university  education should be based simply on ability to learn and not on ability to pay?  Will he send a message to parents and concerned students that there will be no  material increase in fees in Northern Irish universities in the foreseeable  future?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I am grateful to the Member for his question. As  the newly appointed Minister, I have made it clear that my view and guiding  principle is that places at university should be based on ability to learn and  not on ability to pay.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We are in a difficult economic climate. I will certainly  not make the mistake of prejudging the outcome of Joanne Stuart&rsquo;s deliberations  or the ongoing Budget negotiations. It is important that those Budget  negotiations be concluded and that we form a Budget so that there is clarity  and certainty about the future of the matter.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have to caution the Member that it is, perhaps, a mistake  to make promises that may be difficult to keep in the current economic climate.  I am not interested in that. I need to see the detail of Joanne Stuart&rsquo;s report  to me, and I need to be aware of the financial implications of the  comprehensive spending review settlement for my Department.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer. Does the Minister agree that it is vital  that the debate in Northern Ireland  avoids the disgraceful scenes of violence recently witnessed at a student  protest in London?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I thank the Member for his question. I strongly  agree with his sentiments and utterly condemn the despicable scenes of violence  witnessed at the student protest in London.  The democratic right to protest carries the responsibility to do so in a  peaceful and law-abiding fashion. Instead, in our nation&rsquo;s capital, police  officers were injured, the property of a democratic political party was  attacked, and our nation&rsquo;s capital was scarred by mob violence.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased that the local NUS leadership saw fit to  condemn that thuggery. There is a weighty responsibility on the student  leadership, nationally and locally, to ensure that all protests are peaceful.  Inflammatory language can have no part in the debate on university funding.  That underlines the urgent need for everyone to commit to a responsible, mature  and democratic debate on higher-education funding and fees.</p>
      <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Universities: Research and Development</p>
      <p class="OralAnswers-Question">2. <strong>Mr  Gardiner </strong>asked the Minister for Employment and Learning for his assessment  of whether continued investment in research and development in universities is  essential to secure future economic growth. (AQO 590/11<a name="AQO59011"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: Investment in research and development is  absolutely vital for securing economic growth. It is the engine of innovation,  and it is innovation that drives growth and economic development. Therefore, it  is essential that the Executive continue to give a high priority to investing  in our universities&rsquo; research and development programmes. That is especially  important in Northern Ireland,  where research undertaken by universities plays a significant role in the  economy compared with the rest of the United Kingdom.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In Northern Ireland,  universities account for nearly half of research and development expenditure,  which is around twice the UK  average. That is mainly due to the high number of small to medium-sized firms,  which, historically, are unable to fund research projects. That, in turn, places  a greater responsibility on the Government here to ensure that the higher  education sector is properly resourced to undertake high-quality research, so  that the economic benefits of such investment are available to the wider  population of Northern    Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">At the recent US/Northern Ireland investment conference in Washington, existing investors from the USA commented that the high quality of the  research and development work at Northern Ireland  universities, the skills of the workforce, and the relationship between  business, academia and Government were the main reasons for locating their  operations in Northern    Ireland. Therefore, it is essential that our  current levels of investment are maintained, if not increased, in the  forthcoming Budget.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his reply. Does he think that the present level of  investment in research and development can be sustained in the absence of the  innovation fund?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I thank the Member for his supplementary question.  My Department and I are committed to continuing to support the further  education sector in carrying out its research and development activities to  support the needs of businesses, particularly its work in emerging and  specialised areas such as wind technology, engineering, information and  communication technology, and electronics, which will contribute to the growth  of our economy. Further education sector research and development initiatives  include the South   West College&rsquo;s  InnoTech centre, which is working with a range of local small and medium-sized  enterprises to assist them in developing new ideas and products and bringing  them to market. Carbon Zero Northern Ireland is a further education sector-wide  project which is carrying out research and development in the specific area of  sustainability. Those two initiatives have been funded through my Department&rsquo;s  innovation fund, which is a time-limited programme and is due to conclude in  March 2011. We have bid for resources to sustain those and other good projects.  If they are not funded, it will be very difficult to continue with that work.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>:  Many Members will welcome your commitment to research and development in our  universities. Can you assure us that the twin pillars of investment in quality  education and the success that we have in Northern   Ireland in placing more working-class children in  university than any other part of the United Kingdom will continue to go  forward together?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I am grateful to the Member for his contribution,  and I entirely agree. The secret to finding a successful resolution to our  economic problems lies in encouraging and developing research and development,  as well as training and skills. That surely has to be the guiding principle of  the Executive: that even in straitened economic times we can find our way  through this and give hope, particularly to our young people.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Can the Minister inform us of any  consideration that he has given, or intends to give, to encouraging further  co-operation in research and development between universities in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I will take this opportunity to welcome the new  Member to Question Time and to thank him for his question. Co-operation is  always dependent on a good working relationship between universities across not  only Northern Ireland but  the Republic of Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If there are sensible initiatives, for which funding is  available &mdash; and I suspect that funding will be the key issue, not only for Northern Ireland but for the Republic of Ireland,  given its particular economic problems &mdash; my officials and the universities will  be keen to explore mutually beneficial opportunities.</p>

      <p class="OralAnswers-Question">3. <strong>Mr  Easton </strong>asked the Minister for Employment and Learning to outline what  funding or programmes are provided by his Department to promote further and  higher education in working-class Protestant areas and for his assessment of  the level of success achieved to date. (AQO 591/11<a name="AQO59111"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: Raising education attainment at post-primary level  is critical to ensuring the widest pool of applicants to further and higher  education. Although that is most properly a matter for schools and for the  Department and Minister of Education, higher education institutions can play a role.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In the academic year 2010-11, my Department allocated more  than &pound;2&middot;2 million to promote widening participation in higher education. That  figure includes &pound;700,000 funding for special projects, such as the Step-Up and  Discovering Queen&rsquo;s programmes, to support work to raise aspirations and  education attainment in schools in working-class areas. Much of that special  project work is undertaken in schools in working-class Protestant areas with  traditionally low levels of progression in education. In addition, my  Department will provide &pound;1&middot;5 million in widening-participation premium funding  to support recruitment and retention of students from less-advantaged  backgrounds.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In 2000-01, almost 5,000 enrolments in courses at local  further and higher education institutions were from students from the most  deprived areas in Northern    Ireland who declared their community  background as Protestant. By 2008-09, that figure had risen to nearly 7,000,  which is an increase of around two fifths. Those trends are encouraging.  However, stubborn pockets remain, including those in working-class Protestant  areas where participation is not as high as it should be.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, I am not complacent: my Department currently  leads the development of a regional widening-participation strategy that aims  to further improve the progression rates of all under-represented groups. That  demonstrates my Department&rsquo;s continuing commitment to that important issue.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his answer. I am not sure whether he is aware of the  Kilcooley Women&rsquo;s Education Centre in North Down, which offers programmes to  working-class Protestant women and is now branching out to provide programmes  to men. The centre is funded by Peace III, the Department for Social  Development and the Irish Government. Will the Minister make a commitment to  the House that he will visit the centre to see the excellent work that it  provides to working-class Protestant communities, and that he will look at  funding that he can arrange to help them to progress their educational status.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I am grateful to the Member for his question.  Obviously, an invitation from the group would be considered carefully. I would  like to see whether I could pay a visit to observe the important work that is  being done and to see whether progress could be made on that. I am aware that,  apart from the Member, other local representatives made expressions to my  predecessor on the issue. I hope that, perhaps, a visit could be arranged at  the earliest opportunity in order to explore possibilities.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his commitment to all under-represented groups, not  just to those from one section of the community.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">One problem that was highlighted during the Committee&rsquo;s  NEETs (not in education, employment or training) inquiry is the difficulty,  with regard to data collection and tracking, in following a student after he or  she has left school at 16 years of age. Has the Minister had any more success  with the Minister of Education to bring about good co-operation between the two  Departments on following students and on provision of good careers advice? It  is my understanding that, at present, some schools can refuse to take up your  Department&rsquo;s careers advice, which is critical if young people are to select  the right further and higher education courses.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I am grateful to the Member for her supple&shy;mentary  question, and I pay tribute to her work as Chairperson of the Committee for  Employment and Learning and thank her for that. I accept entirely her point  that co-operation and collaboration would be and will be the sensible way  forward. Departmental officials and I will be seeking to achieve progress on  ensuring that we can make a difference to the lives of young people who, unless  we can deal with this issue in a comprehensive manner, will continue to face a  very uncertain future.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  answers, not only to this question but to the previous questions. It is useful  that more people outside of the Committee know about the widening participation  scheme. In one of his earlier answers, the Minister talked about the ability to  learn versus the ability to pay. If you go for the ability to pay, does the  Minister have any idea of what the impact would be on working-class communities  if an increase in student fees were imposed on students?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I thank the Member for her comments and for her  supplementary question. I am loath at this stage to get into a discussion on  figures, except to say that I have already stated that the allocation of  university places should be based on the ability to learn and not on the  ability to pay, and that we want to retain our position at the top of the UK  league in respect of widening participation, so that our universities are  places that are welcoming and open to students from all backgrounds.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Budget negotiations will be critical, and I would like  to see early progress on those. The whole country, regardless of whether people  have an interest in education, health, roads or industry, is looking to the  Assembly and the Executive for clarity and certainty. They want to know that we  can get in place a Budget that will, at least, chart the way forward to enable  us to deal with the very difficult economic issues that we face and to do so  with a degree of greater certainty.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I call Mr Jonathan Bell for a question. I am sorry; I call  Jonathan Craig.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>: I  do not know whether to thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
      <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Student Fees</p>
      <p class="OralAnswers-Question">4. <strong>Mr  Craig </strong>asked the Minister for Employment and Learning when he will be in a  position to report on any changes to student fees. &nbsp;(AQO 592/11<a name="AQO59211"></a>)</p>
      <p class="OralAnswers-Question">9. <strong>Mr  Girvan </strong>asked the Minister for Employment and Learning what measures his  Department is taking to address the potential increase in student fees. (AQO  597/11<a name="AQO59711"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: With your permission, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will  answer questions 4 and 9 together.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is a legislative cap on what fees Northern Ireland  universities can charge. Any change in that will need Assembly approval.  Subject to clarification of the budgetary position, my Department will bring  forward options and proposals early in 2011 and, subject to Executive  agreement, a public consultation on tuition fees and student finance will  follow. After the con&shy;sultation, I will bring proposals to my Executive  colleagues for the approval of the House.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>:  Does the Minister agree that there is an imperative to sort this situation out  very quickly, because, although the House can prevaricate over its budgets for  the next four years, individuals, especially parents, cannot prevaricate over  how they will fund their children going to university? They need some  clarification and certainty on the issue, and the sooner that they get it, the  better.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I am grateful to the Member for the point that he  makes. I am happy to give my complete support to the emphasis on achieving an  early resolution to the budgetary considerations that myself and Executive  colleagues are undertaking now. It is in the interest of everyone that we bring  forward a Budget that can be consulted upon, reviewed and, if necessary,  amended, even by the House. There are a number of budget holders in my  Department who are keen to see the level of expenditure, or lack of it, that  they will have to deal with in the new financial year.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In my view, we cannot risk running through until the end of  this financial year before confirming a Budget, because that will have  implications for the new financial year and will incur unnecessary costs. So I  hope that all parties in the Executive will work together quickly to bring  forward a Budget and that external matters, such as by-elections or impending  general elections in other jurisdictions, will not affect those deliberations.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Mr P J Bradley is not in his place for question 5. Mr Thomas Burns  is not in his place for question 6. Mr Kieran McCarthy is not in his place for  question 7. Mr Simpson Gibson is not in his place for question 8. Question 9  has already been answered. Question 10 has been withdrawn. Question 11: Mr  Boylan is not in his place.</p>
      <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Employment: Training</p>
      <p class="OralAnswers-Question">12. <strong>Mr G  Robinson </strong>asked the Minister for Employment and Learning to outline what  level of co-operation exists between his Department and industry to identify  training courses which meet employers&rsquo; requirements. (AQO 600/11<a name="AQO60011"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I am grateful to so many Members for not turning  up today, but I thank the Member for his question. He will be aware that the  Department has a great deal of contact with local industry, and the focus of  our efforts over recent years has been to ensure that the Department&rsquo;s support  for training provision mirrors the needs of local industry &mdash; a demand-led  system. That has been articulated in many departmental publications, such as  &lsquo;Further Education Means Business&rsquo; and the skills strategies.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In practical terms, we have engaged with local industry  through, among others, the workforce development forums and the sector skills  councils, which we sponsor and the role of which is to work with employers to  identify current and future skills and training needs and to develop solutions  to meet those needs. In addition, the Northern Ireland Adviser on Employment  and Skills has provided valuable intelligence on future skills needs. We have  also engaged with industry on our Bridge to Employment programme over many  years.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We are currently working with Invest NI on the Assured  Skills programme, which seeks to ensure the delivery of a range of activities  and interventions that guarantee potential inward investment companies, or  existing investment companies that wish to expand, that Northern Ireland  has the ability to satisfy their future skills and training needs. Also, our  Skills Solutions service, which is now up and running, has the specific aim of  providing employers with a learning and skills service that identifies and  helps meet their training needs. Our Skills Solutions advisers have been active  across Northern Ireland  since September, including in East Londonderry.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, qualifications underpin the delivery of all  vocational education and training, and the Department is leading on the  implementation of the cross-UK vocational qualification reform programme in Northern Ireland.  Employers are now at the heart of the system for developing and delivering  vocational qualifications, and all vocational qualifications on the new  qualifications and credit framework are based on employer-owned standards and  strategies.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer. Will he give us an assurance that he will  encourage industry to communicate its needs to his Department to ensure that  suitable courses are provided?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: In so far as it is within my power, I certainly do  give that commitment.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  I am very conscious of the time, Mr Deputy Speaker; thank you very much for  calling me to ask a supplementary question. I am sure that the Minister would  love to pad out his 30 minutes. Given that most of our industry is based on  small family businesses and small industry in general, and given the added  difficulty that poses for the Minister&rsquo;s Department in trying to bring skills  programmes forward, has he any forethought as to how a basic skills potential  might be developed in the workforce so that, when the uplift eventually comes,  we will have people partially trained and partially moved along the road  towards training?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I am grateful to the Member for his question. It  is my priority, as Minister, and that of my departmental officials to have in  place the necessary training and skills &mdash; both vocational skills and academic  opportunities &mdash; in preparation for the economic upturn.<span class="SectionMarker"><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Although there is an economic depression at the  moment, it is right that we prepare our workforce for the upturn and give  encouragement to young people so that we stand ready to benefit from the  opportunities that will come to us, I hope, in the not too distant future.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Gerry McHugh is not in his place to ask question 13.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That concludes questions to the Minister for Employment and  Learning.</p>
      <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="7"></a>Committee Business</p>
      <p class="H4StageHeading">Assembly Members (Independent Financial Review and  Standards) Bill: Second Stage</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Debate resumed.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  welcome Members&rsquo; support and thank them for their contributions. It is  noticeable that, at the Second Stage, a limited number of Members spoke. That  is a good sign, as it shows that there is wide consensus in the House. The Bill  is uncontroversial, and everyone accepts that it is common sense. Members  therefore took the view that they did not need to add to the volume of debate. Nevertheless,  I thank those who contributed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will address the issues that were raised, and if Members  feel that I did not cover all of them, I am more than happy to write to them.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Declan O&rsquo;Loan spoke as Chairperson of the Committee on  Standards and Privileges. He set out clearly the rationale and principles  underlying Part 2 of the Bill. Accountability and transparency are fundamental  in upholding confidence in the democratic process, and those principles inform  the provisions for the Assembly Commissioner for Standards. The commissioner  will be independent. He or she will not need the Assembly&rsquo;s permission to carry  out an investigation into an allegation of misconduct; indeed, there will not  even need to be a complaint for him to carry out an investigation. The  commissioner will have the power to commence an investigation where they  believe that a breach of the code may have occurred.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Declan O&rsquo;Loan reminded us why the Committee on Standards in  Public Life has emphasised that such a power is so necessary. He also explained  how the Commissioner for Standards will determine how an investigation is to be  carried out, albeit within an agreed time frame. The commissioner will be able  to reach and express any conclusion on the outcome of an investigation, and the  Assembly will always publish those conclusions. That enshrines the notion of  transparency in Part 2 of the Bill.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Willie Clarke spoke about the consensus in the Committee on  Standards and Privileges in favour of the provisions in Part 2. He also spoke  of how the situation at Westminster  has damaged, in many cases unfairly, the perception of all politicians. He  concentrated on Part 2 and said that it went some way to rebuilding confidence.  It is interesting to note, with reference to holding people to account, that my  remarks on Part 1 seem to have been completely ignored by all other Members who  spoke. I will take that as suggesting a high level of consensus on my remarks.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Reverend Robert Coulter, who is not in the Chamber, issued  a clarion call for a return to a Cromwellian era. In other contexts, that might  not be shared by all Members. He spoke of the importance of a robust system for  holding Members to account and of the values of clarity and transparency. I am  pleased that he recognised how the Bill will provide for those principles to be  put into practice.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As we move ahead with the Bill, it is clear that there is a  high level of consensus on the principles of Parts 1 and 2. When the Bill  passes its Second Stage, the next stage is the establishment of an Ad Hoc  Committee for its detailed scrutiny. That will enable Members to comment on it  and to make sure that its detail is absolutely right.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am confident that the establishment of the independent  financial review panel and the Assembly Commissioner for Standards are positive  steps forward for the Assembly and that they will significantly enhance the  independence, openness and transparency of the processes. Therefore I commend  the Bill to the House.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>

      <p class="H4StageHeading">Integrated and Shared Education</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30  minutes for the debate. The proposer will have 10 minutes to propose the motion  and 10 minutes to make a winding-up speech. One amendment has been selected and  published on the Marshalled List. The proposer of the amendment will have 10  minutes to propose and five minutes to make a winding-up speech. All other  Members who wish to speak will have five minutes.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: I  beg to move</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That this Assembly notes the report by Oxford  Economics, &lsquo;Developing the Case for Shared Education&rsquo;; believes that the  current education system is unsustainable; recognises the economic, educational  and social benefits that can come from integrated and shared education; and  calls on the Minister of Education to actively promote a system of integrated  and shared education throughout Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We are pleased to bring the motion to the House today. It  can be broken down into four parts, which we will look at in some detail later.  However, at the outset, I confirm that we will not accept the SDLP&rsquo;s amendment,  which we see as a dilution of our original proposal.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will start with a couple of quotations:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;I do not know of any measures which would prepare the  way for a better feeling in Ireland than uniting children at an early age and  bringing them up in the same school&rdquo;.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The second quotation is a bit more current and is slightly  shortened:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;For me this is not just an economic but a moral  question. We cannot hope to move beyond our present community divisions while  our young people are educated separately&hellip;I believe that future generations will  scarcely believe that such division and separation was common for so  long&hellip;Future generations will not thank us if we fail to address this issue.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The second quotation was from Peter Robinson, as part of  his now famous speech from a few weeks ago. The first was from the Roman  Catholic Bishop of Kildare in 1825. I am making the link that there is a common  cause that I was not aware of until now.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I could offer many more statements of support for shared  education, some from surprising sources. Indeed, yesterday, we talked about  Lord Craigavon, who is on record as being a supporter of the shared education  concept. However, as I speak, and despite all that support over the years, our  schools are still over 90% segregated.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The maintained sector is pressing ahead with its own  post-primary review, which appears to pay scant regard to the needs of our  school population as a whole. It is no more than a reorganisation of the  Catholic school system. The controlled sector insists that, as a state system,  it is open to children of all faiths and none, as, indeed, does the maintained  sector, but they both utterly fail, with a few honourable exceptions, to  attract pupils from across the divide. There is a major conundrum. As far as I  am aware, all the political parties are on record as supporting shared  education. All three main sectors &mdash; I exclude the Irish-medium sector only for  the obvious reason of its unique nature &mdash; support the concept. The Department  of Education, under the terms of the Education Reform (Northern Ireland) Order 1989, has a duty to  encourage and facilitate the development of integrated education, which means  the education together at school   of Protestant and  Catholic pupils. Would an objective study of the Department&rsquo;s actions in that  area conclude that it had tried to carry out that duty with anything  approaching enthusiasm? The Department may have facilitated where it had little  option, but it has fallen well short on encouragement.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Despite opposition, the integrated movement has made steady  progress. It proved that parental choice is a potent force and that children  who learn and play together in their early years carry forward attitudes and  beliefs that benefit the child and society. Peter Robinson said:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;If one were to suggest that Protestants and Catholics  would be educated at separate Universities it would be manifestly absurd; yet  we continue to tolerate the idea that at primary and secondary level our  children are educated separately.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Are those wise words from a surprising source? We  should not be surprised at common sense from whatever source it comes. I  continue to welcome the First Minister&rsquo;s statement.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Oxford Economics report, as others before it, makes the  financial and economic case for shared education. It does not come up with a  definitive figure, but does anyone continue to doubt that the present  arrangements cost hundreds of millions of pounds in duplicated expenditure and  that the system is unsustainable? Do the statistics of empty desks, school  building and maintenance programmes that are badly behind and the crumbling  schools estate and morale not point the way towards an urgent need for  cross-sectoral co-operation as an absolute imperative? Does anyone still doubt  the economic, educational and social benefits? If so, they live in a different  world from me.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">What is the way forward? A complete change of mindset is  required at all levels. The motion calls on the Minister actively to promote a  system of integrated and shared education, which goes going beyond the  encouragement and facilitation that is required by the Order. I do not refer  solely to the establishment of new integrated schools or transformations. They  have their place, which is an important one, but we will never get to where we  want to be purely on that basis. We suggest a target, which is that 20% of  children should be educated on an integrated basis by 2020.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Where new schools are planned, the Department should survey  local residents on the presumption that they will be integrated or  inter-Church. The Department should reform and relax the criteria for the  creation and maintenance of integrated schools in a way that recognises those  children who are of mixed or no religious background. It should review the transformation  procedure and recognise the contribution that is being made by mixed schools,  which are those with a mixed enrolment but no formal integrated status. I  recommend Belfast   Royal Academy,  which is my old school, as a good example.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We must acknowledge and promote shared learning schemes, of  which there are plenty. I know that the Minister favours those. Indeed, we  spent most of today&rsquo;s Question Time on that topic. The Sharing Education  programme, which is run by Professor Tony Gallagher&rsquo;s group, has just started  its second three-year session. The feedback from the first three years from  pupils and teachers is extremely positive. As some 60 schools and 5,000 pupils  were involved, that is a good sample. Virtually none of the schools that were  involved in that project and in others across the country has reported any  difficulties, which perhaps proves that the younger generation has a bit more  tolerance than the previous one.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Be that as it may, more radical actions are needed. What  does area-based planning mean if decisions continue to be made on a sectoral  basis? When will the Department obtain the powers to insist that a maintained  school and a controlled school must come together as the only viable solution  for a particular area? Are we going to continue to transport children in  different directions in order to get to the nearest school in their sector,  rather than to the nearest suitable school?</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Recently, I spent time in the Dominican College  in Portstewart, which is a maintained school with a Presbyterian headmaster. It  is absolutely unique, with 40% of its pupils being Protestant. It manages to  maintain a Catholic ethos without causing offence to its Protestant pupils.  Religious education is taught jointly and without a problem, and the school co-operates  fully with other local schools in a way in which Tony Gallagher would totally  approve. It is the way forward and an excellent example of what can be  achieved.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: No.  I am sorry, but I do not have time. You will both have time in which to speak.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Things cannot stay as they are; the situation is  unsustainable, so I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s response.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Having given the First Minister such praise, I will say  that the cohesion, sharing and integration (CSI) document for which his  Department is responsible was pretty sparse in acknowledging reality and the  problems associated with segregation in the education system. We believe that  increased sharing and integration in education to bring children together in  their formative years is absolutely fundamental to creating a cohesive and  integrated society, and we hope that the final CSI strategy will reflect that  widely held view. This is not the first debate that we have had on the subject,  and it probably will not be the last. Nevertheless, I hope that the change in  mood in the country, along with the comments of Mr Robinson and others, may  produce progress. I support the motion.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  I beg to move the following amendment: Leave out all after the first &ldquo;Shared  Education&rdquo; and insert</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;; upholds the principle of parental choice in  education; recognises the contribution to education made by the various  education sectors; and calls on the Minister of Education and the Executive to  encourage continued integrating and sharing between the various education  sectors to maximise the educational, societal and financial benefits and to  protect the provision of local schooling.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. &Eacute;ir&iacute;m leis an  leas&uacute; a mholadh.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I shall begin by outlining the SDLP&rsquo;s position on education  provision. We believe in parental choice, whether that is in Irish-medium,  maintained, controlled or integrated education, and I have proposed the  amendment to recognise that choice. Therefore, I hope that the proposers of the  motion will think again. Trevor Lunn extolled the virtues of parental choice in  integrated education. If parents can have choice in integrated education, why  can they not have it in the other sectors?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We respect the diversity in our system, and we uphold  parents&rsquo; rights. A sign of maturity in society will be people&rsquo;s ability to  accept diversity as something that adds richness to their lives, without  attempting to colonise under one flag or another. Having said that, much can be  done in education to encourage cohesion, sharing and integration without losing  diversity. We do not believe that sectors should work in isolation, and there  are compelling education, societal and economic reasons why that should not be  the case. We encourage the maximum possible sharing in the delivery of the  entitlement framework and throughout education phases, from early years to  primary education and on to post-primary education.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In planning and provision of the schools estate and in all  other aspects of education, there are clear economic reasons why we should  share staff, facilities and buildings. Important as those reasons are in the  present economic climate, they are not the only or even the most important  reasons for doing so. It can only be good educationally for children from  various backgrounds to get to know one another as individuals, to be taught and  learn together, and to play games and sport together. It is good for social  cohesion that that should happen, and I believe that most parents would welcome  it. In a society with a history such as ours, we cannot continue to live in  splendid isolation from one another. We must take positive steps to ensure that  our education system becomes more integrated than it is at present, promoting  sharing while respecting diversity. That can and should be done. Greater  sharing in, and integrating of, education cannot and should not be forced on  any sector but should be encouraged and fostered in every way possible. It  should be done for the right reasons.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Given the Member&rsquo;s comments about encouraging people to go in a particular  direction, does he agree that that is one of the fundamental mistakes that has  been made in the debate on academic assessment; that the bully tactics of the  Minister of Education have not worked, because we still have academic  assessment; and that the duplicity of the SDLP in not accepting the right of  parents to choose academic selection has led us to the stalemate that we are  in?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  I do not accept the particular point that the Member makes. Every attempt has  been made to encourage people to come along the path of allowing all children  to have access to all types of education, and I hope that we will get to a  better place in the future.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, encouragement to share and to integrate should  be done for the right reasons and in the right way. The issue should not be  used as a political football in an attempt to win votes, as has recently been  the case. We should work with the various sectors and encourage them to work  together. The various education providers are more aware than most of us of the  challenges that are involved. We should listen to them when they tell us what  they need to increase sharing, and we should provide them with the tools that  they need.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Area-based planning is a useful tool in achieving greater  sharing of staff, facilities and buildings for economic and curricular  purposes. It is a good basis for greater sharing that goes beyond the mere  functional. The professional expertise of teachers is such that the  area-learning communities have made reasonable progress on meagre resources and  in a short time. As &lsquo;Together Towards Entitlement&rsquo; indicates, there is still  much to be done in that area. Instead of reducing the resources available for  that work, we should, in fact, be increasing them, and the Minister of  Education should be championing that cause.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We do not underestimate the challenge that greater sharing  in education presents, but we should not shy away from it. The work of the  area-learning communities is encouraging, as is the work done by the Sharing  Education programme managed by Queen&rsquo;s University. The co-operation that exists  between the two primary schools in Stewartstown is exemplary, as is that  between the two secondary schools in Ballycastle. I am interested in the  sharing of sports facilities that has been developed between St Patrick&rsquo;s High  School in Keady and Armagh   City and District  Council. There is a similar project in St Columba&rsquo;s College in Portaferry and an  emerging project at St Colman&rsquo;s College in Newry. Those are examples of sharing  that is beneficial to the community and the school population. We should build  on existing good practice and learn from it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is also good that the Churches will consider shared-faith  schools. As politicians, we should be working to remove any barriers that may  prevent development in that area. Legislative changes are needed to enable the  development of more innovative and creative solutions. Under current  legislation, there is no mechanism to establish jointly managed schools between  sectors or even between phases. As a first step, we must make changes to  legislation that will allow greater sharing between and across the sectors.  Without those legislative changes, progress will be very difficult to achieve.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The goal of achieving sharing in education may be a  long-term one, but it needs to be fostered and encouraged. It is one of the  pillars of the SDLP&rsquo;s policy on a shared society, and we will continue to  champion it, not only in the weeks ahead but in the months and years to come. I  believe that, if we adopt the right approach to the issue by working with the  sectors and not attempting to browbeat any sector in any way, we will achieve  progress. That is the way to progress. I hope that parties in the House will  agree with and support the SDLP amendment. T&aacute; m&eacute; bu&iacute;och d&iacute;ot, a LeasCheann  Comhairle, agus sin a bhfuil uaim.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education (Mr Storey)</strong>: At the outset, I will make some  comments as the Chairperson of the Education Committee and highlight some key  information that the Committee has received on the subject. The Committee is  sometimes accused, even by the Minister, of not producing any great amount of  work of substance. Therefore, I want to put on record what the Committee has  done on the issue.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We received a presentation from Oxford Economics on its  paper entitled &lsquo;Developing the Case for Shared Education&rsquo;. At its meeting of 20  October, the Committee also received a presentation from the Integrated  Education Fund, which highlighted the results of the 2009 Life and Times  Survey. That showed that 62% of people would prefer to send their children to a  mixed religion school in contrast to just under 7% of children who attended  integrated schools. The Integrated Education Fund representatives also  commented on the Department of Education&rsquo;s response to the Committee on the Integrated  Education Fund&rsquo;s earlier position paper on segregated education. The Department  stated:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;In law, all schools in Northern Ireland are open to all  pupils regardless of religion. &hellip; To date, Government has accepted this as an  expression of parental wishes and has not attempted to impose integrated  schools.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Integrated Education Fund responded by saying that it  believes that we should no longer settle for community segregation as a reason  for segregation in schools. Schools that are in receipt of public money should  be expected to demonstrate how they are actively seeking to be open to all pupils  regardless of religion. From a Committee perspective, perhaps the Minister  might explain to the House what her Department meant by:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;To date, Government has accepted this as an  expression of parental wishes and has not attempted to impose integrated schools.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Does that imply that the Department&rsquo;s position may  change in the near future and that shared education may be a way forward? We  await a response from the Minister, who we are glad is in the House this  afternoon. Given the Integrated Education Fund&rsquo;s point, what is the Department  of Education doing to ensure that all schools are actively seeking to be open  to all pupils regardless of religion?</p>
      <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Molloy] in the Chair)</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, the Committee noted the Queen&rsquo;s University report  on options for sharing and collaboration, which concluded that, in the most  successful models of school sharing, ethos and religious traditions are not  only protected but strengthened. It would be worthwhile for the Minister and  her Department to examine successful models of school sharing and to consider  how to further implement those ideas.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will now speak as a Member of the House. I welcome the  opportunity to do so, and I commend the Alliance Party for bringing the motion  to the House. I also commend the First Minister, my party leader, for  kick-starting the debate. It has generated various responses. The responses  that my party and its leader have received are interesting.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in has accused us of attacking Catholic schools.  Nothing could be further from the truth. The bishops accused us of denying  parental choice. However, it is interesting that the bishops who made that  claim &mdash; Dominic Bradley referred to Dominican College in Portstewart &mdash; are the  very same bishops who, in the commission&rsquo;s consultation paper on the review of  post-primary education, included Dominican College as one school that will be a  sacrificial lamb because of the plans that the bishops and the Council for  Catholic Maintained Schools (CCMS) have for education in that part of the world.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Moreover, a few weeks ago, Loreto College  told us that it had abandoned academic selection. That is not the case. It has  rearranged the criteria to ensure that it has a bigger intake of children at  the expense of St Joseph&rsquo;s High School in  Coleraine and of Dominican   College.<span class="SectionMarker"><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Whether the issue concerns a single education  system or a single education and library board, people need to come to the  debate with integrity, honesty and openness. They need to ensure that their  arguments are put in a way that does not threaten, or, as Dominic Bradley said,  bully any individual.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Clarity is needed on what is meant by integrated education.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Draw your remarks to a close.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: We do not mean the current system of  integrated education, because that was the creation of another sector. We mean  a genuine, single system that respects rights, privileges and having a  Christian ethos in schools, and we need to continue to work towards that. I  support the motion.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Sinn F&eacute;in will be supporting the SDLP  amendment.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As the Chairperson of the Education Committee said, the  Alliance Party&rsquo;s motion has brought a debate to the Chamber that has been  rumbling in the media and in the education sector for some time, and I welcome  the chance to be part of that debate. At the outset, it is fair to say that  everyone recognises the need to pursue collaboration between the various  sectors in education where possible and to espouse that as much as possible.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I also put on record my recognition of all the sectors in  education that work hard for the good of their students: the Irish-medium  sector, the Catholic sector, the integrated sector and the controlled sector.  Educating young people and assisting them to reach their full potential is most  certainly a challenge, and we all aspire to, and recognise the need for, an  education system that delivers for all the young people who go through it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion appears to suggest that the Alliance Party is  saying that the only way that children and young people can be educated is via  integrated education, and that this will be the answer to ending sectarianism  in our society. It also appears to suggest that the only factor that is making  our schools unsustainable is that there are various education sectors. It needs  to be recognised that the education system does not deliver for all our young  people. It fails quite a number of them. I remind the House that 4&middot;5% of young  people leave school every year without any GCSEs or any equivalent  qualifications, and 12&middot;5% leave school with fewer than four GCSEs graded A to  G. A 2006 Audit Office report was quite damning and stated that over half of  14-year-old boys who attended non-grammar schools across the North had not  achieved basic standards in literacy and numeracy.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Those are some of the examples that make the current  education system unsustainable. There is a need to continue to drive through  the policies that the Minister has initiated and implemented, particularly  Every School a Good   School, area-based  planning, transfer reforms and, most importantly, the establishment of ESA,  which was to drive forward standards. The Chairperson can laugh all he wants,  but, quite frankly, the education of young people is not a laughing matter.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Oxford Economics paper is a scoping paper with the aim  of stimulating debate, and that is why we are debating this issue. The paper  gives three reasons why we should look at alternatives, the first of which is  international competitiveness. It suggests that we are behind our international  competitors, and I believe that no Member disagrees with the idea that we need  to build a strong economy and that, to do so, we should work towards the needs  of the economy. Young people should be encouraged towards pathways where there  are jobs and where there are deficiencies, but, as has been said in many  previous debates in the House on education and on the economy, this is not  simply an education issue. We need to look at the issue on a cross-departmental  basis, with DEL,  the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI), the Office of the  First Minister and deputy First Minister (OFMDFM) and the business community  becoming involved.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The second reason that the paper gives for the need to  change is the financial situation. No one is taking away from the fact that  there are obvious financial benefits to collaboration, and, as I said at the  outset, I support fully collaboration between, and in, our sectors. They should  all be encouraged to work together where possible. Examples were given of where  that happens already, and that needs to be built upon. Area-based planning  policy, which the Minister is taking forward, should also assist in that  process, but we have to be realistic. To ensure sustain&shy;ability in many  schools, they need to work together, and collaboration is necessary, especially  in rural areas where there are smaller schools.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The development of ESA is a further issue to be considered  in light of financial considerations. It has been said many times in the  Chamber that the realisation of ESA would allow the Department to reallocate  &pound;20 million to front line services, and it is not good enough that other  parties have tried to block that and to play games.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  I will come back to ESA in a few minutes&rsquo; time, and I will let the Member in at  that stage.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The third issue that the paper deals with is how our  education system works and the fact that it is made up of various sectors. A  point that was raised by the proposer of the amendment is that surely that is  an issue of parental choice. People are entitled to have their children  educated in a system that, in the first instance, promotes equality, but it  must also be a system of choice. Again, the issue of ESA arises. The Assembly  agreed a position on ESA. There was a Programme for Government commitment to  ESA, and Members of the House &mdash; I am talking particularly about the Members  opposite &mdash; voted for that position on the basis that we would streamline  education.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member bring her remarks to a close?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  Again, however, they have reneged on and shied away from that commitment.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  My time has run out.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  That was particularly well timed. I must remember that one.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We keep having the same old debate, albeit in different  guises. It is a different topic but the same old argument. There is something  unedifying about people trying to play politics with our children. There is an  issue, and I do not think that anybody can turn round and say that everyone  else is playing party politics with it except them. There are some serious  issues, and we need to find a way of getting consensus. Part of the problem is  that we are trying to do an awful lot with one policy tool. We are trying to  look after the rights of individuals to an education, but we also want to get  the economy and the environment right. We do not want schoolchildren to travel  too far, and some people want to deal with sectarianism in the community. We  are trying to do everything with a single policy tool.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">People talk about schooling and its problems, and they trot  out statistics about how bad things are. However, it must be remembered that  70% of all education comes from outside the school. The issues come from the  children&rsquo;s environment, whether they live in social disadvantage or otherwise  and from their cultural background. We have to tackle those issues in a  holistic way. I am a believer in integrated education, although, as Mervyn  Storey pointed out, it depends on what is meant by &ldquo;integrated&rdquo;, which is a  debate worth having. We might find a common way forward if we were to define it  slightly differently.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have something of a problem with the Alliance Party&rsquo;s  motion. I was at the Committee when the paper was put forward, and I understand  why it was commissioned and brought forward by the Integrated Education Fund  (IEF). As I said, I am a supporter of the IEF, but the motion is a rehash of past  positions. We have moved forward. The IEF says that it wants to look at  collaboration. Perhaps it is not about bricks and mortar, but about attitudes  and minds and how to work together. Perhaps the idea was to generate debate. If  so, it was probably overshadowed by the intervention of the First Minister.  Whatever his particular motivation, it is worth exploring exactly what we mean  by integrated education. Can we have a constructive debate about how we try to  deal with such things?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  On that point, is the Member as bemused as I am by how the Alliance Party  presented the motion? It refers to integrated and shared education, and I am  sure that the party chose the two words separately to mean two different  things. Yet its Members told us that they absolutely rejected the SDLP  amendment, which, it seems to me, defines a broad range of sharing. It would be  useful if, later, the Alliance Party would clarify what it means by &ldquo;sharing&rdquo;.  Although the Alliance Party chose to put that word in its motion, when we  defined the many different models of sharing that are in place, and whose usage  could be increased, its Members rejected that.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member has an extra minute in which to speak.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Perhaps there was a certain looseness in the drafting of the motion. It seems  to be a reiteration of age-old arguments, rather than bringing anything new to  the debate. I share with the Member the notion that choice, particularly  informed parental choice, is important. Although some people will favour  integrated education, others will favour a faith-based education system, but  one in which there is collaboration. Where possible, we should try to engage  parents in the education of their children.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party&rsquo;s argument about why the system is non-sustainable  is confusing. The real reason why it is unsustainable is the number of empty  desks in schools. However, society must make the choice about whether to merge  schools from a similar sector or from across sectors. Other models have been  envisaged, and I am sure that the Member will be aware of the work of one of  the pro-vice chancellors of Queen&rsquo;s University, Tony Gallagher, who has looked  at the different models and ways of schools&rsquo; working together. I do not dismiss  existing ideas, but we can deal with the issue in that context.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The most important people in children&rsquo;s education are  parents. They should be involved, informed and given the opportunity to do what  they think is best for their children. We should, of course, take on board the  views of children and others, but who knows better than parents? My party  supports the fundamental right of choice, although unlimited choice is not  economically viable. Nevertheless, where it is viable, we should give people  choice. Where it is not, we must explain to them that we are working under  financial constraints and we are trying to get them together.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We did not object to ESA&rsquo;s way of streamlining the  administration of schools. Rather, we objected to changing the purpose of ESA  to do something that it was not originally intended to do. If parties want us  to work constructively together to find a way that satisfies most people&rsquo;s  concerns, we will not be found wanting.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Bring your remarks to a close.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  We support the SDLP amendment.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hilditch</strong>:  Like others, I welcome today&rsquo;s debate. Northern Ireland is going through  significant changes, and we are trying to break down the barriers of  segregation. We cannot expect to end divisions in society if we continue to  educate our children separately. There is no doubt that continuing to do so  will leave the doors wide open for the sort of problems that we have been  trying to eradicate over the past few years. The benefits of a shared education  system are not merely financial but will play a role in transforming society.  We want Northern Ireland  to aim for a shared future.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The first phase of the sharing education programme  commenced in September 2007. In its first three years, more than 5,000 pupils  from more than 60 schools benefited from additional educational opportunities  across a wide range of curricular and extracurricular activities. The shared  programme contributes practically to the role that education has to play in  shaping the future of Northern    Ireland through the continuing development  of area learning communities. Schools involved in partnerships will be able to  bring their experiences of partnership working to their communities.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Some pupils said that the project gave them the chance to  do subjects that they would not have otherwise done, to meet other people and  to learn new things. Others said that they got to see someone else&rsquo;s school and  the differences between schools. It is not only pupils who gain from shared  education, parents and teachers can form relationships across cultural and  traditional barriers. Teachers said that many of our problems stem from  ignorance and that children&rsquo;s going to school together can only broaden their  education.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The programme has released the imagination and creativity  of staff, pupils and parents, and their response has been astounding and  inspirational. There is no doubt that the programme enables young people to  gain academic and vocational qualifications as well as invaluable life-learning  experiences that they can use in their journey into adulthood.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As has been mentioned, Queen&rsquo;s University set out on a  mission to reveal the educational benefits of a shared education in 2007. It  believes that a shared education will bring considerable and demonstrable  educational and community benefits to Northern Ireland. The partnerships  that majored in primary to secondary school partnership arrangements offered  different kinds of impacts. The educational benefits to primary schools with  limited resources were clear, and reference was made to the timeliness of  intervention before attitudes hardened. They have demonstrated the enormously  positive potential in collaborative learning.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Let us not forget that there is more to shared education  than education and social issues. There are also financial gains, with the Bain  report suggesting that up to &pound;75 million could be saved if schools work  collaboratively. The shared education model should provide practical evidence  that collaboration can work to the benefit of schools and pupils.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: On  Monday, I had a group of students up here from Queen&rsquo;s University. They said  that there was no way that they would ever allow a further education system in  which blacks were discriminated against compared to whites, in which Catholics  were separated from Protestants, or in which Hindus were separated from  Muslims. They asked me why, then, we do that at initial education. Does it not  make economic sense to follow the model that Peter Robinson outlined and to go  for shared education from day one?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hilditch</strong>:  Mr Bell makes a valid point. I am glad that he interjected.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Much higher levels of collaboration, joined-up thinking,  joined-up action and integrated working will shape the future of Northern Ireland.  As a society, we do not want to persist with division. Future generations will  not thank us if we fail to address the issue. At a time when public money and  resources are extremely limited, schools should work together to maximise  effectiveness.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is hoped that shared education is adopted, taken on  board and encouraged by schools. Our children deserve more during their  education and aspire to an integrated future. We have the opportunity to  transform the education experience. Therefore, I ask for a joined-up approach  from all relevant Departments, as has been suggested, so that we can make that  change sooner rather than later.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. As my colleague Michelle O&rsquo;Neill  said, we support the SDLP amendment. However, it is our view that if no  amendment had come forward, the Alliance Party motion was broad enough for us  to offer it our support. The motion can be interpreted in a number of ways and,  as this is politics, we interpreted it in the way that we chose.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Speaking as a DUP Member, the Chairperson of the Committee  said that there has to be &ldquo;integrity, honesty and openness&rdquo; in the debate;  three brave words for any politician to come out with in any debate. So, let us  have a wee bit of openness around where the motion, and Peter Robinson&rsquo;s speech  several weeks ago, came from.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I note the Oxford Economics report. However, it does not  advance the debate. It relied largely on information that was available to  Members, and perhaps elaborated on that, but that was its only value.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have listened to the contributions, particularly those  from the DUP Benches and DUP commentators, around Mr Robinson&rsquo;s speech on  moving towards integrated education. It may be more open, honest and fair to  say that it was more about closing down Catholic education than it was about  integrated education. If someone is serious about any radical proposal, they  choose carefully how they deliver it, where they deliver it and how the message  is broadcast. I have said on several occasions, but it is worth repeating, that  Mr Robinson chose to deliver his speech at Castlereagh Borough Council, chose  to speak to a largely unionist audience and chose to tell the audience that he  wanted to close down Catholic education, to which he got a positive response.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: I know that the Member protects the  Minister, but it is a pity that the he does not advise her. Yesterday, at St  Dominic&rsquo;s Grammar School, the Education Minister was in front of a grammar  school audience. What did she say?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>A Member</strong>:  Today.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: I got the day wrong.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">She battered them over the head with academic selection.  She did not have the decency to engage with that sector in an open, honest and  fair way. Therefore, I will not take a lecture on behalf of my party leader as  to when and how he conducts his business.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member has an extra minute.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Point taken. However, as someone who has worked closely with the Education  Minister for several years, I assure the Member that she does not need  protecting. She is more than capable of protecting herself.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The fact of the matter is that the DUP has not entered this  issue from the path of righteousness. The DUP has not entered this with the  genuine concern that it wants to see integrated education or tackle  sectarianism. Rather, it entered it because it sees the Catholic education  sector as a threat to its vision of society. That is, in my opinion, why the  DUP raised the subject. It does not see it as threat because of Catholic religious  teaching or theology, but because of the way in which the nationalist community  is educated. The DUP wants to break that down to create a schooling system that  produces a ceramic vision of each other as little Northern Irelanders. That is  a mistake in itself.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">No one can argue against shared education or an integrated  education system as part of our vision for the future. However, we are where we  are. We have parental choice, and, as far as I am aware, all the parties around  the Chamber support that. Parents have a right to decide where to send their  children and, in the majority of cases, they send their children to their local  school. That is particularly true of the primary-school sector. Parents do not  look around and see a Catholic school or a state school. Rather, they see a  good local primary school and make the decision to send their children there.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We live in a divided society, and, naturally, many in the  Catholic community send their children to Catholic primary schools and  secondary schools, and those in the unionist community send their children to  controlled schools. That is a result of our society, and it is not the fault of  the education system that we have a divided society. When sectarianism and the  divisions in our society are debated, it is a mistake for us to point to the  education system, claim that the blame lies there and feel that we would have a  better society if only we were to educate our children together. That is part  of the answer and solution, but it is not the answer in its totality. It is  easy for someone to present the argument that they oppose sectarianism and will  challenge it by challenging faith-based education or Catholic education. That  is not a challenge to sectarianism, but, in fact, it raises its spectre.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in will not be found wanting when it comes to  encouraging and moving towards shared education facilities. It will also not be  found wanting in encouraging any sector to move in that direction.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Bring your remarks to a close.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: However,  we are where we are. I call on people not to point the figure at the education  system and blame it for the sectarianism in our society.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  I support the motion as tabled. The venue in which my party leader chose to  deliver his speech last month is totally irrelevant. However, I welcome the  quotation that Trevor Lunn made from that speech when moving the motion. In  that speech, Peter Robinson outlined his vision for an integrated education  system, and although there are those in some quarters who believe it to be some  form of Damascene moment, nothing could be further from the truth. Indeed,  anyone who looks back over the debates in the Chamber during the past number of  years will note the repeated position of DUP Members and their desire to have  an integrated education system. However, what we mean by an integrated  education system is not the same as that which exists in the integrated sector,  a point that Mervyn Storey was starting to expound on when his time came to a  close.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We have been steadfast in our belief that no sector should  be favoured over others, which is the case when it comes to viability criteria  and club banking for the integrated and Irish-medium sectors. Such favouritism  costs money. Those issues have been debated on numerous occasions in the  Chamber, and the usual silo-mentality based comments have been drawn from  vested interests and their apologists from inside and outside of the Assembly,  which is much like the reaction from the Catholic Church, the SDLP and Sinn F&eacute;in  to Peter Robinson&rsquo;s statement. In his own very eloquent way, my colleague Mr  Storey expounded on the responses received by my party leader.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There needs to be a reality check. Constant lip service is  paid to a shared future by Members on the Benches opposite, and if that is  truly what is wanted, one of the primary origins of division, the school  system, needs to be addressed. I listened to Mr Bradley extolling why there  needs to be sharing in education. He spoke of sectors not continuing to live in  splendid isolation and cited many good examples of that working in practice.  However, he objects to moving forward in a manner that is more than  aspirational. What he is really looking to do is to reinforce the sectors.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There are numerous advantages to an integrated education  system, and Mr Lunn has set them out. The motion refers to economic,  educational and social benefits. I have already touched on the cost of sectoral  favouritism. A Sinn F&eacute;in Member raised the matter of ESA, but clarity needs to  be brought to that issue before we get lost in Sinn F&eacute;in spin. Sinn F&eacute;in knows  rightly that it is the lack of equality in the Bill that was presented that  made it unworkable. The DUP is not opposed to the idea of a single education  board. However, we have difficulties with what is on offer, because it favours  some sectors over others. The sector that would suffer most notably at the  hands of the Education Bill would be the controlled sector.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: It is clear that Members, particularly  those on the Benches opposite, were partial in the elements of Peter Robinson&rsquo;s  speech that they listened to. In the very same speech where he referred to a  single education system &mdash; a speech that he made at Castlereagh Borough Council  offices &mdash; Peter Robinson also referred to a single education board. That seems  to have been overlooked because it does not suit the party on the Benches  opposite to hear that part.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member will have an extra minute.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  Just for clarity, the speech was made not in Castlereagh Borough Council  offices but at the La Mon Hotel.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We will go back a bit and talk about parental choice, which  was raised by Sinn F&eacute;in and the SDLP, particularly in its amendment. Both those  parties wish to destroy parental choice in academic selection, and thus to  destroy grammar schools. Therefore, there is a certain amount of hypocrisy  around the idea of parental choice.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Turning to social benefits &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  No, I do not have time, but thank you anyway.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Peter Robinson referred to separate schooling in Northern Ireland  as:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;a benign form of apartheid, which is fundamentally  damaging to our society.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">As my colleague Mr Bell said before he left, we do  not educate our young people in separate universities, so why do we teach them  in different schools? By doing it, we become entrenched in our differences. Why  wait until adulthood? Separate schooling normalises division. As you would  expect, I support Peter Robinson&rsquo;s call for a commission to be established to  produce recommendations on a process of integration, as he outlined in his  speech. That would be money well spent, not only because of the savings that  could be made but to lay the foundations for what would be a truly shared future.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Although the Oxford Economics report does not set out the  same vision, it does highlight the absurdities of the current position. It is a  scoping paper and, therefore, throws up matters for debate. It is important  that that debate should occur. There is no point in certain bodies retreating  to their silos and refusing to contribute positively. Education is not about  protecting vested interests. It is about teaching our children to best prepare  for adulthood. It is about opening their minds, not inculcation. The debate has  now begun. We know the cost of division, and it is not counted simply in  monetary terms. It is now a matter of taking steps to address it.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Sir Reg Empey</strong>:  I thank the Members for tabling the motion and the SDLP for its amendment. Reflecting  on the debate, we are faced with four challenging issues. The first is the need  to build a genuinely shared future in Northern Ireland that is based on  respect, understanding and working together. That is crucial, not only for the  good of our communities and future generations but for the future success of  our economy. The education system has a crucial role to play in that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The second issue is that we face significant fiscal  constraints that will place serious strain on the Department of Education. That  is coupled with a significant increase in the number of empty seats in our  schools. There is, therefore, a genuine need to rationalise our schools estate.  The 2006 Bain report suggested that it might be possible to save up to &pound;75  million in the education budget if schools worked collaboratively.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The third issue facing us is an existing system that was  developed over time and based on ethos education, which, although having its  faults, is working in the main.<span class="SectionMarker"><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is proof that faith-based schools provide better  results than schools that do not have a defined ethos. The crucial element  linked to that point is parental choice. The Ulster Unionist Party strongly  supports the principle of parental choice and recognises that it is a key  element in any civilised society.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The fourth element is the rural/urban split in provision  and sustainability. There is no doubt that rural schools are under more  pressure when it comes to sustainability than their urban counterparts.  However, rural schools can form the backbone of local communities and, in many  cases, keep them viable.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion reflects some of the changing thinking in the  integrated education sector, which is welcome. That sector is beginning to recognise  that there is a need for a more organic approach to sharing instead of just  going down the Integrated &mdash; with a capital &ldquo;i&rdquo; &mdash; route, which could lead to new  schools opening at the expense of existing schools or to a heavily centralised  and top-down approach whereby our education system is essentially secularised  by the state. However, the wording of the motion does not reflect adequately  the need for community buy-in and commitment when it comes to any changes in  our education system.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is worth reflecting on some other recent developments.  In a recent speech, the First Minister, who has been referred to, appeared to  be advocating a secularisation of the education system. That would see a more  centralised approach, which would remove the influence of the Roman Catholic  Church in the maintained sector and the Protestant Churches  in the controlled sector, thus creating a one-state system.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The true motives of that move can be debated another time.  However, that approach ignores the right of parental choice and the needs of  local communities. The Ulster Unionist Party strongly believes that we should  be rationalising with a view to sharing. We should be promoting cross-sectoral  collaborations, be they formal, through the entitlement framework, or informal.  We must be looking towards future rationalisation, be that by exploring shared  faith schools, community schools or shared facilities, predicated on community  buy-in and support. Shared services and facilities might also be appropriate,  if encouraged by area planning.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">However attractive the rhetoric in support of a single  state system for Northern    Ireland might be, especially for financial  reasons, it is unachievable until a consensus can be created to bring it about.  Megaphone tactics simply will not work.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The proposers of the motion regularly draw attention to the  costs of division. We all know that there are costs associated with division,  but there is the same argument about the peace walls. We all want the peace  walls to come down, but, if Mr Lunn lived in Cluan Place, maybe he would be less  enthusiastic about bringing the peace walls down. It is very good to bring them  down as long as one does not live near them. We have to understand where our  society is.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The way forward will not be more &ldquo;commissionitis&rdquo;, as the  Member for Strangford thinks. The way ahead is for parties in the House to sit  down and discuss the issues together. We do not need more commissioners. We can  discuss the issues; that is what we are here for. I do not see the need for  more commissions, but I do see the need for proper dialogue.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We have to be realistic and recognise the right of parents  to choose as well as the economic realities. We have the capacity, if we put  our minds to it, to bring a debate forward with proper inter-party dialogue so  that we will be able to advance the case.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  I have no intention of reiterating everything that my colleague Dominic Bradley  said earlier in the debate. Therefore, I will keep my contribution short.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP supports integrated education because we support  freedom of choice. That is why we chose to table an amendment to the motion.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Parents and children should be able to be educated in  whichever medium they choose, and the same provision should be afforded to  every child. It is because of our support for parental choice that we were  disappointed by the First Minister&rsquo;s remarks about faith-based schools. Echoing  the CSI strategy, the First Minister&rsquo;s stance on integrated education has  further proved that the Executive is more about entrenchment than integration.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Each education sector has brought significant benefits to  schooling in the North, and I want to make special mention of the work of my  local schools and the very successful way in which they work with the learning  communities.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP is deeply committed to protecting the provision of  local schooling. For a number of years, the Department of Education has been  closing down schools, especially in rural areas. As finances get tighter, we  fear that that trend could accelerate. For that reason, integrating and sharing  in education has become paramount. Few issues in government can truly be said  to save money and provide societal good. If managed correctly, however, that  could be one such area.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In addition to supporting integrated education, it is  imperative that the Department of Education assist each sector in sharing  resources to proceed towards better integration. The amendment standing in my  party&rsquo;s name offers a fair and cohesive way forward, and it expands rather than  negates the motion. I urge all Members with a view to fairness, integration and  cohesion to support the amendment, as I do.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education (Ms Ruane)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I  welcome the debate and the opportunity to discuss the many issues that the  motion raises. I thank my colleague Trevor Lunn as one of those who brought the  motion to the House.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Before getting into the detail of the Oxford Economics  report, &lsquo;Developing the case for shared education&rsquo;, we need to confront all  divisions, including segregation based on social status, rather than simply  cherry-pick those that sit neatly with particular party political perspectives.  I am for integrated and secular state education, but that cannot mean the  imposition of the culture and ethos of one political perspective at the expense  of another.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">An inclusive education system with which everyone can feel  affinity should be developed in partnership and agreement with all sectors of  the education system. That cannot mean hockey instead of hurling, English  instead of Irish or Oliver Cromwell instead of P&aacute;draig Pearse. However, it  would be a mistake for anyone &mdash; I agree with my colleague John O&rsquo;Dowd on this &mdash;  to lay the blame for segregation and sectarianism in our society at the  doorstep of education, or on those who championed education during very dark  days in the history of this state. Our current education system has evolved as  a result of sectarianism; it is not the cause of that sectarianism.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">T&aacute; cuid mh&oacute;r easaml&aacute;ir&iacute; ann den dea-chleachtas sa ch&oacute;ras  oideachais, ach aonta&iacute;m nach bhfuil an c&oacute;ras reatha inbhunaithe. There are many  good examples of good practice in our education system, but I agree that the  current education structure is unsustainable. The Assembly has already voted in  favour of a single system: the Education and Skills Authority (ESA).</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Let me remind Members what they voted to support. The ESA  will be a single system of administration to support a diversity of schools; a  system that will promote equality while preserving choice; a system that puts  the needs of children and young people before the needs of institutions; and a  system that empowers school leaders to drive change and improvement.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The educational case for change is clear. Our education  system is failing many of our most vulnerable young people, and I will not  rehearse those arguments. Michelle O&rsquo;Neill spoke about them.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Humphrey</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: No. The financial case is also compelling. Under the Education  and Skills Authority, it will be possible to redirect &pound;20 million a year from  administration to front line services. The findings of the Oxford Economics  report support a range of policies that I have already introduced. It could be  said, however, that the report tells us merely what the Assembly has already  concluded.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The case for the ESA is clear. The legislation for the ESA  is ready, and it awaits the DUP living up to its public pronouncements that it  wants to tackle bureaucracy, to invest in front line services and, most  importantly, to improve standards, especially for young people from deprived  areas.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We have some five working months left in the present  Assembly mandate. That is five months to lead a once-in-a-generation reform,  and five months to modernise and secure the future of our children&rsquo;s education,  and, in turn, our economic potential to build out of recession. I am not  standing still in the interim. I have progressed with convergence plans to  secure savings in the confines of the current system.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Today must be my lucky day, because I am highlighting DUP  wriggling on hooks. Get off the hooks. Get off the hooks on academic selection.  You have abandoned your 1989 policy. I told you earlier, and I do not need to  go into it again.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: Will the Minister give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: No. The Minister will not give way.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: Will the Minister give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I will not give way, because we have listened to the Member. Now  he is jumping up and down because he knows that he is wriggling on a hook  again. The DUP offered up excuse after excuse for failing to progress the ESA.  One minute it was one thing, the next minute it was something else, and now the  party is looking for another reason. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: You can see that the party is getting jittery when its Members  are jumping up and down. Can they explain to the front line why they are  squandering the opportunity to save &pound;80 million by establishing the ESA? I  welcome change. I love change. People know that. I welcome debate.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with Declan O&rsquo;Loan that it is amusing to see the  DUP change policy so quickly; however, it forgot to tell its Members that it  had done so. Therefore they heard about it on TV or after their leader, Peter,  talked at Castlereagh council.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mervyn gave a wonderful speech supporting the integrating  of education. He is on the board of governors of a school that wants to  transform. Parents voted for it &mdash; parental choice in action &mdash; but, lo and  behold, who tried to block it but Mervyn and one of his councillors.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: Will the Minister give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: No; I will not give way. The Member had his chance. The Member  would do well to be polite and listen for a change. There were other comments  on integrating from none other than Iris Robinson. She said, and I assure  Members that these are not my words, that the philosophy of the integrated  lobby:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;consists of nothing else other than self-righteous,  pompous claims of reconciliation, no more amazing than claiming that they can  fit 200 people into the back seat of a Mini.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">People are entitled to change, and I welcome that; however,  the problem is that they do not get it all joined up. At today&rsquo;s Question Time,  a Member of the DUP came out against one of the most innovative projects of  sharing.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If we are to have this debate, Members cannot do 90-degree  turns. As Reg Empey said in his very considered contribution, let us have real  discussion not megaphone diplomacy, and let us do it on the basis of respect.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Calls are made for one system, only to be followed by  attacks on the Irish-medium sector. Why would you do that if you wanted real  debate? Let us have a real debate here. The way to go forward is on the basis  of respect.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I was asked about integrated education. I take my statutory  duty to encourage and facilitate the development of integrated education very  seriously. Since I became Minister of Education, the number of children  attending integrated schools has increased from 17,600 to more than 20,700; I  have approved development proposals for a new grant-maintained integrated  post-primary college; I have transformed three existing primary and one  post-primary school to integrated status; I have established one integrated  statutory nursery school; and I have approved 71 capital schemes in 28 schools  in the sector to the value of more than &pound;10 million.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Let us talk about post-primary transfer. Of course, as the  integrated sector recognises, a fully integrated school does not just mean  bringing together all communities; it means a school that operates admissions  that do not reject children on the grounds of ability. This morning, I spoke at  St Dominic&rsquo;s with the President of Ireland, Uachtar&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann, and I was  absolutely true to my principles.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">My principles are that public money should be spent in  areas of high social need. The week before last, I was in the Belfast Model   School for Girls; today,  I was on the lower Falls. However, I said clearly in St Dominic&rsquo;s that it must  use public money wisely and it is important that it does not erect barriers for  children. That is my party&rsquo;s position. Everyone knows that. Sinn F&eacute;in does not  wriggle on hooks; Sinn F&eacute;in takes policy positions and speaks up for what it  believes in.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, two of our integrated post-primary schools  persist in partial academic selection, but, apart from that, I am pleased that  the sector as a whole recognises that an ethos of welcoming and valuing all  children is incompatible with academic selection at 11 years old, as reflected  in the Department&rsquo;s transfer guidance. I hope that the two schools that operate  partial selection will stop doing so.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We must address social division &mdash; the class divide &mdash; which,  like the academic selection of the past, is extremely damaging. It was a failed  system, socially and educationally, which created and sustained injustice and  inequality. It is fundamentally immoral and has no place in a modern,  progressive and enlightened society.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I absolutely agree with Reg Empey about the importance of  the entitlement framework and area-learning communities. As I said earlier, and  as Trevor Lunn also mentioned, the entitlement framework provides new  opportunities for pupils to achieve their full potential. There cannot be four  A-level classes in the same town doing the same course over a two-year period  when those classes have only four or five pupils.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: Will the Minister give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I do not know what part of the word no or n&iacute;l the Cathaoirleach  does not understand.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We need to use resources wisely. It stands to reason that  allowing pupils access to a wider range of courses that interest them, which  are relevant to their future career aspirations and which reflect the economy&rsquo;s  needs, will give them the best possible chances. Some amazing work is being  done. A few weeks ago, I was in north Belfast  with 600 teachers from every sector. They came together on a day when schools  were off to discuss how they could timetable and work together. Area-based  planning is needed.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Humphrey</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: No. Everybody in the Chamber had an opportunity to be heard.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I have been fairly tolerant. First, the Minister indicated to a  number of Members that she will not give way. Secondly, there must not be an  ongoing commentary from a sedentary position. I ask Members to respect the  House.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Benefits are to be  realised through greater sharing in education. A unique opportunity has arisen  through the gifting of the Lisanelly site in Omagh for education purposes. That  landmark project offers the opportunity to bring together a number of Omagh  schools on the Lisanelly site and to plan the campus to include shared,  state-of-the-art facilities, to which all young people in Omagh will have access.  I will go there on 25 November 2010. I look forward to my visit very much.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Aithn&iacute;onn mo dhr&eacute;acht-pholasa&iacute; um chaidreamh pobail,  comhionannas agus ilchine&aacute;lacht san oideachas go bhfuil comhoibri&uacute; ar si&uacute;l  cheana f&eacute;in.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">My draft policy for community relations, equality and  diversity in education recognises that collaboration already exists and, more  important, seeks to build on that greater sharing and collaboration. As I said,  a great deal of collaboration is happening, and Dominic Bradley mentioned some  of it. It does my heart good to see different uniforms in different schools in  areas where one would not expect to see that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">When I visited the Belfast Model   School for Girls, one  teacher told me of how she works with Col&aacute;iste Feirste on the Falls Road.  Teachers are way ahead of many politicians because they actively encourage and  support collaboration. Indeed, the Integrated Education Fund has indicated that  more than 1,000 schools &mdash; more than 80% of schools &mdash; are already engaged in  some form of shared education. Is that enough? No. Can more be done? Yes. My  Department encourages more to be done. Indeed, with any funding streams that  are coming on board, whether for extended schools or shared education, we  encourage clustering and schools to get together. Members would be genuinely  amazed to see what goes on. Young people should be educated together. We must  find ways to do that through the diversity of provision that exists at present.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Oxford Economics report is simply a scoping exercise;  the authors acknowledge that. I noted in the Hansard report that when the  Integrated Education Fund presented its report to the Committee for Education,  members expressed concerns, including the failure to address key economic  issues; the fact that the financial argument did not stack up; the lack of  depth; and the failure to address barriers to shared education. I agree with  all those concerns. We need to deal with issues of parental choice, community  readiness and political impetus. We will do that. It is noteworthy that the  author acknowledged that there is little difference between the IEF&rsquo;s  recommendations and those of the Bain report, in which my Department has been  actively involved.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Representatives from the integrated education fund also  acknowledged that cost savings will not be made through sharing at first, and  that, initially, it will cost money. There was recognition that savings are  most likely when schools come together on a single campus similar to the  Lisanelly site, which I have already outlined.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">This is a complex agenda, and has been seen in recent  weeks, it is often viewed as a sensitive subject on which there are differing  views. Greater integration and sharing is something to which we should all  aspire. It will come about as a result of the comprehensive, robust and  evidence-based approach in which my Department is actively engaged. Go raibh  maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I thank everyone who contributed to the debate. I think that we will all agree  that this is a debate that needs to start: in fact, I guess that it has  started. I rise to sum up and conclude the debate on the amendment that was  tabled in order to frame the debate and put it in a better context, one that is  rooted in a series of basic principles that have been echoed by colleagues in  Sinn F&eacute;in and the Ulster Unionist Party and by my colleagues in the SDLP. There  is the basic principle of choice, which acknowledges that parents have the  right to pick and do what they believe is best for their children and that that  right should not be fettered or undermined in any way in order to achieve a  political outcome.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The second principle is one of reconciliation and the  genuine sense and determination to try and build a better future for education based  on respect for the diversity in our society.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Humphrey</strong>:  Is the Member aware that Queen&rsquo;s University in Belfast  and Vanderbilt University  in Nashville  have a sister-city relationship? Recently, I met some academics from  Vanderbilt. They were amazed that this city does not have an integrated  education system and that due to the fact that we live in a divided city,  people do not get the opportunity to meet people from other religions until  they go to university or into the world of work? How can we build the sort of  society that the Member is talking about when we retain the status quo in  education?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member has one extra minute.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I thank Mr Humphrey for his intervention. I do not think that there is a single  person in the House who is arguing for a segregated education system for ever  and a day. I did not hear one single Member.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Humphrey</strong>:  They argued for the status quo.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  No. I heard no one argue for the status quo. In fact, I heard everyone argue  for evolution.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: Declan O&rsquo;Loan asked about clarity earlier  in relation to the Alliance Party. However, the Member&rsquo;s party&rsquo;s amendment is  not clear. It contains the word &ldquo;sectors&rdquo;. Does that include grammar schools,  or does it relate to institutions such as maintained schools and controlled  schools? Will the Member clarify what he means by sectors? Will he give  parental choice to parents who want to use grammar schools?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  Our policy on that matter is clear. We believe in the right to ethos-based  education, but we also believe in the opportunity of shared ethos-based  education. We do not believe that there is a cohesive or credible argument  proven anywhere in the world for selecting children at 10 to 11 years of age. I  do not know too many educators who believe it either. One either accepts or  does not accept that argument.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The key issue at the heart of today&rsquo;s debate is about  whether we are going to be capable of building on what we have achieved and  whether we can take the best bits of faith-based and ethos-based education and  make them better by building on shared facilities, as we are able to do. To  some extent, that is the easy part. It is also about exploring ways in which we  can remove the legislative barriers to shared-faith schools over time, as  Dominic Bradley suggested.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The question for us is not whether we can look back to a  solution that would have fitted well in an old multicultural analysis of Maggie  Thatcher&rsquo;s Britain in the 1980s or whether we can reinvent education in this  region that is not based on the notion that we have a shared allegiance to a  particular outcome, but on our diversity and the need for intercultural  dialogue. That is a principle that we could be seeing a lot more of in our debates.  If we had more of that in our cohesion, sharing and integration strategy, we  would have a much better situation in which to frame this debate.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Basil McCrea makes a very important point. Education cannot  solve all of our problems. It cannot tackle the crisis in sustainability in our  regions; it cannot deal with every division in our society; our children are  not the pawns through which we will recast and deal with all of our problems.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">However, I am quite clear when I say that we have a massive  and shared duty to be able to acknowledge that, if we are to reframe and recast  education in this century, we will have to do so by building on respect for the  system that has evolved and for what has worked in the past, without in any  sense being complacent about the fact that change is needed. The systems have  evolved because of bad politics in the twentieth century. Indeed, those points  emerged in our debate yesterday when we discussed Lord Craigavon&rsquo;s legacy.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, again in response to Mr Humphrey, no one argued  for the status quo. I did not hear anyone say in the House today that the way  that we have done things in the past is the way that we will do them in the  future. I do not know of a single state around the world with a faith-based or  ethos-based system that has not outperformed the non-ethos-based system. That  is not a personal opinion; I do not say that because I have a particularly  strong ethos &mdash; it may or may not be the case that I do. It is a matter of fact.  We have a very strong ethos in our education system, and we should not lose it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We are very privileged to have some very fine schools in my  constituency, and when I look at them, I see institutions that bring a very  important mix of identity and commitment to educational excellence. The  opportunity that we have in the months and years ahead is to take the  conversation forward &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member bring his remarks to a close?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  It is also to understand that, in sharing, there is massive opportunity and  that it should not be assumed that a single analysis or basic system will work.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  welcome the debate, and it is important that we have it. In many respects, this  issue is now at the top of the political agenda, and, as far as I am concerned,  it is about time. Some of the contributions have been helpful and  con&shy;structive, some have been realistic and, unfortunately, some have not.  Every time that we talk about sharing and integrating education, there is a  dangerous tendency for us to relapse into the same old tired debate on academic  selection, which has been debated here many times.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We certainly cannot go on with our education system as we  have been in Northern    Ireland. Major financial, economic, social  and human costs result from the segregation that exists in our education  system, specifically the fact that we have 70,000 empty school places. That  situation is only set to get worse, notwithstanding the short-term demographic  blip that we have had. We have inefficiencies in the schools estate, which  means that there are excessive costs for things such as maintenance and running  costs. There are also inefficiencies in school support services. Those are all  costs that the public purse has to bear, bearing in mind that we are talking  about a time of quite severe financial pressure.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We have perhaps the highest spending per capita on  education of anywhere in the UK,  but, at the same time, we are investing less directly in our pupils. That must  point to the fact that something is going badly wrong with the way in which we  are organising our system. We have a huge backlog of school maintenance  projects and a lot of demands for new capital investment. We clearly have too  many resources tied up in the existing inefficient schools estate. Therefore,  things have to change for the better.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party reckons that the current inefficiencies  in our system cost the public purse perhaps around &pound;300 million a year.  Obviously, we are not going to release all that in the near future, but we have  to start on that journey. In the short to medium term we can perhaps realise  &pound;50 million, &pound;60 million or &pound;70 million if we are prepared to take the bold  leaps and put in place the correct policies. It is quite right to observe, as  Mr Humphrey did, that our system looks very strange to international visitors.  It is not the norm internationally. It does not fit well with people who are  looking at it from the point of view of other experiences. That applies  particularly to those from the United    States, where there is a very strong legacy  of segregation.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  On the point of international visitors, will the Member not concede that it is  not just our education system that looks a bit strange? To most people coming  to this part of our little island for the first time, our society looks a little  strange. This issue is about which way you want to argue. To argue that  education is the cause of division and that if we were to fix it we would not  look strange is to seriously simplify the real challenge that we have, which is  to build reconciliation in our society.<span class="SectionMarker"><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">5.00 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  That is also a reason not to do anything to fix the education system.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  Is the Member aware of the excellent work that takes place in Fermanagh through  shared future projects? Some 30% of primary-school children are involved in a  shared project that gains international backing from Atlantic Philanthropies  and from the International Fund for Ireland. It is an excellent project  and one that should be looked at from a Northern Ireland context.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  am happy to recognise that, and as someone who comes from a Fermanagh  background, I am particularly pleased to do so.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member&rsquo;s point about funding from the international  community is also relevant, in that the international community feels the need  to invest in sharing in education. Elsewhere in the world, that would be funded  through the taxation system. We should be very sober about that. The  international community recognises that things need to change and the state has  failed to respond to the situation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to respond to Mr McDevitt, who said that evidence  suggests that, internationally, faith schools are much more successful. I  respect what faith schools have achieved in Northern Ireland. I went to a faith  school, and I am here. I will let people draw their own conclusions from that.  However, the evidence is not as clear-cut as Mr McDevitt seems to suggest. Look  at what is happening in Scandinavia. Those  countries do not have faith-based systems, but they have the best results  throughout their entire system. Look at South Korea, which has made the  biggest leap forward in educational standards in recent years, but does not  have a faith-based system. Mr McDevitt claims that faith-based systems are the  only ones, but cites no other evidence from throughout the world. He has not  looked very far.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I did not say that.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  The Hansard report will reflect what was said.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Let me be clear: the Alliance Party&rsquo;s motion is about  integrated and shared schools. We do not necessarily argue for a single  integrated system. That may well come some day in the future, and we may  welcome it. For today, I acknowledge that we have different sectors and that  those sectors will continue to exist for the foreseeable future. However, in  that context, it is right that we continue to promote integrated schools as the  most sustainable form of education. I must say that I am not impressed by how  the Department has fulfilled its duty, which was imposed on it in 1989, to  promote integrated education. Far too often, there is a sense that integrated  schools are a further fragmentation of a fragmented system, rather than a  solution to the problem.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that we recognise that the debate is  evolving. Beyond integrated schools, there are options for shared schools,  shared campuses, joint-faith schools and simple co-operation and collaboration  between schools through, for example, the entitlement framework, and we welcome  all that. All that can be copper-fastened by policies such as sustainable  schools, area planning and, at the top of the pile, the Education and Skills  Authority. Major benefits are to be had from sharing in education: dealing with  falling rolls; preserving the local option, rather than children having to be  bussed out of small communities because the sectors want to maintain  separation; recognising the evolving identity of our society; and giving young  people the full opportunity to mix and interact with people across the board.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party does not support the SDLP amendment. On  its own, it is not that objectionable, but, in the context of the motion, it is  a clear dilution of what we are saying. For some, the difference may be like  dancing on the head of a pin. However, there are two important, subtle points  that I want to stress. First, the SDLP amendment would remove our reference to  the existing system as unsustainable, which Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s Education Minister and  spokespersons were prepared to accept. Anyone who looks objectively at our  system has to recognise that the way in which we do things is unsustainable. I  am disappointed that the SDLP amendment would remove that. The SDLP says that  it is for progress, but its members&rsquo; comments today came across as an attempt  to defend an unsustainable status quo and to hold back the tide through  rhetoric.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  have given way already, and I still have a few comments to make.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">My party and I fully support the notion of parental choice.  However, there is a danger in using parental choice as a slogan in defence of  the status quo. Let us not leave ourselves on the wrong side of the debate.  Support for parental choice is important to parents, and we will not have a  situation in which all schools are the same. There will be a whole range of  different options in education. However, we do not have the luxury of turning  choice into a fundamental right to separate sectors in our education system.  European human rights instruments, which talk about the need to recognise faith  and diversity in education, allow states the choice of doing that through a  single system or through separate sectors that they choose to fund. However,  there is no international human rights standard that states that people must  have a separate schools system and must have choice in that way.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Parental choice is an important vehicle. Throughout the  years, people in Northern    Ireland have consistently said that they  want more integrated, shared and mixed schools, but the system has not been  flexible enough to meet the demands of parents. Parents are voting with their  feet and saying that they want sharing, so let us go in that direction.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to address the comments made by Peter Robinson. The  motion is not based on what he said. The Oxford Economics report has been very  long in &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  am sorry; I have no time.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am prepared to take what was said at face value. Frankly,  if we are going to be cynical about every remark made by senior figures in this  society, we are not going to get terribly far. However, I understand why people  can sometimes be a bit suspicious. We may disagree over the precise detail of  where we are going, but that speech has sparked a debate and a sea change in  the discussion on education, and that is important.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am disappointed by the approach of the Ulster Unionists.  Again, they come across as talking the talk by saying that they support  integration, but every time they are asked to put their hands up to give their  full support to a proper integrated system, they baulk at it.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Bring your remarks to a close.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  They defend the status quo &mdash; segregation. I find that somewhat disappointing.  My time is up, so I had better leave it there.</p>

      <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="10"></a>Adjournment</p>
      <p class="H4StageHeading">Greyabbey: Sewerage System</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind Members that the proposer of the topic will have 15  minutes in which to speak, and all other Members who wish to speak will have  approximately eight minutes.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I do not think that I will take all the time allotted to me, Mr Deputy Speaker,  but I will do my best.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">My constituents in Greyabbey are very grateful to the  Business Committee for putting this debate on their desperate situation on the  Order Paper today. I am also grateful for the support of my Strangford MLA  colleagues and to Minister Murphy for attending to hear of the plight of those  unfortunate local residents.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Greyabbey is a very pleasant and historic coastal village,  halfway down the Ards   Peninsula, sitting adjacent  to Strangford Lough. The residents quite often refer to it as a forgotten  village, despite the best efforts of its elected representatives and a very  active community group. Minister Murphy visited the village with me a couple of  years ago. At that time, the deplorable condition of the upper end of Main Street in  Greyabbey was of paramount importance. Unfortunately, I have to say to Minister  Murphy that that is still the position, and nothing has been done. Roads  Service continues to wait for Northern Ireland Water (NIW) to carry out work  before it can resurface the busy Main    Street. Meanwhile, other problems arise at the  other end of Main Street,  around the local primary school and nearby private properties. There have been  very frequent sewage spills, resulting in horrible consequences for many people  in that area of Main Street.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">About 10 years ago, Greyabbey got a brand new sewerage  facility, after a lot of hard work between the Water Service, public  representatives and local residents. That facility was hailed as a success.  However, in recent times, problems have arisen around The Square and on the Portaferry Road in  Greyabbey. The experience for residents is that, when heavy rain occurs, pipes  seem to be unable to cater for the huge volume of water, and, as a result,  sewage from the plant backfills and spills out into the street, getting into  private homes and, at times, into the local primary school. That cannot be  acceptable and must be given priority immediately to prevent further  destruction of local people&rsquo;s homes and the school.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It would seem that the problem started back in May of this  year, with similar occurrences in July, August, September and October, with the  latest occurring a few weeks ago, on 7 November. I have had correspondence with  Northern Ireland Water, the Minister and the Consumer Council, all of whom have  acknowledged the serious problem. Yet every time there is heavy rainfall, the  problem occurs. The occupant of the gate lodge at the Rosemount estate, the  people in the primary school and the owners of private homes around the corner  from the school and on the Portaferry    Road are at their wits&rsquo; end. I appeal to the  Minister to insist that preventative measures are installed immediately.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have to report to the Assembly the result of what is now  called out-of-sewer flooding that occurred on 7 November, as reported by a  resident:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;On top of the usual sewage flooding into our inner  courtyard, down the lane, across the driveway and also internally into our  utility room we now have a worse problem. We have an old church&rdquo;,</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">which is adjacent to their home,</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;which we are beginning to renovate and which  currently stores many of our possessions &mdash; this is now sitting in a lake of  sewage and our possessions are now contaminated with sewage from the village &mdash;  we are unable to go outside our door without wearing wellies to wade through  the appalling effluent.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Deputy Speaker, I have photographs here, but I do not  think that I should expose them, because they are absolutely horrific. Surely  no one in this society in this day and age should have to endure that from an  adjacent sewage plant.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, I am heartened and glad to report that on 16  November &mdash; last week &mdash; Northern Ireland Water installed a non-return valve to  the sewerage connection at the property at 1 Portaferry Road. I am assured that that  will prevent sewage from flowing back up the connection when the sewers are  surcharged and spilling out of the manhole in the residents&rsquo; courtyard area. No  heavy rain has happened since that was fitted, so we await some form of success  with bated breath.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">An investigation of the wider sewerage network has been  completed in Greyabbey, and a report has been produced to identify the problems  that have been encountered. Based on the findings of the report, Northern  Ireland Water is developing a solution that will require the upgrading of the  sewerage system in the Greyabbey area and the installation of tanks at the  local waste water treatment works. It plans to take that work forward within  the current financial year. However, that means by the end of March, and we  have a long winter in front of us. I appeal to the Minister to complete that  work as soon as possible, rather than wait until the end of the financial year.  I thank Members and the Minister for their attention.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I congratulate the Member on securing today&rsquo;s Adjournment debate. I have heard  some people cruelly say that the Member talks a lot of sewage, and, for the  past six minutes, he literally has. However, in this case, it is a very real,  important and problematic situation for residents in Greyabbey. Indeed, it is  not just in that one part of the Strangford constituency or of the Ards Peninsula;  the problem is clearly evident right across the Strangford constituency and  right across Northern    Ireland, where we and the Minister&rsquo;s  Department struggle day in, day out with a legacy of underinvestment in our  water and sewerage infrastructure. We see the pressures that have built up with  development in our towns and villages and the stress and strain that it is  putting on what is, in some cases, a Victorian water and sewerage  infrastructure.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I fully support the Member&rsquo;s comments on Greyabbey. With  your indulgence and latitude, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will shamelessly exploit  this opportunity to raise other similar issues in the Strangford constituency.  I do not expect a response from the Minister on those issues today, but I would  fail in my duty if I did not avail myself of the opportunity to raise some of  them. Other Members in the House who represent the Strangford constituency will  know about these problems and will agree that they are every bit as important  to the residents in those areas as the issue that Mr McCarthy has highlighted.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to raise a handful of issues; I will skip through  them as quickly as I can. In my home town of Comber, there is simply a capacity issue &mdash;  maybe I should not say &ldquo;simply&rdquo; &mdash; in the Dermott estate, particularly around  the Dermott Green area. Like the residents in Greyabbey, every time there is  serious rain, people in that area are waiting to be flooded. As any of us  would, they have taken all sorts of measures to protect their properties, and I  commend them for that. I also commend Northern Ireland Water and Roads Service  for their work on the ground in very difficult circumstances and with, at  times, very limited resources. I commend them for their work in the Dermott  Green area of Comber, for the practical help and assistance that they have  given to residents when there has been flooding, and for the work that they  continue to do to try to solve the problem. It is a capacity issue that needs  to be addressed in that area or else those poor people will be flooded every  time there is the sort of rain that occurred last week, at Halloween or at  other parts of this year.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">5.30 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister will be familiar with the second issue, which  involves Killyleagh. For those Members who do not know, sewage is pumped from  Crossgar to Killyleagh. The wastewater treatment works in Killyleagh can deal  with the capacity, so that is not an issue, but the problem is that an  unbearable smell is produced via air vents that are sited on the Downpatrick Road in  Killyleagh. My family still lives in the area, so I know of the problem  particularly well. The longer-term solution is not air vents, and anything that  has been done to try to solve the problem has not worked. Simply, something  needs to be done at the Crossgar end to treat the waste there so that there is  not the need for pumping to Killyleagh. The problems with the smell on the Downpatrick Road  would then stop.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Thirdly and fourthly, I want to raise two separate issues,  which, in many respects, are opposite sides of the same coin. One issue has had  the effect of stopping development. The other is of too much development.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The first of those refers to Ballynahinch. I thank the  Minister for taking up the invitation to visit Ballynahinch and to speak about  various issues, which he will do this week. We have discovered that, in  Ballynahinch, there is a restriction on planning. I know that planning is not  the Minister&rsquo;s responsibility, but it is impacted on by the sewerage system.  The Planning Service says that it will not approve any further development in  the town unless the sewerage works are upgraded or unless any development has  its own wastewater treatment works. That has been the case elsewhere in Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That inhibits the ability of Ballynahinch to regenerate.  Like many towns across Northern    Ireland, it has seen better days, yet,  sitting as a gateway to the Mournes, and, as a market town for the past 400  years, it has huge potential. There are many private investors who want to  spend a lot of money in Ballynahinch and to start to regenerate the town, and  we want to welcome that. However, the ability to do that is impinged upon by  the inability to develop, coming from planning regulations, because of the lack  of capacity of the sewerage works. There has been a lack of capacity for around  a year. The investment strategy for Northern Ireland contains a  commitment to upgrade the wastewater treatment works in Ballynahinch over the  next number of years, and I urge the Department to do all that it can to ensure  that that becomes a reality so that that town can get back on its feet and help  itself to regenerate.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, I will raise an issue that relates to Saintfield  about which I have pestered the Minister and the Department for the past number  of years. I have never seen such a concentration of flooding of such huge  proportions in one small area. I will not list the streets, addresses and buildings  that it has affected, but it has affected residences and schools and has  blocked the Crossgar Road,  which is the main road between Belfast  and Downpatrick. That entire road was flooded.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There are all sorts of theories on why that has happened,  and I think that there is simply a lack of capacity in the system. Unlike  Ballynahinch, development continues in that area. When Northern Ireland Water  is consulted, it says that there is sufficient capacity in the system. I  suspect that there is sufficient capacity overall, but that one little area,  centred around the Old Grand Jury Road and Crossgar Road, seems to be  inundated. There are factors outside the main system, such as run-off from an  adjacent field, which may be having an impact on the system there. Nonetheless,  it is having a severe impact on people and on properties in that area.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In seeking to solve all those problems, the entirety of the  Minister&rsquo;s capital budget for the remainder of this financial year would  probably be spent. Nevertheless, those four examples underpin and underline Mr  McCarthy&rsquo;s basic point, which is that there has been an underinvestment in our  water and sewerage systems, and the people across our constituency are  suffering as a result.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Bring your remarks to a close.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I know that the Minister has been active on this issue, but I urge him to do  all that he can to help to alleviate the situations that I have outlined.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  I suspect that my Strangford colleague Kieran McCarthy MLA was bang up to date  and undoubtedly in order when he submitted this topic for debate, dualling the  sewerage system and private properties in Greyabbey, and I thank him for doing  that. However, I can report that Greyabbey people are most grateful that, in  their opinion, the complaints about the sewerage system are, to a large extent,  being dealt with, although that is not before time. That is, the problems  relating to sewerage and the development of private properties are being dealt  with.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Wednesday week ago I attended a village hall meeting called  by the Greyabbey and District Community Association. The only elected  representatives able to attend with me were Councillor Carson and Councillor  Boyle, and respective apologies were sent by those who were unable to be there.  The subject of sewers and the issue of derelict sites and unfinished  developments arose in the discussion.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The purpose of the meeting was to reveal the outcome of a  Greyabbey survey. Although I say that sewerage and private developments were  discussed, they were, in a sense, secondary items and were not reflected in the  survey that had just been taken. That is not intended to diminish Mr McCarthy&rsquo;s  Adjournment topic in any way; rather, it is just a report of the latest  situation in Greyabbey.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I see this debate as a means to introduce to the Minister  and the House the Greyabbey survey, particularly question 4, which asked, &ldquo;What  do you think of the standard of the village&rsquo;s roads?&rdquo;, and question 8, which  asked, &ldquo;If Greyabbey were to receive funding, how would you like the money to  be spent?&rdquo; The answers to those questions revealed the link to the issue of  sewers. In response to question 4 on the standard of roads, it will come as no  surprise to the Minister that 21% answered &ldquo;abysmal&rdquo;, 30% said &ldquo;horrendous&rdquo; and  45% said &ldquo;awful&rdquo;. In response to question 8, the greater majority, 43%, said  that the money should be spent on improving the roads, especially in Main Street. I do  not know whether there is any money going to Greyabbey, but that is a clear  message from the people of Greyabbey. If you have any surplus cash, Minister,  that is where they would like it spent.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In all cases, the state of the sewerage system running  below the roads was identified as being extremely poor. Perhaps &ldquo;awful&rdquo; is a  better word for the local roads. That is part and parcel of a historical and  appalling lack of joined-up thinking between the Planning Service, the Roads  Service, NI Water and developers. Indeed, it highlights the serious lack of  contact between all those people and those who count most, in my opinion: the  Greyabbey villagers.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Greyabbey and District Community Association is to be  commended for its initiative in producing its survey. I am sure that the  Minister has received a copy of the survey from his officials, because I understand  that they, too, were invited to that meeting Wednesday week ago but were unable  to attend. However, I am sure that they have familiarised themselves with the  survey. I also commend my colleague Kieran McCarthy, who is to be congratulated  for bringing this issue to the attention of the House and for allowing us, with  your permission, Mr Deputy Speaker, to broaden the debate a little bit.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Minister, in conclusion, the clear view from Greyabbey is  that they want you to prevent any further problems with the sewers. The roads  are just lousy, so, please, if you could, would you do your best to sort them  for that village? I concur with Kieran that it is, in many respects, a  forgotten village, with regard to the roads. Unfortunately, that is a common  phrase used about a lot of villages in my constituency of Strangford, which is  a constituency of villages.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Deputy Speaker, I apologise to you, the Minister and my  colleagues, because I have been double-booked, and given that this has run on,  I have to depart. I am sure that everyone is glad to hear that. I thank the  Minister for his attention and Kieran for bringing the topic to the House.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: I,  too, congratulate my colleague for bringing the topic to the House, as it is a  prescient one for the people of Greyabbey and the surrounding area. I know that  my colleague Kieran will agree that the people of Greyabbey take a real pride  in their village. Their homes, regardless of the type of property, are  immaculate; they look after their village, for which they must be commended.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I did some research with the office of Jim Shannon, Member  of Parliament, in preparation for this debate, and I know that meetings were  undertaken directly with residents and that Mr Shannon convened a group meeting  with residents and NI Water. Somewhere along the line, Mr Shannon managed to  obtain a temporary measure to alleviate some of the immediacy of Greyabbey&rsquo;s  sewage problem. It is, therefore, only proper that I put that on the record.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Minister for taking the time to come here today  to deal, not for the first time, with matters that others may not consider to  be of magnitude but which my constituents consider very important. The most  recent was a traffic-calming measure in West Street. The public in Strangford  were pleased that that issue was raised on the Floor and that the Minister took  time out of his busy schedule to meet directly about it; that was well  received. I therefore put on record my appreciation. It shows the success of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  devolved democracy. People can raise the issues that matter to them and seek  representation on them, and although they may not always get an answer  immediately, they can go directly to the accountable Minister. That is part of  our success.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will now deal directly with the issue of the sewerage  system. Raw sewage has been floating on the streets of Greyabbey, and very  small children have had to walk through it on their way to primary school in  the past number of days; I think that it was around 7 November. If we were to  ask any group of young people what century I was talking about, they would say  the Victorian period, and they would think that I was describing a village with  no sewerage structure. Sadly, that incident was due to heavy rainfall on or  around 7 November, which was out of the ordinary. Such rainfall is difficult to  prepare for, but it resulted in raw sewage reappearing on the streets of  Greyabbey, around the school, at the corner and back down to the gate-lodge.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">My colleague Mr Hamilton hit the nail on the head: we are  asking the Minister to do something about that in future; however, we recognise  that there has been systemic underinvestment in the sewerage system in Northern Ireland  generally and in Greyabbey specifically. We are, therefore, not in any way  taking part in a blame game or trying to score points. Rather, we are telling  the Minister that the situation is critical because raw sewage is on the  streets. We want a sewerage system that is fit for the twenty-first century not  to a time gone by.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Hamilton raised another issue of equal concern to an  individual in Ballywalter about 28 Main Street, where the old post office once  was. I will confirm the exact details with the Minister, but there seems to be  a problem. Whether that problem is with storm drainage, which comes under Roads  Service, or with sewage, which comes under Northern Ireland Water, either way,  the Minister has the monopoly.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">5.45 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The problem is at the corner of what was the old post  office and yard. Roads Service has looked at that and dealt with the problem by  patching it up. However, water continues to come through. Therefore, can we get  to the root of the problem in that area? Is it storm water or sewage? Whatever  it is, it is still coming through. The area has been marked to be patched again,  but I want to ensure that the issue is looked at.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As Mr McNarry slightly inaccurately put it, there was a  village meeting in Greyabbey. Unfortunately, I got notification of that at 7.30  pm. Arriving home after duties connected to the House, I was opening my mail &mdash;  it was probably 7.45 pm or 8.30 pm before I got through it all &mdash; and found an  invitation to the meeting. However, it was delivered to me on the day of the  meeting. I know that colleagues such as Simon Hamilton and others would have  been at the meeting but could not do so because they were not invited. However,  my colleague Councillor Joe Hagan, who has not been mentioned, and who has done  a lot of work in the Greyabbey area, was there. I assure people that through  our group meetings, locally and in other places, we will follow up on the  feedback from that meeting and on what Greyabbey wants and needs from Roads  Service.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In my final minute, I want to raise the issue of the road  in Greyabbey, which is a bit of a chicken-and-egg situation. Main Street is probably one of the worst  roads in any village in Northern    Ireland. However, the problem cannot be  solved until the sewerage system is dealt with. The situation is such that we  are getting numerous complaints from people who are writing to us and asking us  to do something. When one drives down the road &mdash; or bounces down it, perhaps &mdash;  one has to go through the ruts. I have to tell people that nothing can be done  about the road until the sewerage system is sorted out, because Roads Service  will not work on it until then.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is a need for some level of joined-up government. I  bring that to the Minister&rsquo;s attention and thank him for his presence and  interest in these matters.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development (Mr Murphy)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann  Comhairle. I am pleased to be able to come to the Chamber today and respond to  the debate tabled by Mr McCarthy. As he will know, I am aware that there are  ongoing problems affecting the sewerage system in the Greyabbey area and that  out-of-sewer flooding has occurred in the village. I appreciate his frustration  and that of other Members with the flooding and with the development of the  work needed to resolve the issue once and for all.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Flooding is a very distressful occurrence for businesses  and residential properties. However, the involvement of sewage adds enormously  to that distress. I very much appreciate the frustration felt by the residents  of Greyabbey.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In conjunction with the NIEA (Northern Ireland Environment  Agency), NIW has identified a scheme to resolve the problem by upgrading the  sewerage system in the village and carrying out improvements to the local waste  water treatment works. The sewer from Main    Street to the waste water treatment works will be  upgraded to prevent a recurrence of the flooding at the rear of the Wildfowler  Inn restaurant, and two combined storm water overflows on Main Street will be abandoned. The sewer  serving Mill Lane  will also be upgraded and new tanks will be installed at the treatment works.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The need to upgrade the sewer serving the Newtownards Road  and the Carrowdore Road  has also been identified. The scheme is presently at design stage but requires  some additional CCTV analysis of the sewerage system to confirm what is  anticipated to be a significant infiltration of groundwater into sewers at a  number of locations.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate that people want that scheme to happen  yesterday. However, it is important, while we are developing it, that we do so  correctly. That is not to drag things out or drag our heels. A certain amount  of silting and groundwater infiltration has been identified at a number of  locations. If those things are not fixed as part of the overall scheme, we will  store up problems for the future, so it is important to take time to get this  right.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is possible that the CCTV survey will identify the need  for additional remedial work to be carried out on the system. However, NIW  remains confident that work will commence in the current financial year and  will be completed next year. Additional de-silting work has been identified for  the sewer lines on Newtownards    Road, Main    Street and The Square in Greyabbey as part of  normal operational activity, and that work will be ongoing.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A number of Members raised issues during the debate, and,  if I leave out any detail in my response, I will write to them. Mr Hamilton  raised the issue of the sewers in Dermott    Drive in Comber. NIW is aware of that issue, and a  scheme has been developed to resolve it. He also mentioned Ballynahinch, and  NIW has identified a scheme to address the lack of capacity in and around  Ballynahinch, which will, hopefully, have an impact on the ability to grant  planning approvals.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am disappointed that there are ongoing problems in Killyleagh.  I think that the first site meeting that I was invited to after taking up the  position of Minister for Regional Development was at Killyleagh, at the  invitation of Jim Shannon. An odour problem was identified. I know that there  have been attempts to deal with the problem, and I am disappointed that they  have not been successful. I will raise that issue again with NIW, as I will the  issue in Saintfield that Mr Hamilton mentioned. I will certainly get back to  him on that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate that David McNarry had to leave. He spoke  about the survey that was carried out by Greyabbey residents. I have not  received that survey yet, but I will have a look at it and take into account  the feelings of the residents there. I understand that people are frustrated by  what they consider to be substandard infrastructure. Members have acknowledged  that we are playing catch-up to a substantial degree with our sewerage, water  and road infrastructures. Even with restricted budgets, we will try to ensure  that, where possible, we improve infrastructure as we go along.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Jonathan Bell raised issues about Ballywalter, and I will  have to get back to him in writing. He also raised the issue of the sewers in Greyabbey Main Street.  Obviously, the identification of the solution to the sewage problem has taken  some time as there has to be design and analysis of what is required. It would  probably be inappropriate or unwise for Roads Service to get involved in a  substantial area of work on Main Street while there is be a possibility that  the street will need to be dug up to accommodate required sewage works. It is  always the case that Roads Service will hold back until sewerage work is  completed, and the intention is for that work to be started in the next couple  of months and finished a couple of months thereafter. I had the opportunity to  travel through Greyabbey to see the road surface myself, and I concur that it  is not of a standard that people would like to see. I understand that Roads  Service would want to hold back until the NIW work is completed, and I  anticipate that it will want to revisit that, depending on its budget.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Some would say that those issues are not the biggest in the  world, but they are pressing issues for the Strangford constituency and the village of Greyabbey. I am happy to be able to  provide some information. I hope that people are satisfied that there is a  serious effort ongoing to tackle the situation in Greyabbey and that  out-of-sewer flooding is considered a serious issue. We must ensure that we get  the right system in place so that we do have to revisit it in a couple of years  and have people asking why we did not put the proper system in place when we  did the work in the first place. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure that all  of the studies are carried out. However, there is a sense of urgency on the  issue from NIW, and it intends to start the work in the next couple of months.  I hope that that gives Members some encouragement. We will come back to the  range of other issues in due course.</p>
