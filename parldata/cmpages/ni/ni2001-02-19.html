                the First Minister rose on a point of order on a matter relating
                to the Civic Forum. You stated that you would be prepared to
                consider the issue and that papers should be furnished to you. I
                know that I have done so. Can you confirm that the First
                Minister has done so? In assessing the status of the meeting of
                the Civic Forum on 20 December, I ask you to pay special
                attention to an e-mail sent from the Office of the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister at 15.20 on that day,
                which referred to the meeting that was taking place at Balmoral.

                a meeting of the Civic Forum, did not step forward to hand over

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the benefit of Members, I will summarise
                the reasons for introducing the Bill and its main provisions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The collection of wild shellfish from the
                shores of Stangford Lough for commercial purposes has been
                increasing in recent years. Conservationists have raised
                concerns about the likely impact of that on the foreshore’s
                wildlife. Powers to regulate fishing activity on the foreshore
                are not currently available in Northern Ireland, and changes to
                existing fisheries legislation were therefore deemed necessary
                to permit the use of fisheries regulatory powers to control the
                collection of wild shellfish from the foreshore.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was also considered necessary to amend
                existing fisheries legislation to provide fisheries regulators
                with powers to conserve and enhance the environment and to
                permit the trade and farming of salmon roe. Additionally,
                several measures in the existing legislation, relating to the
                issue of angling permits and licences had proved to be
                restrictive. The Bill amends the Fisheries Act (Northern
                Ireland) 1966 to provide the Department with powers to regulate
                fishing activity in the areas defined as Northern Ireland
                inshore waters, including the foreshore, by prohibiting fishing
                from, or by means of, vehicles or equipment of a specified
                description.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It also provides the Department with the
                power to regulate fishing activity for environmental purposes in
                line with its obligations under the EC Habitats Directive. These
                amendments will enable the Department to prohibit the use of
                mechanical harvesting equipment for collecting wild shellfish
                from the shores of Strangford Lough. They will, therefore,
                prevent damage to the wildlife that inhabits the foreshore in
                that area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill also amends several other provisions
                in the Act that relate to inland fisheries functions, which are
                the responsibility of the Department of Culture, Arts and
                Leisure. Those amendments include the removal of the prohibition
                on the trade and farming of salmon roe while retaining the
                protection of wild stocks. That will result in the removal of
                the restriction on trade in a very viable product.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill also strengthens the Fisheries
                Conservancy Board’s authority to conserve the environment by
                providing it with powers to regulate salmon fishing for
                environmental purposes. Those powers control the removal of
                material from rivers and reinstate in-river habitats that have
                been adversely affected as a result of pollution. It also
                provides the board with powers to make by-laws for the
                management and protection of fisheries and to issue angling
                licences at concessionary rates to certain categories of
                applicants, such as those with a disability.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, I thank Members for their
                contribution to the debate on the Bill and, in particular, the
                Chairman and members of the Agriculture and Rural Development
                Committee who carried out detailed scrutiny of the Bill and
                afforded my officials the opportunity to give evidence on the
                amendments. On behalf of my Colleague Mr McGimpsey, I thank the
                Chairman and members of the Culture, Arts and Leisure Committee
                for their work on those provisions in the Bill that deal with
                inland fisheries functions.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wells:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill is very welcome, and it has
                benefited from the scrutiny of the two relevant Committees. The
                grilling that the Agriculture Committee gave the officials
                impressed me, and the Bill has improved as a result. As Members
                are aware, the Bill will prevent the use of mechanical means of
                harvesting shellfish. That is a particular problem on Strangford
                Lough. I am confident of great support for the radical
                improvement in the sanctions available to the Department for
                those who deliberately pollute our waterways.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, it must be emphasised that the Bill
                will enable the Department only to make regulations to control
                those activities. Will the Minister tell us when those
                regulations will be published, for without them the Bill is
                toothless?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the regulations be subject to the
                negative or affirmative resolution of the House? That is also
                very important, because one procedure would enable the House to
                make amendments to the regulations, while the other would mean
                they would simply be rubber- stamped.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill is to be welcomed, once those
                questions are answered. Many people are involved in the
                conservation of the marine habitat of Strangford Lough and other
                coastal waters in Northern Ireland and in maintaining
                high-quality fishing facilities in our inland waterways. I am
                sure that they will all breathe a lot easier once the Bill
                receives Royal Assent.</p>

                possible following consultation, which will, of course, be very

                The regulations will be subject to negative resolution of the

                I confirm to Members who are not in the Finance and Personnel
                Committee that the 17 amendments agreed between it and me, and
                endorsed by the Assembly, in no way affect the underlying policy
                of the Bill. They do, however, improve the Bill’s operational
                effectiveness by clarifying measures such as the position of
                mortgage lenders and covenants used by the Housing Executive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The central aim of the Bill is to simplify
                the conveyancing process by facilitating the move from leasehold
                to freehold ownership of residential property. Ultimately that
                will simplify the conveyancing process by getting rid of complex
                pyramid titles, which blight so much residential property in
                urban areas. Associated policy developments are the
                computerisation of the conveyancing process and the extension of
                compulsory first registration of title to all residential
                property. These changes cannot be achieved overnight and will
                take some time. I hope that Members will be patient in that
                regard.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In due course, I will bring before the
                Assembly the necessary associated Land Registry rules and the
                draft Order that will set the multiplier.</p>

                issues at Consideration Stage about schedule&nbsp;1 and his
                proposals for calculating the multiplier. Owing to a slight
                misunderstanding between the Minister and me, we were unable to
                address those issues at Further Consideration Stage. The
                Minister has just said that a draft Order will be brought
                forward to deal with the setting of the multiplier. Would the
                Minister care to comment on any of the remarks that I made
                two&nbsp;weeks ago? Essentially, I did not feel that his
                proposal to set a multiplier of nine represented fair
                replacement investment value for the loss of a ground rent. I
                proffered different mathematical formulae that I felt would
                address that and which would raise the multiplier by two or
                three notches. Will the Minister address those issues before we
                finish with the Bill?</p>

                been aired previously, including during Consideration Stage. The
                Bill will require and allow the Minister of Finance and
                Personnel to keep the multiplier under consideration. However,
                notwithstanding Mr&nbsp;Leslie’s insights, I am not minded at
                this stage to opt for a multiplier other than nine. The advice
                that I have suggests that that is fair and reasonable and it
                would be wrong for me to tell either Mr&nbsp;Leslie or the House
                otherwise. That will be determined beyond the Bill when the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before embarking on the main debate, I wish
                to acknowledge the Finance and Personnel Committee’s
                confirmation that it has been consulted on the spending plans
                reflected in these motions. The Committee has shown keen and
                proper interest in finance issues, and I look forward to its
                further constructive and incisive involvement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The resolutions moved have two purposes. The
                first seeks the approval of the Assembly to the issue of a
                further sum of £196 million from the Consolidated Fund for the
                2000-01 financial year — as detailed in the spring
                Supplementary Estimates booklet. The second seeks the approval
                of the Assembly to the issue of a cash sum of £3,806 million on
                account for the 2001-02 financial year. It also seeks the
                authority of the Assembly for the use of resources amounting to
                £4,306 million on account in the 2001-02 financial year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will remind the Assembly about the
                significance of the resolutions for which I am seeking its
                support. These resolutions are the basis upon which the
                legislature — in the form of this Assembly — authorises the
                spending of Departments, the Assembly itself, the Northern
                Ireland Audit Office and other bodies for the carrying out of
                their various functions. One of our fundamental responsibilities
                is to authorise expenditure and to hold Departments to account
                for how the money is used. This is one of the main means that we
                have to ensure that we deliver on our agreed plans and, in due
                course, deliver the Programme for Government when it has been
                approved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The scope of the debate covers expenditure in
                both 2000-01 and 2001-02. The first of the two resolutions is
                the means by which Supplementary Estimates can be examined by
                the Assembly. This is the main means of implementing and
                confirming the decisions made by the Executive on the allocation
                of resources brought forward from 1999-2000 under the end-year
                flexibility arrangements, on the reallocation of resources
                through the in-year monitoring rounds in June, October and
                December, and on the Agenda for Government, as announced in the
                summer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second resolution is the usual means by
                which, at this point in the financial cycle, the ongoing
                commitments of Departments are authorised during the period
                between the beginning of the 2001-02 financial year and the
                presentation to the Assembly of the Main Estimates for that
                year. In general, the cash and resource amounts required on
                account have been calculated as 45% of the forecast 2001-02 Main
                Estimate requirement, based on the Budget that was agreed by the
                Executive and approved by the Assembly last December.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As its name suggests, the Vote on Account is
                not intended to seek the Assembly’s final approval of the
                allocations for 2001-02, since less than half the total proposed
                budget is being sought in the Budget Bill. It seeks sufficient
                resources and cash to allow services to proceed until the
                detailed work on the Main Estimates has been completed in the
                late spring. At that stage, there will be a full opportunity to
                deal with the details of the spending plans for 2001-02, and,
                given the switch to Resource Estimates, I propose that there
                should be prior discussion between my Department and the Finance
                and Personnel Committee on the Main Estimates over the next few
                months. Therefore for today’s purposes, I propose to focus on
                the issues relating to 2000-01, as this is the last major
                opportunity for discussion on this matter before the end of the
                financial year. It is important that I draw out for the Assembly
                some aspects of the Estimates that differ from the position on
                the Budget and the monitoring rounds.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr McClelland] in the
                Chair)</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, the Estimates include all aspects of
                departmental expenditure that are subject to appropriation under
                the cash regime and which will be subject to the authorisation
                of resources in the resource accounting regime. That means that
                they include annually managed expenditure (AME), as well as
                expenditure that falls within the departmental expenditure limit
                (DEL). Because we receive automatic adjustment of estimated
                requirements for annually managed expenditure from the Treasury
                — and must return any unrequired resources to the Treasury —
                these items are not included in the scope of the public
                expenditure monitoring rounds that we conduct and which I have
                announced on several occasions to the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main items that fall into that category
                are social security benefits, some of which are subject to
                annual appropriation or authorisation. Others are charged under
                legislation to the National Insurance fund, and hence do not
                feature in the voting process. Expenditure under the Common
                Agricultural Policy falls into the same category because it is
                fully funded by the European Agriculture Guarantee and Guidance
                Fund.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As well as those AME items, there are some
                aspects of expenditure that are nominally attached to the
                departmental expenditure limit, but that are ring-fenced by the
                Treasury. As we have no discretion in the use of those
                resources, they have also not been included in the context of
                our monitoring rounds. They include expenditure under the Peace
                I programme, and the special addition that was provided some
                years ago to cover the cost of the Moyle electricity
                interconnector.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have already mentioned that some social
                security expenditure is handled outside the voting system
                because there are standing authorisations, in the form of
                specific legislation, that allow money to be drawn from the
                Consolidated Fund, or another fund, to provide a service. A
                further example arises when a Department makes a loan under some
                statutory power. Very often, under the cash regime, the issue of
                the loan will count towards the DEL, but in some cases it will
                not need to come through the Estimates and voting system,
                because there is some standing authorisation for the making of
                loans outside the vote.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of the important sources of room to
                manoeuvre are outside the appropriation system. In particular,
                receipts from house sales are outside the Department for Social
                Development votes. The total that determines what we can do is
                the DEL, which is set by the Treasury. The house sales release
                some of that spending power, which makes it possible to afford
                an increase in the cash spending, and hence helps us to afford
                these Supplementary Estimates.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The convention is that the Estimates are not
                reduced as the year progresses, even if the Department concerned
                is clear that not all spending will be required. By their
                nature, the figures are estimates, and the sense of the
                resolution is that the Executive and the Departments are seeking
                spending authorisation up to the figure quoted in the Estimates.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Alongside the Estimates control regime, which
                operates on behalf of the Assembly, there are administrative
                controls. Decisions made by the Executive on the distribution of
                the Budget through monitoring rounds are reflected in clearly
                stated departmental expenditure limit figures for each
                Department. Those are issued following each monitoring round and
                become the cash ceiling that the Executive authorise. The system
                depends on those two controls working together, and it is a
                major function of my Department to ensure that those controls
                are brought together and that the detailed figure work is
                reconciled.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The final complication that I need to mention
                is that there can be agreed transfers of resources between
                Departments, or between Departments of the Executive and the
                Northern Ireland Office, or between Departments here and
                Departments in Whitehall. By convention, if responsibility for a
                function is transferred, the DEL spending provision transfers
                with it. In other areas, such as student support, there can be a
                need to allow resources to follow the pattern of demand on an
                agreed basis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those factors are important, because they
                affect how the figures that are discussed and set out in the
                Budget planning documents and in the monitoring rounds, are, in
                the end, reflected in the final amounts that need to be
                authorised for issue from the Consolidated Fund to cover the
                approved expenditure. That is undeniably complex, but essential
                to meet the twin requirements that we keep expenditure within
                the departmental expenditure limit, as set by the Treasury, and
                seek authorisation for no greater amount of cash expenditure
                than is set out in the Estimates.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is the first time that the Assembly has
                dealt with Supplementary Estimates. This time last year, the
                entire process of approving the Appropriation Order was dealt
                with in three hours in a Standing Committee of the House of
                Commons. This is also the last occasion on which we will seek
                appropriation of cash as the sole manifestation of Assembly
                control of expenditure. We are planning a transition to resource
                accounting and budgeting, subject to final approval of the
                Government Resources and Accounts Bill.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Main Estimates for 2000-01 were
                considered and approved by the Assembly last June. The Estimates
                provided the detailed basis for the allocation and use of
                resources for the purposes prescribed. The Estimates were
                followed by in-year monitoring rounds in June, October and
                December, as a result of which changes were made to the
                allocations. The changes were made possible by the distribution
                of additional money received from the Treasury; the revised
                treatment of rate rebates; and the redistribution of easements
                in the spending plans for certain areas, which included
                increased receipts.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The changes have been accompanied by detailed
                statements at each stage and form the basis of the details set
                out in the booklets that have been made available to Members.
                Although it was not possible to have prior consultation with the
                Finance and Personnel Committee before announcing the Executive’s
                decisions in the monitoring rounds, my officials and I have been
                available to explain the position. Apart from the late addition
                of £18 million to the budget for the Department of Health,
                Social Services and Public Safety, which was made last week,
                there has been scope for scrutiny following each monitoring
                round.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The total figure for the Supplementary
                Estimates is £195,599,000. That will be used to defray charges
                that fall due for payment during the year ending 31 March 2001.
                The detailed allocations contained in the booklet have been
                determined by Departments, following careful consideration and
                approval by the Department of Finance and Personnel.
                Departmental Ministers will be better placed than I to explain
                and justify the detail, but I will try to deal with the matters
                raised by Members. If I am unable to answer, I will refer the
                matter to the relevant Minister for more detailed consideration.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The decisions taken following the monitoring
                rounds provide a picture of how that figure of almost £196
                million is made up. For the reasons that I have given, the
                reallocated amounts do not correspond exactly to the net surplus
                figures that followed the monitoring rounds, because a number of
                technical adjustments were made at those stages. However, during
                the monitoring rounds, Departments declared £148 million as
                easements, and that figure was weighed against bids for
                additional resources totalling £418 million. There is some
                double counting in the figures for bids; bids that are
                unsuccessful in one round are likely to be repeated later.
                However, the figures help to illustrate the process, and I will
                say more about how that relates to the allocations to individual
                Departments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of the changes relate to departmental
                running costs. Restructuring costs of £9 million were met from
                resources carried forward from the previous financial year. That
                was necessary to ensure that the new Departments had sufficient
                administration resources to implement the Programme for
                Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As was the case with the approval of the Main
                Estimates last June and the agreement of the Budget for 2001-02
                in December, decisions about the allocation of resources have
                been influenced by the equality requirements set out in the
                Northern Ireland Act 1998, and the requirements of New TSN, the
                Programme for Government and the Executive programme funds. We
                must keep such considerations in mind, for they will shape
                spending strategy and will bring about the changes and
                improvements that we wish to see emerge from the significant
                resource commitments for which the Assembly is responsible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I know from the interest demonstrated by
                Members and Committees, especially the Committee for Finance and
                Personnel, that this is not a responsibility that is assumed
                lightly. As an Executive and Assembly, we have a duty to ensure
                the highest standards of propriety with regard to public
                expenditure. That is an important aspect of the authorisation,
                management and control of expenditure by the Assembly and by
                individual Departments and the bodies funded by them. The
                efficient use of resources is no less important as that is the
                means by which the greatest amount of goods and services can be
                provided for the community that we serve with the resources
                available.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those are, of course, matters in which the
                Northern Ireland Audit Office and the Public Accounts Committee
                have a particular interest. They are able to examine how public
                sector bodies perform in meeting their objectives, doing so with
                due regard to propriety and efficiency. As Minister of Finance
                and Personnel, I acknowledge the important function they
                perform. I also express my appreciation for the interest,
                proposals and work of the Committee for Finance and Personnel,
                which has been assiduous in considering financial and other
                issues, often at very short notice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Turning to the allocations for individual
                Departments, I will begin with the Department of Agriculture and
                Rural Development. In Vote A, which provides for Northern
                Ireland expenditure on national agriculture support measures, a
                net £8·1 million is sought. That includes £7·1 million for
                the special aid package, payable under the less favoured area
                compensatory allowances, and £1 million to cover higher than
                anticipated demand for the environmentally sensitive areas
                scheme. In addition, £29 million is agrimonetary compensation
                for the arable and beef sectors. That is annually managed
                expenditure outside the scope of our monitoring rounds, and is
                offset by a reduction of £3 million for less favoured area
                compensatory allowances, which will be paid from guarantee
                funds, fully funded by the Intervention Board Executive Agency.
                Agrimonetary compensation is designed to offset the effects of
                currency appreciation on agricultural support prices and
                compensation payments, which are set in euros.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Vote B, which provides for local
                agriculture support measures, a net increase of £24·8 million
                is sought. That includes £16·7 million for controlling
                outbreaks of animal diseases, including brucellosis and
                tuberculosis, which was announced in June and October
                monitoring, and £2·2 million for business and environmental
                training of farmers in less-favoured areas, most of which was
                allocated in the June round.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the Department of Culture, Arts and
                Leisure, a net increase of £7·7 million is sought in Vote A.
                That includes £2·1 million to tackle health and safety issues
                at sports grounds, £0·9 million for the completion of capital
                works for the Odyssey Millennium Landmark project, announced in
                June monitoring, and £1 million for capital investment in
                public libraries, announced in the October monitoring round.
                Other additions include provision to meet pressures from the
                Arts Council of Northern Ireland and for museums, the Northern
                Ireland Millennium Company, and to allow for essential research
                and consultancy costs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moving to the Department of Education, an
                increase of some £7·8 million is sought. There is an increase
                of £20·1 million for capital works and repairs to schools, of
                which £6·2 million was provided under the Agenda for
                Government in June monitoring. One and a half million pounds is
                being provided for primary school reading schemes, as announced
                in October monitoring, and £0·6 million is allocated to
                provide gap funding for certain EU Peace I projects, pending the
                allocation of Peace II funds — both of those additions are
                under the Agenda for Government. There are also additions of:
                £3·3 million for school fuel costs, announced in October and
                December monitoring; £1 million for the purchase of school
                buses; £1 million for energy efficiency measures; £5 million
                for the EU Peace I projects; and £0·75 million for the
                Irish-medium trust fund, recently announced in December
                monitoring. Those increases are offset principally by reduced
                requirements of £25·5 million as a result of slippage into
                2001-02 of expected spending on teachers’ pay and on
                information and communications technology provision for schools.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With respect to the Department of Enterprise,
                Trade and Investment, a token increase in vote A and a
                substantive increase in Vote B are being sought. In Vote A, a
                token £1,000 is being sought by the Industrial Development
                Board (IDB) to cover self-adjusting changes, where any increased
                requirements are offset by savings.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thus, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and
                Investment is not seeking any extra spending power at this time.
                By including a token estimate of £1,000, we are able to bring
                to the Assembly’s attention the adjustments within the
                Department’s previous total allocations that have emerged as
                the year has progressed. Those include an addition of almost £1
                million for the European peace and reconciliation programme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Vote B, which covers other economic
                support measures, such as administration, energy and
                miscellaneous services, a net increase of £12·1 million is
                required. That includes: £9·9 million carried forward from
                1999-2000 under the end-year flexibility arrangements for the
                Moyle interconnector; £6·3 million for the European Peace and
                Reconciliation Programme; and £2·5 million for expenditure on
                the Information Age Initiative, which was announced last July,
                and the venture capital fund. Some offsetting savings have been
                declared elsewhere in the Vote.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With respect to the Department of the
                Environment, a net increase of £4 million is being sought. Of
                that amount, £1·7 million is for grants to maintain historic
                buildings, which was allocated in the October and December
                monitoring rounds, and £1·4 million is for increased grants in
                support of district councils, the bulk of which was allocated in
                the October monitoring round. The remainder is in respect of
                additional costs for more road safety education officers;
                planners to progress the area plans; the full resourcing of the
                planning appeals commission; and for providing additional
                resources for environmental services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As regards the Department for Regional
                Development, a net increase of £7·7 million is being sought
                for Vote A, covering expenditure on roads, transport and other
                services. The main items are: £7·5 million for roads
                maintenance, most of which was announced in the December round;
                almost £2 million towards the capital cost of a replacement
                ferry for the Strangford ferry service; and an additional £2·6
                million for running costs in the Roads Service, provided in the
                October monitoring round.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An extra £6 million is being sought in
                respect of the railways public service obligation grants,
                announced in June, and £2·7 million for railways capital
                provided in the December monitoring round. A further £2·1
                million is needed for bus fare concessions, bus fuel duty
                rebates and rural transport. These increases are partially
                offset by a reduction of capital spending on roads, a decrease
                in public liability claims and by increased receipts.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Vote B, which covers expenditure on the
                Water Service and related services, a net increase of £5·7
                million is being sought. The main items are: £3·2 million
                allocated in the June monitoring round to meet the increased
                costs of sludge disposal; £1·7 million additional costs
                associated with flooding emergencies and the cryptosporidiosis
                outbreak during late summer 2000; and £1·6 million for running
                costs, which were provided in the October monitoring round. The
                increases are partially offset by an increase of £2·5 million
                in receipts.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As regards the Department of Higher and
                Further Education, Training and Employment, a token vote of
                £1,000 is sought in Vote A, again so that the attention of the
                Assembly can be drawn to adjustments within the Department’s
                allocations. This mainly involves an increase of £3·9 million
                for mandatory student awards provided for in the October
                monitoring round, which is offset by reduced requirements on
                student loans and from slippage for capital works at the
                Springvale campus.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Vote B, a net increase of £194,000 is
                sought. The main increase of £6·6 million is to provide gap
                funding to sustain projects under the old single programme,
                which need transitional support pending the allocation of funds
                under the Transitional Objective 1 programme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is offset by reduced requirements on
                Worktrack and other training related programmes and through
                efficiencies gained from the amalgamation of Government training
                centres with further education colleges.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the Department of Health, Social
                Services, and Public Safety, an additional net provision of
                £43·4 million is sought in Vote A for expenditure on the
                health and personal social services programme. The increases
                consolidate the additional funds made available to the Health
                Service at each monitoring round. They include £19 million
                towards winter and other hospital pressures; £7 million for
                community health and personal social services; and £3 million
                to meet commitments carried forward from last year. A further
                £18 million is now included to help eliminate the deficits of
                the health and social services trusts, as announced last week.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.15 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With respect to the Department for Social
                Development, an additional net provision of £6·2 million is
                sought in Vote A to meet the Department’s administration and
                other miscellaneous costs. That includes £10·6 million to fund
                running costs, capital, and other administration pressures in
                the Department, £4·1 million of which is to assist with the
                implementation of the welfare reform and modernisation
                programme. Most of those funds were allocated in the December
                monitoring round. The increases are offset by an increase in
                receipts of £4·4 million, mainly from the Social Security
                Agency for administrating certain services on its behalf.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Vote C, an additional net provision of
                £25·8 million is sought for expenditure on urban regeneration
                and community development, which includes £23·2 million for
                the EU peace and reconciliation programme and £2·2m for gap
                funding for the community and voluntary sector announced in the
                June monitoring round. Allocations for gap funding to other
                Departments are also included in the appropriate votes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Vote E for the Department for Social
                Development, which covers social security administered centrally
                by the Department, an additional net provision of £15·1
                million is being sought. That is mainly to reimburse the social
                fund for expenditure on cold weather payments, and increased and
                retrospective awards of winter fuel payments, most of which
                scores as annually managed expenditure. The additional
                requirements also include increases in housing benefit and
                payments into the Northern Ireland National Insurance fund.
                These increased requirements are offset by reduced expenditure
                on the independent living funds and discretionary rent
                allowances.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Finance and Personnel seeks
                an additional £8·8 million in Vote A. That includes £5·2
                million on capital expenditure for new works, resulting from the
                restructuring of Departments, which was mostly allocated in the
                June monitoring round. An additional £5·5 million is sought
                for running costs to reflect the carry-forward of end-year
                flexibility in connection with the provision of Government
                purchasing, research and statistical and legal services to other
                Departments. That increase is partly offset by increased
                receipts across the Department.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Vote B, which covers superannuation and
                other allowances, an additional £15·3 million is sought to
                cover the cost of pensions, lump sums and gratuities to former
                civil servants. The main changes to the Vote are annually
                managed expenditure items and are, therefore, not a charge on
                the departmental expenditure limit.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, an additional provision of £2·4
                million is required in Vote A by the Office of the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister. That is mainly for
                disability rights, victims, additional allocations to the EU
                peace and reconciliation programme, and administration costs.
                That deals with the resolution for the spring Supplementary
                Estimates. As I stated, I will do my best to answer any
                questions that Members may have.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second Supply resolution issues a cash
                sum of some £3,806 million to be granted on account towards the
                defraying of costs incurred by Departments and the use of
                resources totalling some £4,306 million for the same purposes
                in the year 2001-02. The cash sum and resource totals, for which
                approval are sought, represent a Vote on Account pending the
                bringing forward of the main Estimates to the Assembly in May or
                June. A Vote on Account at this point in the financial year,
                prior to the year in which the cash or resources will be used,
                has been a normal feature of Government financial management.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The need to proceed in this way arises from
                problems of timing given that, after the approval of the Budget
                in December by the Assembly, detailed work has to be undertaken
                by Departments and by the Department of Finance and Personnel to
                disaggregate and allocate resource requirements for individual
                purposes, often through very narrowly defined line entries. It
                is to be hoped that this helps Members to appreciate further why
                it was necessary to seek the completion of the Budget stage of
                the process before Christmas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I draw the Assembly’s attention to an
                important innovation in the way in which the Vote on Account is
                presented. For the first time, it will reflect not only the
                allocation of cash to Departments but an allocation, up to a
                limit, for the use of resources. I drew the attention of the
                Assembly to this first allocation of resources based on resource
                budgeting in my statement on Budget proposals in October 2000.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Vote on Account will see the first
                implementation of that approach, which will have important
                consequences in ensuring that assets are properly valued and
                that the full resource cost of expenditure can be brought into
                account. That in turn will involve much more attention being
                directed to the setting of targets, measurement of outputs and
                the attribution of resources to the achievement of the
                objectives for which they were originally intended.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Government Resources and Accounts Bill,
                which is currently under consideration by the Assembly, provides
                for the necessary changes in financial measures to support the
                introduction of resource accounting and budgeting and to secure
                the authority and control of the Assembly in relation to the use
                of resources, in similar terms to those which exist for cash
                allocations. Those changes are important, though largely
                technical, and will also impact on the Budget Bill that I
                introduced earlier today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Vote on Account will fund Departments to
                implement the ongoing programmes and services for which they are
                responsible and which formed part of the Budget decisions taken
                in December 2000. There will be an opportunity for a full debate
                on the detail when the Main Estimates are finalised in June.
                This is the first Budget for which the Assembly has been solely
                responsible and, therefore, the first opportunity to begin to
                apply our collective judgement to the priorities and to the
                social and economic outcomes that we wish to achieve through
                public expenditure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have established several important
                cornerstones upon which we wish to build our policies and
                develop our thinking further. These include, of course, the
                equality considerations to which we must have regard,
                recognition of need through New TSN, the Programme for
                Government and the priority areas and initiatives that will
                attract additional funding through the Executive programme
                funds.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In commending these resolutions to the
                Assembly, it is right that we should pause to recognise the
                importance of being able to make these decisions in a devolved
                Assembly for the first time for a complete financial year. It is
                also appropriate, as I noted in the context of the Supplementary
                Estimates resolution, that we ensure appropriate levels of
                management and control over the use of these resources. We must
                be seen to use them with maximum effect to ensure the highest
                quality and greatest range of services possible for the citizens
                of Northern Ireland.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Finance and Personnel
                Committee (Mr Molloy):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.
                I welcome the Minister’s detailed statement on the Budget and
                the Supplementary Estimates. It is important to note that we
                have £196 million made available to the Department in the
                current year, either through reallocation or as a result of
                additional funds provided by the Chancellor.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the allocations made to the various
                Departments. We have discussed those on previous occasions. In
                particular, I note the issue of funds to health, education and
                infrastructure, as well as the important role that we have in
                rebuilding the failures of the past. Several services have been
                underfunded to the extent that they have been deprived and, in
                some cases, are falling apart. It is important to note the
                change and restructuring taking place and that the money will be
                available for that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcomed the Minister’s previous
                announcement about a reduction in the increase in regional
                rates. That will take some pressure off rural areas and small
                businesses. The Finance and Personnel Committee suggested a
                reduction in the increase in domestic rates and it’s members
                would have welcomed that. However, it is not possible at
                present. Will the Minister continue to re-examine the rates as a
                means of tax raising? Could we consider alternatives? The rating
                system is an unfair way of collecting tax and it has a
                detrimental effect on communities, especially the business
                community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the past, the Finance and Personnel
                Committee expressed concern about the absence of consultation
                with Committees prior to the allocation of funds through the
                monitoring rounds. At present, the reallocations are presented
                to the Assembly as a fait accompli, giving Committees no
                opportunity to influence the outcome. It is important that
                Committees have an opportunity to put forward suggestions, and
                they should have an opportunity to discuss with and present
                their views to Departments for future monitoring rounds.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There should be a revised arrangement in
                which the Department of Finance and Personnel anticipates the
                likelihood of additional money. That anticipation should be put
                to the Committees for discussion so that they can have an
                opportunity to influence Ministers before the Executive make the
                final decisions on the reallocation of money. In that way, there
                would be more collective responsibility in how money is
                reallocated. The Executive may not take the Committees’
                opinions fully on board, but they must be involved in the
                discussions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the introduction of the Vote on
                Account as a means of ensuring that the Departments’ work will
                continue while the main estimates for 2001-02 are being
                considered and adopted by the Assembly. It should be noted that
                the new practice has been adopted by the Department of Finance
                and Personnel exceptionally when the Vote on Account has been
                calculated at 45% of the incoming Main Estimate rather than
                being based on the previous year’s Estimate. That will provide
                a larger sum than normal for Departments. The change has been
                made necessary because of the complications arising from the
                introduction of resource accounting. Will the Department revert
                to the former practice or will it continue with the new
                practice?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When reporting on the Budget proposals in
                November, the Finance and Personnel Committee mentioned some
                measures that must be taken to reassess the application of the
                Barnett formula. The Barnett formula fails to address the issues
                relating to the present infrastructure deficit, the low
                population deficit, the population of regions — east and west
                — and the need to follow social deprivation to target that
                social depravation and need. The Barnett formula — for it is
                simply a population head count — does not have the ability to
                do that. Will the Minister involve the Committee in discussions
                to review the Barnett formula, and possibly look to a
                co-ordinated approach with the Scottish Parliament, the Welsh
                Assembly and the British Parliament? A co-ordinated approach
                would be of benefit to everyone. Targeting need is an issue that
                must be examined.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive Committee should press ahead
                with the structure of a staffing review of the Civil Service to
                obtain the maximum possible levels of efficiency and value for
                money in the future.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.30 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister should seek to impress upon his
                Colleagues in the Executive Committee that Assembly Committees
                ought to be engaged at the earliest stage of the preparation of
                the 2002-03 Estimates. The first consultation should take place
                before Departments submit their initial bids to the Department
                of Finance and Personnel for consideration in spring and early
                summer. That would enable Statutory Committees to respond
                quickly and effectively to the draft Budget proposal when it is
                presented to the Assembly. We suggested that the draft Budget
                proposal should be the first item of business for the new
                session in September. That would be the new means for working
                out the financial year. If Committees were consulted in advance
                we would have a free-flowing consultation, which would avoid
                people feeling that they do not have time to discuss these
                subjects fully. If all Committees and Ministers were involved,
                everyone would be better informed and consulted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister and his Colleagues in the
                Executive should continue to ensure that targeting social need
                and other work to address deprivation are given high priority.
                The Minister said that he would continue to ensure that that
                happens. All possible steps should be taken to maximise the
                benefits gained by European funding. The Minister referred to
                gap funding and the new round of European funding. The new round
                of European funding should be allocated as quickly as possible.

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Higher and Further
                Education, Training and Employment Committee (Dr Birnie): </p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></b>I congratulate the Minister on an
                intricate presentation in which he observed Charles Dickens’s
                advice, which he put in the mouth of Mr&nbsp;Micawber, about
                keeping his expenditure limits just within the size of his
                income. Overall, the Northern&nbsp;Ireland Budget will now do
                that for the remainder of the financial year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On behalf of the Higher and Further
                Education, Training and Employment Committee I will concentrate
                on the Supplementary Estimates and raise several points on the
                basis of some of the more significant changes in the pattern of
                expenditure in our Department.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, an additional £0·5&nbsp;million has
                been allocated in Vote A for increased administrative costs, and
                £100,000 of that are extra devolution-related costs. Also,
                £200,000 has been allocated for improved computer systems for
                student awards, and £161,000 has been allocated for the
                administration of New Deal. My point is not necessarily that
                such extra administration is wrong — it may well be needed —
                but that all additional administration costs must be carefully
                justified.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, a further £135,000 has been
                transferred to the Northern&nbsp;Ireland Credit Accumulation and
                Transfer Scheme (NICATS), which recently gave evidence to my
                Committee. On the basis of what we heard of its work, we welcome
                the additional resources for NICATS. We note the progress that
                it has made on a vertically and horizontally progressive system
                of qualifications. It seems to be ahead of the game with respect
                to its counterparts in other parts of the United&nbsp;Kingdom.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thirdly, the Committee recognises the
                increased provision of roughly £4&nbsp;million for mandatory
                student awards, and the Minister hinted that that is a
                demand-led expenditure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moving to Vote&nbsp;B for the Department of
                Higher and Further Education, Training and Employment, we see an
                increased provision of almost £1·5&nbsp;million for
                administration costs associated with devolution and some
                information technology costs relating to private finance
                initiatives (PFI). There are obviously issues, in principle,
                relating to the pros and cons of PFI, which we may return to in
                a subsequent debate. We recognise that if there is to be PFI
                then the IT systems should be as good as possible — we trust
                that there will be sound purchasing of IT systems.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On Vote B for the Department, we note the
                reduced requirement of about one third of a million pounds
                because of a lower than expected uptake on the Department’s
                management development programme. As a Committee, especially
                given our priorities with respect to upgrading human capital in
                the Northern Ireland labour force, at face value we have
                concerns about that. It is obviously a case of demand-led
                expenditure — the Department can take horses to water, as it
                were, but it cannot force them to drink. Nevertheless, it should
                concern us all that in the Northern Ireland economy — despite
                the fact that there are some excellent and world-class
                management teams — there are cases of Northern Ireland firms,
                whether in the manufacturing or service sectors, in which
                management over the years has lacked imagination and sufficient
                international experience. That may explain some relatively
                recent job losses. I, therefore, put down a marker relating to
                the lower than expected uptake on that management development
                programme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, we note a reduced requirement of
                almost £4 million on the Worktrack programme because of a lower
                than expected uptake. We wonder what is going on there. The more
                optimistic scenario is that it reflects the reduction in
                long-term unemployment in the Province. However, we want to be
                realistic, and there may be more pessimistic interpretations on
                why the uptake of Worktrack has been lower than expected.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion on the Supplementary
                Estimates. We trust that the concerns that I have raised on
                behalf of the Committee will be dealt with appropriately by
                either the Finance Minister or his Colleague, the Minister of
                Higher and Further Education, Training and Employment.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Lewsley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the first native Budget that allows
                the Executive and the Assembly to work together on budget
                allocations. I appreciate the Minister’s handling of these
                affairs. He has shown that he has tried to be fair and equitable
                to everyone. We have seen, through the Executive programme
                funds, that Departments have the opportunity to discontinue
                their current patterns. It is not about the Departments
                extending them and rolling them over, but about standing at the
                crossroads and seeing how they can redirect or prioritise many
                aspects of their expenditure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is now the opportunity for new
                innovation and for Departments, in particular, to become more
                proactive, rather than reactive, with their budgets. That can be
                seen by the increases reflected in the new allocations to
                Departments relating to the December, and other recent,
                monitoring rounds.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Children Fund, the consultation on a
                commissioner for children, the £2 million set aside for gap
                funding, and free transport for the elderly are just a few
                examples of the innovation that we hope to see more of in the
                future. We have seen an extra £273,000 allocated to the Office
                of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister for
                disability rights, victims and research. That is a welcome move
                in creating a more fair and equitable society for everyone in
                Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On departmental priorities, the Department of
                Health, Social Services and Public Safety has been given extra
                resources to tackle the deficits in the health trusts. It has
                been given gap funding for the community and voluntary sector.
                It is to be hoped that the £100,000 taken out of the mental
                health budget, especially in the Down Lisburn Trust area, can be
                returned to the mental health budget and services sooner rather
                than later. I hope that that will be seen as a priority. That is
                one area where we could see a real change in people’s quality
                of life and, considering the huge increase in the number of
                suicides among young men, in the long term, save many lives.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must consider the £360,000 allocated to
                essential repairs to classrooms. How will that be allocated by
                the Department? Considering the current number of ancient mobile
                classrooms which must be repaired, how will that money be
                prioritised? Is that throwing good money after bad? Should we be
                attempting to repair them, or should we be replacing them so
                that we will be saving money in the long term? What effect do
                they have on our pupils, especially with regard to their
                performance and their health and safety?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What value for money will we get from the
                £465,000 allocated for post-primary consultation, known to many
                of us as the Burns review? What will the outcome of that review
                be? Will it simply tell us what Prof Gallagher has already told
                us — that the 11-plus and selection must be scrapped? Will it
                make a recommendation about what our post-primary education
                system should be? Should we be changing it completely or keeping
                our grammar and secondary education systems? Further down the
                line, after the Burns review, will we be told that we need
                another large amount of money to go into consultation with
                regard to secondary education?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although I have had some reservations about
                the Departments’ expenditures, the main issue for me is that
                I, as an Assembly Member, have the opportunity in the House to
                approach a local Minister, who is available to listen and take
                on board my points of view on a local funding issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My final point is to do with the Government’s
                resource accounting budget, which gives the opportunity for
                transparency, accountability and, more importantly, feedback to
                the Assembly. That clearly illustrates the true cost of running
                Departments and has the effect of improving the financial
                management of the Exchequer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support these motions.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate the Minister on the delivery
                of his speech. He outlined how the money is to be spent, clearly
                and concisely, and I appreciate that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Almost £8&nbsp;million has been added to the
                Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure’s budget, of which
                more than £1 million is to be allocated to capital spending on
                libraries. That means that £2·5&nbsp;million is to be spent on
                library provision. Once again I must mention library provision
                in Lisburn. For the past 25&nbsp;years, there has been
                insufficient library provision there. Other towns, such as
                Portadown and Strabane, have jumped the list and moved ahead of
                Lisburn, and I challenge the Minister to look seriously at that
                issue again. We have heard a great deal of talk about private
                finance initiatives, but clearly those are not suitable for this
                project. Lagan Valley residents will not tolerate the Minister’s
                trying to fob us off with private finance initiatives in respect
                of that issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An extra £25&nbsp;million has been allocated
                to the agriculture budget. That is a large additional amount of
                money, but it will make little difference to farmers. There has
                been a lack of innovation on the part of the Department of
                Agriculture and Rural Development officials, and, to a greater
                extent, the Minister is singing from the same hymn sheet as the
                direct-rule Ministers were. There was an opportunity to
                introduce animal welfare and environmental grants schemes, which
                would have been similar to the old sub-programme for agriculture
                and rural development (SPARD) scheme. That would have helped
                farmers to afford improvements. Not only are farmers’ incomes
                decreasing each year, but farms are running down and
                deteriorating as the years go on. There has been an opportunity
                for the Minister to do something about this, but so far she has
                failed. We will continue to challenge the Minister on those
                issues in the coming year.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.45 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am a member of the Environment Committee,
                and the Department of the Environment has received an extra £4
                million. Steady progress has been made by the Environment
                Committee and the Minister of the Environment. I especially
                welcome the £1·7 million that has been allocated for historic
                buildings. That will release matching funding from the Heritage
                Lottery Fund, thereby bringing money to the Province. Those who
                appreciate our built heritage will also appreciate the extra
                money.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The extra money for road safety officers and
                for the Planning Service is most welcome. However, the Committee
                is still concerned about the Environment and Heritage Service.
                There is not yet sufficient funding to carry through much of the
                work that is demanded of it by the European Union. Those issues
                must be addressed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am concerned that the Minister of Education
                continues to allocate money to pet projects such as his
                Irish-medium education fund. There is clearly not a large demand
                for it. There is a large demand for new schools and new
                classrooms for the children. There are children in mobile
                classrooms in conditions that they do not deserve to be in, and
                the Minister does not appear to prioritise his money to that
                end.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Enterprise, Trade and
                Investment does not seem to spread tourism funding evenly across
                the Province. The figures speak for themselves. Certain areas
                receive sufficient funding for tourism while other areas receive
                negligible funding. The moratorium on grants outside the Greater
                Belfast area goes against Lisburn, Newtownabbey, North Down, and
                other council areas. Those areas do not have decent hotels,
                because no one wants to put in the full funding while grants are
                available in Belfast city centre. The Minister must reconsider
                that..</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The gas pipeline to the south-east of the
                Province is not getting much of a hearing. All efforts seem to
                be put into the gas pipeline to the north-west — and that is
                fair enough. However, a large amount of business is done in
                towns in the south-east of the Province, such as Dromore,
                Banbridge, Craigavon, Portadown and Newry, and a large number of
                people live in those areas. The gas pipeline to that area is
                equally as important as the pipeline to the north-west of the
                Province.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Turning to the Estimates for the Department
                for Regional Development, I would like to mention the Antrim-Knockmore
                railway line. An extra £20 million has been allocated to the
                railways. That £20 million, and a lot more, is needed to make
                the railways safe. Part of the initial AD Lyttle report
                suggested the closure of the Antrim-Knockmore railway line. It
                will cost £428,000 to buy replacement buses and to fence off
                the lineand an additional £246,000 per year will be needed to
                subsidise the bus routes on that line.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask the Ministers concerned to look at the
                value of the railways to Northern Ireland and the value of that
                line in the context of the regional strategic framework and find
                the resources to keep it open. Closing it would be a retrograde
                step. When railway lines are closed, they are closed for good,
                with the exception of Bleach Green, which is opening again after
                20 years. In this day and age, we are meant to be seeking safer
                and more environmentally friendly methods of transporting
                people. The Assembly would be sending out the wrong message if
                it closed any further railway lines.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the additional funding for
                maintaining roads. A little in a large pot is required. When
                some representatives of the Department for Regional Development
                came before our district council they said that there is not
                enough funding in the maintenance budget to resurface some roads
                for at least 100 years. If we are going to have to wait
                100&nbsp;years for some roads to be resurfaced, they will be in
                a very poor state. We cannot continue to ignore the state of our
                roads — we all use them. Sufficient funding must be put into
                the roads budget, especially for roads in rural areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Health, Social Services and
                Public Safety received £43·5&nbsp;million. I would like to see
                a large amount of funding going to the Health Service if it
                resulted in more hip operations taking place, or in people not
                having to wait so long for open-heart surgery. I do not like to
                see the wastage that is in the Health Service, and I am
                concerned about it. I do not like to see the wastage that occurs
                in the preparation of documents in Irish, in prescription fraud
                and in theft from hospitals. I challenge the Department of
                Health, Social Services and Public Safety to consider how it
                could save and reallocate money according to the real needs of
                the people and not just carry on as things are at the moment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department for Social Development
                received an extra £6·2&nbsp;million. Historically, much of its
                funding for urban regeneration has gone to Belfast and
                Londonderry, but there are many other important towns in the
                Province which would like to see a bit more of that funding
                coming their way. People in those towns feel that they have been
                hard done by over the years, and the Minister for Social
                Development has the opportunity to address that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Finance and Personnel
                discussed rates. We should be looking at a situation where the
                out-of-town shopping centres should be charged higher rates than
                those paid by shops in town centres. Businesses in town centres
                are not working on a level playing field, because out-of-town
                shopping centres have free car parking. The rateable valuation
                of out-of-town shopping centres should be increased to allow
                town centre businesses to compete. I am concerned that, while
                many of our towns and villages are boarding up their shops,
                large shopping centres are being constructed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am concerned at the increasing departmental
                running costs of the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy
                First Ministers (OFMDFM) — now over £11&nbsp;million, which
                is an increase of £239,000. That Department is top-heavy, with
                a lot of under-secretaries and high-grade civil servants.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While extra money was being allocated to
                OFMDFM, the funding for victims was not receiving its full
                allocation. Less than half of the amount sought was received,
                and only £500,000 was sought in the first instance. I quote
                from the draft Programme for Government:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;as an important part of addressing
                human rights, it is important that special attention is paid to
                the needs of those who have been most directly affected by the
                violence of the last 30&nbsp;years. The needs of victims and
                survivors are complex, ranging from coping with serious injury
                through to physical and emotional trauma, along with dealing
                with often adverse economic circumstances.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must look seriously at finding a
                reasonable amount of money to try to meet the needs of victims.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Community Relations Council receives
                almost £6 million. At some stage that funding must be looked
                at. There is less violence than previously in Northern Ireland,
                but we certainly do not have good community relations.
                Substantial funding has gone into community relations in the
                last 10 to 15&nbsp;years. One must ask if community relations
                are better or if any significant difference has been made. It
                must be decided whether the money which is put to that purpose
                is well spent.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also want to raise the issue of electronic
                government. No resources have been allocated to that, but a wish
                list has been set out. None of the desired achievements will be
                possible, however, without adequate resources.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Maskey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, Mr Deputy Speaker. I
                want to be brief. I do not want to go into the Estimates
                Department by Department, for I want a time to come when each
                Committee can deal with those aspects of the Estimates that are
                relevant to its Department. That would be the best way to
                proceed in the future, and I know that the Minister has
                addressed that very issue himself. It would perhaps take away
                some of the need for people to itemise issues in the Chamber. I
                do not want to deal with any specific items myself.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to deal with the overall
                question of public financing. There has been a learning curve in
                the Assembly and the Executive, and a lot of work has been
                required. There has been the negotiation of the Programme for
                Government, the Budget, and so on. That has been crucial work,
                and I commend the Minister, and the Executive, for having
                produced everything that has been done so far.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to have a much more wide-ranging
                debate, though obviously not today. I want to flag up the need
                to have an overview. When I raised the question of the regional
                rate recently, I made the point that I wanted to reduce it to
                the level of inflation for one year to allow time for a much
                wider overview of it. We have looked at the Barnett formula.
                There is no doubt that this area has not been dealt with
                favourably under the Barnett formula, and there is a need to
                look at it. Mr Molloy and others have already raised that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is the question of the Executive
                programme funds. How do we allocate money for targeting social
                need? We are consistently told that that is a theme. It is
                Government policy and a requirement of the Good Friday
                Agreement, but we do not, in my view, appear to take it
                seriously enough. That is not a reflection on any of the
                Ministers, of course, but we are not getting proper details of
                the way in which we deal with targeting social need and how we
                deploy money. I know that it is not only money which has to be
                deployed to target social need, but there is obviously a
                significant consequence for the overall finances if we do deal
                with targeting social need in the way in which people expect us
                to.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is of course the matter of European
                money. There are the vexed matters of private finance
                initiatives (PFI) and public-sector borrowing. I welcome the
                fact that the Finance and Personnel Committee has now launched a
                public inquiry into the use of PFI. It is clear that PFI appears
                to underpin a good deal of the work and aspirations of the
                Executive. There is a compelling and growing body of evidence
                that the PFI schemes of the past were not necessarily that
                successful. The key question — that of having important public
                services remaining in public ownership — must be addressed by
                the Assembly. I advocate that we try to map out some time for
                the Assembly to debate the overall question of public financing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also have to deal with the cross-border
                tax variations and, as I see it — as, indeed, do many
                economists who are not Nationalists or Republicans — the need
                for a single-island economy. I am drawing attention to the need
                for a full, public debate on public financing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the public service agreements and
                the Minister’s Government Resources and Accounts Bill. Those
                are ways by which we can measure public spending better and more
                effectively. As I said to some officials recently, it is
                important that public service agreements are established. They
                detail and highlight what is being financed. The Department must
                bear in mind that the contrary is also true. They also identify
                what is not being financed. They therefore help to make all the
                parties, the Executive and the Assembly as a whole more
                accountable to the public.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to echo one of the earlier
                comments. We need to take time to perform our duties in the
                Executive and the Assembly, but we also need to think in more
                imaginative terms as time goes on. We do not need the carry-on
                and carry-over policies that some Departments have unfortunately
                been carrying out. There is a need for innovation and
                imagination. There is a need — and I know that the Minister
                has addressed this in recent debates — for us to take stock
                and to have an overall view of public financing and the
                responsibilities that we all have.</p>

                </i><b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Close:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend Mr Micawber, sorry: the Minister,
                for his detailed presentation. I am sure that I am not the only
                Member who recognises the many frailties of our understanding of
                the complexities of the cycle of public expenditure. Each
                opportunity presented to us should be used as a chance to learn,
                as we try to get to grips with what is perhaps the most
                important subject for debate in this Chamber. After all, this
                issue affects every man, woman and child in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having expressed my compliments to the
                Minister, I will now take a more traditional route and express
                yet again my deep disappointment at the lack of time that has
                been made available to Members, Committees and those who are not
                on Committees to carry out a proper scrutiny of these spring
                Supplementary Estimates. Last year the Minister referred to the
                tight time schedule, and the record will show that he said that
                this restriction was unacceptable and that improvements were
                needed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One year on, one must question how much has
                really changed. I concede that, over the last six to nine
                months, there has been an opportunity to see the figures
                produced in the monitoring rounds. But, as I pointed out to the
                House, that happened retrospectively. The Committees saw the
                figures after the job was done. We have been asked to accept a
                fait accompli. I question, as I have done in the past, whether
                that constitutes proper scrutiny. In my book it does not. The
                advice that each Committee member is required to give to the
                Minister on the financial exercise should be taken on board
                before the matter goes before the Executive. We have not yet got
                that right.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I echo the sentiments of Mr&nbsp;Maskey, who
                said that we need to sit down and find a set of procedures that
                suits what we want to do on behalf of the tax-payers, our
                electorate. Our focus should on be on trying to meet time
                barriers. We must reorganise ourselves in such a way as to give
                us the time we need to do the job for which we were elected.
                Scrutiny, as I have said before, means examining in minute
                detail. It is a totally different concept from consultation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It strikes me that at the minute we are still
                operating on a consultative basis — &quot;Let us have a wee
                word with the Committee; let us have a wee word with Members,
                see what they think, and then proceed to do what the Executive
                want.&quot; I am sorry, but that is not acceptable. That must
                change. I am not trying to be negative; I am trying to be
                positive. I am trying to bring about, with other Members,
                something that has never happened before, a situation in which
                we, as accountable representatives, have the necessary knowledge
                to enable us to explain things, as necessary, and to enable us
                to ensure that money is spent in the most efficient and
                transparent manner possible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To highlight this, last year the spring
                Supplementary Estimates documents were available on
                approximately 17&nbsp;February. Today is 19&nbsp;February. Is
                that progress? What additional time and opportunities have been
                given to us? We need to look very seriously at this. If I were a
                suspicious person I would be concluding that the concept of
                scrutiny may be something that is slightly bothersome to some
                people. I would not like to leave the Chamber with that
                sentiment. Scrutiny is important; it is essential, and we must
                create the circumstances and allocate enough time for it. We
                must be about accountability and transparency. I live in hope
                that that will happen sooner rather than later.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to make some general comments on
                the spring Supplementaries. I apologise in advance if some of my
                comments or questions appear silly to some people. I am trying
                to get to grips with the overall situation, and one must often
                ask silly questions to get the correct answers. I take comfort
                from the fact that even the Minister referred to the
                complexities of the subject. Therefore, I suppose, I can claim
                that ignorance is bliss.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Looking at the overall figure of the
                Supplementary Estimate provision, I note that an additional
                £195 million is being sought. That represents approximately
                2.5% of the main Estimates. The figure sought last year was not
                a hound’s gowl from that in percentage terms.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is 2·5% of the Main Estimate the size of
                provision normally sought through the spring Supplementaries? If
                that is the case and things are budgeted so that we get an
                additional 2·5% through the Supplementary Estimates, it begs
                certain questions about some of the votes. For example, 50% is
                being sought for national agricultural support. Why is that? Has
                there been particularly bad budgeting, or do we just stick a
                notional figure in the original Estimates? Bids have included a
                10% increase for culture, arts and leisure; 40% for urban
                regeneration under the Department for Social Development; 8% for
                finance and personnel; and an additional 7% for the Office of
                the First and the Deputy First Minister. Interestingly, over
                100% of an increase has been requested for superannuation and
                other allowances. The Main Estimates provision was over
                £14&nbsp;million; now they are seeking £15·2&nbsp;million to
                bring the total amount to £29·3 million.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must study and query those bids. Do they
                follow some general policy? Comparison with last year’s
                supplementaries certainly gives credence to that view. For
                example, last year an additional £10 million was sought for
                national agricultural support; this year it is an additional £8
                million. The IDB bid last year was for a token amount; ditto
                this year. The Finance and Personnel bid was for £8·7 last
                year and for £7·7 million this year. Last year, an additional
                £3·4 million was sought for the Northern Ireland Statistics
                Research Agency’s running costs; the figure for this year is
                £3·5 million.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those similarities pose the question: is it
                anticipated that top-ups will always be available? Having
                pointed to the similarities, I must mention some exceptions, as
                it is often the exception that proves the rule. Last year OFREG
                was looking for an additional £355,000 for publicity and
                consultancy. This year the original provision was £527,000, but
                now it is seeking an additional £890,000. It strikes me that
                that requires an explanation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also important to focus particular
                scrutiny on the figure for superannuation and other allowances.
                I have spoken on this area and asked questions about it before.

                Treasury. Last year there was an original provision of
                £5·5&nbsp;million, which was increased in the Supplementaries
                by £7·8 million giving a total of £13·3 million. This year
                the original provision was £3·7 million, and now, in front of
                us, it is seeking an increase of £97·9 million, giving a total
                of £101·6 million. The type of escalation in those figures
                requires an explanation, particularly in view of the recent
                publicity over certain golden handshake or golden goodbye
                settlements that have been reached in some sectors of the public
                service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The escalation in those figures requires an
                explanation, particularly given the amount of recent publicity
                over golden handshake or golden goodbye settlements that have
                been reached in some public-service sectors. Questions can
                justifiably be asked.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To create a situation in which we get things
                right and get our heads around the Supplementaries and the
                budgeting process, we need to look at the comments in the
                Comptroller and Auditor General’s report for 1999-2000 and
                read across from that report into the supplementaries. Changes
                in procedure and in Departments mean that that is not easy to
                do. However, some interesting facts emerge from an attempt.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A number of surpluses in the different
                Departments are obvious at the year-end of the auditor’s
                report. For example, the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure
                had a £5·2 million surplus. Last year it spent £153 million
                and had a surplus of £5·2 million, yet this year there is an
                estimate of £175·5&nbsp;million. Where is the read across
                between what is spent in a particular financial year and the
                estimate for provision for the subsequent year? There should be
                some connection, some reason, for deciding, on whatever basis,
                on a particular figure. The industrial support and regeneration
                account of the IDB had a surplus of £97·6&nbsp;million. The
                board spent £144 million last year. Social security is an
                interesting one. It had a surplus of £97·5 million when the
                various heads are added together.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will be interested to hear the Minister’s
                response. However, if year in, year out there can be surpluses,
                and if the figure spent in a particular financial year does not
                appear to have any real bearing on the figure provided for the
                subsequent year, the impression given is of a certain laxity in
                budgeting for any particular service. One can see under £7
                million in loss statements last year, of which
                £5·2&nbsp;million lay in the IDB’s Vote B. Analysing the
                reasons behind those losses poses questions on the proper
                financial controls applied throughout the Departments. If the
                respective Committees were able to perform their scrutiny roles
                properly, perhaps we would be in a better position to get to
                grips with the reasoning behind those losses. It would provide
                us all with a better opportunity for transparency in dealing
                with the issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In mentioning the Comptroller and Auditor
                General’s report, I must draw attention to the fact that he
                found it necessary to qualify six accounts, some of them not for
                the first time. The common fault line that appears to run
                through the reasons for those qualifications was the lack of
                proper financial control. That resulted in payments being made
                without invoices or sufficient evidence to support them,
                clerical errors and weaknesses in tendering and purchasing
                procedures et cetera. Those are matters that we as an Assembly
                have to try to ensure are got right sooner rather than later.
                This apparent sloppiness with regard to accounting in certain
                areas cannot continue. It has to be right, and it has to be seen
                to be right.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This year the Water Service is seeking more
                money. Last year it was forced into the situation of having to
                make an ex gratia payment of £450,000 because it had not got
                basic facts right. It had not completed land acquisition but had
                employed contractors to start work. It had not obtained planning
                permission, yet had employed contractors. The sum of £450,000
                may appear to be small fry in the overall Budget for Northern
                Ireland, but to the man, woman and child in the street it is
                not. To those waiting for hip replacements, or for a social care
                package, or whatever example one chooses, that is a large amount
                of money.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Through our constituency offices, we are all
                aware of individuals who feel they are being short-changed by
                Departments not giving them that to which they are entitled.
                Those individuals who are deprived in our society feel that it
                is important that this type of error or laxity cannot be seen to
                be happening again and again.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I mentioned social security. According to the
                last audit report, over-payments of £65 million were made. That
                has a dreadful impact on the socially deprived in our society.
                It makes them want to weep and question what is going on. We, as
                the custodians of the public purse, have got to be absolutely
                sure that what we are doing — and what the Departments are
                doing in our name — is seen to be above board, absolutely
                beyond reproach, transparent and accountable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not highlight these issues to give the
                impression of being overly critical. I recognise that, by and
                large, there is absolute transparency and accountability in the
                vast bulk of the issues confronting departments. We should take
                great pride in the operation of our civil servants. I do not
                think that can be stressed heavily enough. However, I raise
                those points so that the Minister, in reflecting and dealing
                with the issues that confront him, can recognise something he
                said in an earlier debate — that the money is in the system to
                do various things that we need to do now. We need to do those
                things now because, in many respects, the Assembly and the
                Executive are seen to be on trial. People want to see
                fundamental change, and they want to see it now. In many
                respects, they cannot wait for an uncertain number of years. The
                money is in the system, and I believe that the Minister, his
                officials and the Executive should be doing their utmost to
                ensure that wastage and inefficiency are cut out now, so that
                the schemes that are necessary to go ahead can do so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other Members and myself have referred to the
                increase in the regional rate. Some said that the money was
                there and that the figure could be reduced. I found it sad that
                it had to be an exercise akin to pulling teeth to get the
                necessary movement and the necessary reductions in the rate
                increase. I regret that, due to illness, I was unable to be here
                to thank the Minister for the small mercy on 12 February. The
                sudden pain in my stomach reminded me of the practice of
                sticking pins into little puppets, and I wondered if somebody
                was doing that to lay me low so quickly, just when we were about
                to deal with the rates.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Interestingly, on the same day, a Standing
                Order was moved with great haste through the House, which now
                means that accelerated passage will be the rule — rather than
                the exception — for the most important issue we deal with.
                That was a fundamental error. We should have been concentrating
                on getting procedures right rather than changing the rules to
                have accelerated passage as the norm. With every matter other
                than finance, Ministers will have to explain to the House why
                they are deciding on accelerated passage. Unfortunately, I
                missed that debate and did not get the opportunity to make my
                point. I just mention it now en passant, as it were.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to make a bit of a party political
                plea on a constituency basis, as other Members have. The money
                is in the system for the railway that Mr Poots mentioned,
                namely, the Knockmore line. The consultation period on that is
                coming to a close. The big issue that has to be considered by
                the Executive and by the Minister for Regional Development and
                his colleagues is that of hardship. Is there hardship, or will
                there be hardship, if that line closes? Clearly, the answer to
                that question is &quot;Yes&quot;. The people of Glenavy,
                Ballinderry, Lisburn and Crumlin will suffer hardship.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a totally backward step. It is
                reminiscent of the old Beeching plan, under which they were
                shutting every line that appeared. I do not accept this talk of
                mothballing. How many railway lines have been mothballed and
                then reopened? None. The money is available in the system to
                keep that line open, and that should be done. That message
                should come out from the consultation, and I hope — and I am
                not making a political point — that the Minister will go to
                the Executive, on this one issue, to argue the case with his
                Colleagues and ensure that that money is made available. It is
                in the system. He should ask for it, beg for it, and get it.
                That will be recognised by the people in the Lagan Valley
                constituency, and others, who will suffer hardship if that
                particular line is forced to close.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The question of out-of-town shopping
                developments has been raised. We in Lagan Valley are fortunate
                in many respects. We have a regional shopping centre, known as
                Sprucefield. However, things can be pushed a little too far. If
                development continues at Sprucefield at the rate that is
                currently proposed, it will be the death knell of a number of
                the shops and core businesses in the centre of our town. Is that
                progress? In my book, it is not. The character of our towns and
                villages needs to be retained, and therefore out-of-town
                shopping should be restricted. I ask the Minister to look at the
                type of proposals that Minister Dempsey in the South is
                currently considering, or may already have put in place, for
                restricting the size of such developments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reference has already been made to the rates.
                I will leave that to the rate revaluation that will be coming
                up. I hope that they get their sums right this time. Out-of-town
                shopping centres were not included in the last revaluation. I
                imagine that they have been riding rather easily until now, and
                I hope that that will be rectified. How are Thiepval Barracks,
                Maghaberry Prison and other Crown properties of that ilk dealt
                with in regard to rates, compared to the rate base in Lagan
                Valley or the borough of Lisburn? I understand that they may not
                be paying their full whack, yet I know for a fact that their
                bins have to be emptied. There is an issue here with regard to
                the rating system —</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Allow me to interrupt for a moment. There is
                no time limit on Members’ contributions. However, given the
                number of Members, especially from the smaller parties, who have
                indicated a desire to contribute, if each of them chooses to
                speak for 25 minutes there will be very serious difficulty in
                including them all.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Close:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appreciate that point. If and when we reach
                the stage of having full and proper scrutiny opportunities
                through the Committees, and other opportunities to really get to
                grips with this, long speeches will not be necessary. Anyway, 25
                minutes is not that long. I was unaware that so many people
                wanted to speak; a few names must have been added recently, so I
                shall conclude.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Are town plans likely to be superseded by the
                metropolitan plan? How much money will be wasted? The
                Knockmore-Sprucefield road link is needed to ease congestion in
                Lisburn. The building of the road has been put back again and
                again — sometimes, we are told that the work is on a 15-year
                plan, sometimes that it is on a 25-year plan. Could the Minister
                use his good offices, with the money that is available, to bring
                that plan to fruition sooner?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Estimates and the move to
                resource accounting. It will be easier for Committees and the
                Assembly to follow Budget lines.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As with other Estimates, I have studied the
                appropriations-in-aid. We should consider that carefully as we
                move towards private finance initiatives. Although I have gone
                through the Budget and the Estimates, I find it difficult to
                follow how much appropriation-in-aid comes to any Department
                through the sale of public land and buildings. That is an
                important issue. Constituency offices receive many telephone
                calls about what has happened to public land — whether it has
                been sold and, if so, how much money has gone to the public
                purse and how much to the developers. We need to ask such
                questions, so I welcome the move to a new way of budgeting.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am concerned that much of the new money is
                available because of poor planning. Some of the circumstances
                were unforeseen and were beyond any Minister’s control.
                However, there were failures. I am concerned by the fact that
                £10 million of slippage money has appeared in the Department of
                Education’s budget as a result of the failure to provide
                schools with the information technology that they needed. Was
                that because of a failed public-private partnership? If so, how
                that will be addressed in the future? I would welcome a response
                now or in writing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should pay attention to the Estimates
                because they involve a huge sum of money — £196 million. I
                echo other Members’ concerns that they have not had enough
                opportunity to scrutinise the figure. However, it is good that
                we have the opportunity, unlike Westminster, to debate spring
                Estimates. The more that we debate the issue in this Assembly,
                the more the public will see that we are trying to be open and
                transparent and that we can be held accountable for where the
                money goes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am concerned that the Estimates for the
                Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety show
                that £5 million went to deal with clinical negligence. That
                could not have been foreseen. However, I understand that that is
                not the total. One figure mentioned to the Committee was close
                to £20 million. We will have to pay more attention to that;
                huge sums of money are being reallocated to cover costs that
                arise from negligence.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also interesting to note, as regards
                the Department of Higher and Further Education, Training and
                Employment, that £2·5 million will not now be spent on the
                Springvale campus. Is it the case that this Department, like
                many other Departments in respect of capital investment, could
                not spend the money in time, or is it that the money was no
                longer required? The latter would be unusual. Given that it is
                such a substantial sum, the response will be interesting.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I echo Dr Birnie’s views on the moneys that
                have now been made available as a result of a reduction in
                unemployment or because of the inability to market some
                programmes well enough, particularly those concerning management
                development. As Dr Birnie said, Northern Ireland requires a
                great deal of training, if it requires anything. It is sad that
                the money could not be spent, given that a budget was set up for
                training. The funds will now have to go elsewhere, to be spent
                by others before the end of March.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Higher and Further
                Education, Training and Employment requires an extra £1·5
                million because of changes due to devolution. It would be
                interesting to know — as it would for other Departments also
                — what is meant by changes due to devolution. The Department
                of Culture, Arts and Leisure has had a substantial amount of
                money given to it because it is a new Department, and because of
                changes due to devolution. The Supplementary Estimates indicate
                that the £1·5 million is also in respect of the private
                finance initiatives (PFIs). We need to be able to answer
                questions from the public about what that money is spent on in
                relation to PFI.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally — this is a repeated plea of mine
                — we need to change the headings used for the Office of the
                First Minister and the Deputy First Minister. The largest sum of
                money is the £12 million under the heading &quot;Community
                Relations, Equality and Victims – Current&quot;. We need to
                see that figure broken down further. We need to know how much is
                going to the Equality Commission, towards human rights, to
                community relations or to the Victims Unit itself.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That organisation must have been doing a very
                good job because it required very little money in this Estimate.
                It speaks volumes about excellent planning. However, every time
                I speak about this matter I say that the entire budget for those
                areas should not be on one line. A breakdown should be given as
                it is in other Departments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Inasmuch as I welcome the Estimates, I remain
                concerned that much of the document refers to poor planning in
                Departments and substantial slippage as a result of some failed
                initiatives, particularly in PFIs.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I intend to review the debate situation at
                1.30 pm. We may continue after that time because of the large
                number of Members wishing to speak.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Leslie:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this debate, there is the risk of trotting
                the same horses around the paddock again. The same applies to
                tomorrow’s debate on the Budget. Technically, we are rounding
                off a Budget that we did not scrutinise. Next year, when we deal
                with the spring Estimates, we will be rounding off the Budget
                that will be laid before the House tomorrow. In that respect, we
                should remind ourselves that, at the behest of the Finance and
                Personnel Committee, we had a thorough debate on that Budget in
                November, with a view to making it possible to influence the
                setting of the final Budget.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is the case that by the time you get to
                the Estimates the Budget has been set and you are simply putting
                the agreement made a few months earlier into prescriptive form.
                Overall, the structure we have devised during the course of the
                past six months is probably quite good. Next year, when we have
                a full run at it, including an opportunity for Committees to do
                their work, between Easter and the first round of Budget setting
                in the autumn, I hope that we will do a great deal to influence
                the shape of the Budget.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish that I could echo Assembly Member
                McWilliams’s confidence that moving to resource accounting
                will make it easier to understand the accounts. I suspect that
                it will make it much more difficult. Maybe after a couple of
                years the clouds will lift, but I am certainly not looking
                forward to wrestling with the first edition. I am glad that
                there is some parallel running of the old system to give us a
                clue in the first year of the new system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What will be significant in those resource
                accounts will be the valuing of Government assets. I hope that
                the ability to readily see the extent of our assets may cause
                people to think creatively about those assets and whether we are
                making the best use of them and examine opportunities for
                looking at how we raise and spend our money in several different
                ways. That may in itself provide some of the answers as to how
                we manage to get a quart out of a pint pot. If we were to take
                all the demands for money made by Departments, Members and
                Committees seriously, we would be at least trying to fill a
                quart with a pint pot.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the much discussed subject of the Barnett
                formula, I and other members of the Finance and Personnel
                Committee were in London last week. We had the opportunity to
                — very informally, I am glad to say — kick this around with
                one or two Members at Westminster.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to be cautious in addressing this
                issue. There are very real risks of stirring up a hornets’
                nest. What one has to remember is that the Northern Ireland
                Assembly, the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for
                Wales, the English regions, the Mayor of London — every single
                one of them — have the same intention: they want more money in
                their pot.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore, all things being equal, it will
                have to come out of somebody else’s pot, and not one of those
                entities will agree to any money being taken out of their pot.
                We have to approach this with some caution. The only other thing
                that can happen is that the overall size of the pot has to be
                increased, and there is only one way that that can happen — by
                increased taxation. I have said in the House before, and I will
                continue to say, that I am exceedingly averse to increased
                taxation. The way to stimulate the economy is by lowering
                taxation, not by raising it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the context of the debate about rates, I
                am relieved that it has not proved necessary to make the
                increases that were originally outlined to the rates. If there
                is a realistic opportunity of getting a better outcome on
                Barnett or some revised formula, we may have to do that. We
                should be aware that that would almost certainly be in the
                context of higher rates. However, we have to ask ourselves, if
                we are not likely to get the better outcome, whether it might be
                better to get by on less and not have what one might call the
                negative stimulus of ever-increasing rates. Those matters
                require serious consideration.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also remind the House that when you
                increase tax, whether it is rates or anything else, you are
                making an assumption that the Government can spend the money for
                the better public good than people could if it were left in
                their pockets. That is an exceedingly doubtful contention, and
                there is only a tenuous link between cost and benefit. That
                became apparent on the mainland last year when we saw protests
                over the level of tax on fuel. Some 75% of the cost of fuel for
                motor cars is taxation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some Members regularly draw attention to
                issues in relation to targeting social needs and targeting
                particular areas of deprivation. I am aware of the problem.
                There are a quite a number of such places in my constituency.
                Unfortunately, Moyle District Council in North Antrim shares the
                highest unemployment rate in Northern Ireland with Strabane. I
                am conscious of the need to find some means to address that.
                However, it should be in the context of getting Northern Ireland’s
                unemployment rate down from its current level of about 5·5% —
                which is a big improvement in itself — to 3%. That figure is
                regarded as being fairly close to full employment in relation to
                those whom it is possible to employ. That is how we will be able
                to address most of these problems.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addressing the issue, we must focus on our
                skills base and the provision of training in new skills. It is
                clear from the problems in agriculture and textiles that there
                are a number of skills for which there is less of a market —
                we cannot produce a product in Northern Ireland at a competitive
                price using those skills. We must therefore be proactive in
                finding ways to re-equip workers who have been adversely
                affected by those circumstances with other skills that can be
                applied to businesses that are in a growth phase. All Members
                will have noticed the situation that has arisen in Wales. A
                considerable number of steelworkers are being made redundant,
                and it looks as though there may be an opportunity to redeploy a
                significant number of them in part of the telecommunications
                industry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must be alert. We must be realistic about
                what is happening to our economy and to some of our traditional
                industries, and we must put measures in place to address those
                problems. It is not particularly helpful to the affected
                workers, or to anyone else, to start howling with anguish after
                the problem has manifested itself, when it is obvious that the
                problem is there right now. In that respect, I am particularly
                anxious about, and will continue to closely view, the allocation
                of moneys to the Department of Higher and Further Education,
                Training and Employment and to the Department of Enterprise,
                Trade and Investment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rather than pre-empt tomorrow’s debate, or
                leave myself with nothing to say in it, I will conclude my
                remarks.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Audit Committee (Mr
                Dallat):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am pleased with the approach being taken by
                the DUP and the Alliance Party on out-of-town shopping centres.
                Mr Poots and Mr Close are to be congratulated for the concern
                that they expressed this morning about the uncontrolled
                development of such centres. They are, of course, representing
                the views of the 20,000 people employed in the independent
                retail sector. My only regret is that they failed to support the
                motion that I brought before the Assembly a few months ago on
                that very issue. Nevertheless, the views voiced today are
                important. It is to be hoped that a new motion, which will be
                guaranteed support from both the DUP and the Alliance Party, can
                soon be put before the Assembly. That would be a great source of
                comfort to the many small shops in towns and villages throughout
                Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I now turn to the more important issues of
                services and how we spend our money. Tomorrow, there will be
                widespread support for increased powers for the public auditor.
                The Assembly can then have a handle on the millions of pounds
                expended by the bodies that draw on the public purse. The amount
                stated today, which the Comptroller and Auditor General
                requires, is £2,327,000. Will the Minister confirm that that
                amount includes the additional costs of carrying out the extra
                duties to which I referred and which I hope will be passed when
                the Assembly debates the Government Resources and Accounts Bill?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I impress upon the Minister the need for
                there to be no unnecessary delays on reports prepared by public
                auditor. I recognise that, as recently as last week’s Question
                Time, the Minister provided an undertaking that there would be
                no such hold-ups.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By way of example, I refer to a report on the
                Water Service that was published recently. The report took
                almost two years to agree. That is totally unacceptable and does
                not represent good value for money. Perhaps today would be a
                good time to send out a clear message to all Departments that
                when we allocate money to the Comptroller and Auditor General to
                ensure public money is well spent his reports should not be
                delayed. They must be made available at the earliest opportunity
                so that the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) can scrutinise them
                with a view to improving value for money. The Minister gave us
                an assurance that that would happen, and I simply emphasise that
                again.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, when reports come before the PAC
                there must be more than just a little smack on the knuckles.
                Where serious bad practices are uncovered, they must be
                addressed, because it is only then that the public will
                recognise that the Assembly is making a real impact on how
                public money is being spent.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I refer to a serious report last week on
                serious deficiencies in the tendering procedures of the Northern
                Ireland Tourist Board (NITB), which led to printing contracts
                being awarded involving millions of pounds. Not only did the
                contracts go to a company whose chief executive is also chief
                executive of the NITB, they did not go to the person making the
                lowest tender. Those disclosures have undermined confidence in
                the NITB’s procurement procedures and call for action beyond a
                ticking off from the PAC.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No one is claiming impropriety, but there is
                little dispute that the chief executive,
                Mr&nbsp;Roy&nbsp;Bailie, should not be holding a key position in
                NITB while at the same time, in another capacity, providing
                millions of pounds of goods and services to NITB.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The money we allocate today to the Northern
                Ireland Audit Office must bring about real change if we are to
                conduct the financial affairs of our publicly funded bodies, and
                that includes NITB. To date, there is not enough evidence that
                things are about to change dramatically. That worries me and
                will no doubt worry the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The PAC, under the chairmanship of Mr Billy
                Bell, has done a good job. However, the enormous energy applied
                by that Committee must not be ignored or undermined by
                reluctance, or by the bad practices which crept into Departments
                over 30 years of direct rule when there was limited opportunity
                to scrutinise or criticise Government expenditure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The money allocated to the Northern Ireland
                Audit Office today will assist the better use of public money,
                but it also requires a determination to stamp out bad practices
                when they occur. If we deal with that issue, many of the
                concerns expressed today can be addressed with a view to
                providing better value for money. The Assembly can make a real
                impact by taking the reins and insisting that the standard of
                services provided are improved, and it can really make the
                changes necessary to get better value for money.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hay:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The lack of accountability has been
                highlighted in what has been announced this morning. The
                Committees have not had the opportunity to properly scrutinise
                what has been announced this morning. It is right that we, as
                public representatives, lay down a marker on that serious issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister’s announcement last Monday
                concerned a reduction in the proposed 8% increase in the
                regional rate. The Minister fully explained how it was possible
                to reduce the regional rate. However, there was a head of steam
                building up in the public domain, especially in the small
                business community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reality struck when most councils worked out
                their rates estimates for the year. During our city council’s
                discussions on rates estimates and council expenditure, the
                Finance Minister’s announcement of 8% on the regional rate was
                uppermost in councillors’ minds. The council expressed concern
                about that announcement. The pressure from the small business
                community in Northern Ireland and local government agencies led
                to the Minister’s announcement last Monday. The announcement
                was welcomed by everyone — especially by those in local
                government and small business who are facing difficult decisions
                and challenges.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister’s announcement on gap funding
                was also welcomed. This has been a problem for some time in
                Northern Ireland, especially since it became clear that Peace II
                was not going to hit the ground as quickly as was intended.
                There was panic when most people realised that. Most of those
                involved in projects, especially those in the voluntary sector,
                realised that by the end of March there would be serious
                difficulties for the work that they had been doing under
                difficult circumstances and for many of the projects that were
                funded under Peace I.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Minister tell the House how much
                money is left for the various organisations under Peace I? I am
                open to correction, but I understand that that money must be
                spent by the end of June. The public is concerned that if the
                Peace I money is not spent — and we are talking about several
                millions of pounds — it will be taken from Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members and the Minister have been lobbied by
                various groups and organisations about the Peace I money. That
                money could provide funding for the voluntary and community
                sectors until Peace II hits the ground. It is difficult for
                organisations to understand why money cannot be made available
                when there is still a huge amount to be drawn down and spent
                under Peace I.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Minister indicate how much money is
                still available, by what date it has to be spent and whether
                Northern Ireland will lose that money if it is not spent?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are a number of district partnerships
                in the Province. Some have spent 60% of their allocation, and
                others have spent 70%, but there are partnerships that have
                spent as little as 50%. That is a worrying trend of which the
                Minister must be aware.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the context of regional development, I
                welcome the additional resources announced for roads
                maintenance.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Sir John Gorman] in the
                Chair)</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the allocation falls short of what
                is needed. It does not go far enough. The Minister has inherited
                a 30-year underspend in Roads Service generally. The same
                applies to all other Departments. However, the problem of
                resources for road maintenance continually comes up in the
                Regional Development Committee, and it is causing deep concern.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The other worrying problem is the reduction
                in capital expenditure for Roads&nbsp;Service because of delays
                in the commencement of schemes. When those schemes eventually
                get the go-ahead, will money then be made available? We do not
                know which schemes have been delayed and why they have been
                delayed. There are capital schemes across the Province which
                need to be looked at seriously and which need expenditure. The
                Minister must address that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Regional Development Committee has
                discussed the Knockmore railway line. It is wrong for the hon
                Member Seamus&nbsp;Close to say that railway lines that have
                been mothballed stay mothballed. That is not the case. During
                direct rule, Ministers had a policy of closing railways across
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland. If they could get away with it, there is
                no doubt that they would still be doing it today. When the
                Regional Development Committee examined the matter, it was
                obvious that that was its clear policy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister for Regional Development and the
                Committee are conscious of the need for a good public service
                rail facility across Northern&nbsp;Ireland. Railways are
                uppermost in our minds. People need a reason for moving from the
                private car to public transport. The Minister and the Committee
                are committed to looking seriously at the whole railway network.
                Other Committee members have raised concerns about how the
                Knockmore railway line issue has been handled. The Committee is
                awaiting a number of reports, and we will be deliberating in the
                future. It is wrong to say that when lines close they are
                mothballed. Under direct rule that would have been the case, but
                under the Assembly and the Minister for Regional Development
                that will not be the case.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Generally we very much welcome the Minister’s
                announcement of extra expenditure. He will never please
                everybody, but if he pleases everybody sometimes it may be
                enough to get him elected.</p>

                It is ironic that I get up at the moment that the time is
                reduced to about 50% of what I need. I always like to touch on
                the different Departments, as it is often the only opportunity
                that we get while we have Committee struggles with which to
                deal.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Take the Department of Health, for instance.
                The trusts have got an extra £18 million, and they have to
                decide what they want to do with that. They have been struggling
                with their debts and have also been told by the boards that they
                have to keep within their limits. Take the western area, where
                there has been a continual loss of services in places such as
                Enniskillen and Omagh. Services are continually being drained
                away from us. Quite often you wonder whether the pressure is on
                all the time for people to actually pay for themselves, rather
                than letting the NHS do what it is supposed to do. There seems
                to be a drive towards that all the time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are talking about resources and the price
                of resources. Private operations are taking place in NHS
                theatres. These are all questions people will ask. At the end of
                the day, who is paying for what? It all comes out of the same
                budget. NHS patients have to wait and suffer. Some trusts, such
                as one in my area, are in the business of leasing land, while at
                the same time trying to acquire land in case we ever have to
                build a new hospital, which I think will be necessary in that
                part of the Six Counties. At a later date, the budget from here
                might have to be used in a much greater proportion than the
                amount that they are going to gain from the leasing to buy back
                land that might be needed. I want to flag that up because it is
                a very important issue regarding the budget for the Department
                and for the trust.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I always welcome any extra spending on
                education. However, central administration funding has been
                mentioned again, and boards have got considerably more. It is
                administration versus what goes into the school or learning. It
                looks as though we have 5% going to children or learning and 95%
                going to administration and pay. There is a certain difficulty
                in people’s minds about where administration is going and why
                there has to be so much emphasis on it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots described Irish-medium education as
                wasted funds. Irish-medium education is a growing area and Irish
                is an important language. Germany and other countries consider
                their local language to be number one, and they will not allow
                any movement on that. That is what we should be doing. Social
                inclusion is part of the Good Friday Agreement and part of the
                successful future that we need through all the negotiated points
                of the agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also welcome money going to the libraries.
                That is important. I often wonder whether there is as much going
                to libraries in rural areas as there is to libraries in urban
                areas. People in rural areas often have to rely on mobile
                libraries.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am a member of the Agriculture Committee.
                Without going over everything that we talked about, I want to
                say that there is nothing extra for farmers now, just as there
                was nothing in the last funding round. It points out the
                commitment of Government to the future. There has to be a change
                in future Budgets. The Department has asked for more money for
                administration costs; that is where the difficulty lies. The
                Department is bound up in administration, and farmers find that
                taxing and expensive. It has to move away from red tape, as do
                all the others.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As was mentioned, there is a social services
                surplus — there has been year after year, even going back to
                the days of direct rule. However, in many instances people are
                failing to receive the money to which they are entitled, because
                they are in weak and vulnerable situations, and bureaucratic
                pressures target them in a drive to save money in relation to
                fraud. The Department of Health, Social Services and Public
                Safety will have to look at that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fermanagh lost another 90 jobs last week at
                the Aldervale textile factory, and there were further losses in
                Newry. I have asked the Department of Enterprise, Trade and
                Investment, as well as other bodies, to look at the facts behind
                the job losses and to understand that that is not something that
                we are making up, it is a fact. I want to see action to help put
                that right, and there must be equality of spending in the
                region, and the wrongs in relation to job losses must be put
                right. There must be parity in respect of the money that is
                drawn down for us at a local level and on an east/west basis.
                The situation with regard to the Industrial Development Board (IDB)
                and the Local Enterprise Development Unit (LEDU) — which is
                not delivering for us in those areas — needs to be looked at.
                Obviously they are going through a phase of change, and we hope
                that that will help to deliver something different and more
                positive to us in the future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As regards the Department for Regional
                Development, the roads maintenance budget in the Fermanagh and
                South Tyrone area is vastly underfunded. The area has a small
                percentage of class A roads that require gritting all the time,
                so we get much less from that budget than Belfast, for example.
                There has been talk about equality in road budgets, but there is
                an increasing failure and weakness in the road structure at all
                levels from here to Fermanagh. The number of pot holes is
                increasing, and many people are asking about compensation for
                damage to their vehicles. People are taxed for road maintenance,
                and they are also taxed when they have to fix their vehicles
                when they are damaged. That is happening more often, and more
                money must be allocated to rural areas in the roads budget. The
                Department needs to look again at how things are done in order
                to try to save money.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rail transport is important. My constituency
                does not have rail links, but if it did we would be more
                positive about the budget for that.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Culture, Arts and
                Leisure Committee (Mr ONeill):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On behalf of my Committee, I welcome those
                alterations that have produced additional funding for the
                Department — especially increased provisions in research and
                consultation exercises and in capital spending for libraries.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, I stress our gratitude to the
                Department, as well as the Minister of Finance and Personnel,
                for providing a considerable increase in funding to address
                urgent health and safety issues at sports grounds. As you know,
                Mr Deputy Speaker, that is of major concern to many people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Likewise, we should record our gratitude for
                the increased community involvement finance for millennium
                celebrations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In line with the Committee’s report — the
                long-awaited inland fisheries report, which I hope to see
                finally published before the beginning of March — money has
                been made available for a scientific study of that matter. That
                is necessary to enable us to ascertain the impact of
                hydroelectric schemes on river fisheries. It is a major step
                forward in recognising our aspiration for clean energy sources,
                while ensuring that those do not disturb the quality of river
                life or any related environmental aspects.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the Vote on Account, some
                £71·4&nbsp;million has been indicated for the forthcoming
                year. We welcome the increases for areas such as libraries,
                health and safety in sports grounds, the languages body and the
                attempts to provide access to and participation in the arts by
                young people, especially those from the more disadvantaged
                sections of the community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the Department’s total bid,
                I must emphasise that, although it is a small Department, it
                considers the bid to be modest in comparison with it’s
                assessment of need. We therefore argue for as much sympathy as
                possible from the Department of Finance and Personnel. It got
                little more than 25% of what it asked for, and for a small
                Department that is something that merits attention.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a great need for funding to buy out
                the commercial fish nets from around the Northern Ireland
                coastline. Unfortunately, we were unable sufficiently to impress
                that need to secure the necessary funds. There are many things
                that could impact on the dreadful condition of our wild salmon
                stocks and other fish species, such as sea trout. The most
                important thing that we could do to change that downward trend
                in the population graphs is remove coastal netting licences. Our
                inquiry — and we are awaiting the publication of the report on
                that — has underlined the importance of fishing as part of a
                recreational tourist industry. That is important to the economy
                of Northern Ireland and to the anglers. We are coming from a low
                base, although the potential for economic development is great
                and meaningful, as indeed is the revenue return to the
                Department of Finance and Personnel.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On behalf of the Committee, I emphasise that
                we are concerned that the spending plans do not include any
                funding for safety improvements to existing motorcycle road
                racing facilities. This matter has taken up a lot of time in the
                Committee and has become one of great public concern over the
                past 12&nbsp;months or more, which saw many tragic deaths that
                spurred the Minister and the Department of Culture, Arts and
                Leisure to set up a special team to look into it. The Department
                has made a number of recommendations, which cannot be
                implemented without a considerable degree of financial support.
                This issue requires urgent attention, and I hope that by my
                re-emphasising its importance, it will not get lost. The
                Committee generally respects the difficulties that the
                Department of Finance and Personnel faces. However, the bids
                that we have made have not succeeded to the extent that we would
                like.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I listened to the debate with interest. There
                was much comment on the control, monitoring and scrutiny of
                budgetary activity. Quite justifiably, great emphasis was placed
                on the elimination of waste and poor accounting procedures.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was particularly interested in the Public
                Accounts Committee and its recent work concerning the Department
                of Agriculture and Rural Development. Its report drew particular
                attention to the Department’s accounting procedures, and it
                was quite right to do that. However, many Committee members, in
                their subsequent comments, put an unfortunate spin on the
                activities of some of the community groups involved. On behalf
                of those hardworking voluntary groups, I must say that a poor
                impression was left.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have not been the first today to introduce
                Dickensian references. In criticising a particular scheme in
                Ardglass, the comments of Seamus &quot;Uriah Heep&quot; Close
                about delivering money around each individual member made for a
                damaging statement. We are all anxious to ensure the best in
                public accountability, that everything is open to scrutiny, and
                that better value for money is achieved. I hope, however, that
                when something deserves attention we will be more careful about
                how our findings are presented.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCarthy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most of the important points have been
                covered. My deputy leader, Mr Seamus Close, spoke eloquently for
                almost half an hour. However, I have a couple of points to make.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McHugh, Mr Hay and Mr Poots spoke about
                the underfunding of the roads system. Although I welcome the
                Minister’s speech, in which he said that funding has been
                provided for a new vessel to operate between Portaferry and
                Strangford, some of my constituents are still disappointed at
                the Assembly’s reluctance to even consider the possibility of
                a bridge across Strangford Lough.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am particularly concerned about the
                apparent inequality in the Department for Regional Development’s
                distribution of funds to different areas of Northern Ireland. My
                constituency of Strangford would appeal to the Minister for
                Regional Development to allocate more funding for road
                maintenance in rural areas. Modern, large vehicles, tractors and
                milk tankers have destroyed rural roads, and will continue to do
                so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not know whether the Minister for
                Regional Development knows that some milk distributors are
                considering introducing even broader tankers. Someone mentioned
                the gritting of roads. If broader tankers are introduced, there
                will be no need for gritting, because rural roads will be so
                badly cut up. Such vehicles destroy rural roads.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Roads Service division in my constituency
                does not seem to have the funding to repair roads or for simple
                minor road-widening schemes. Thus, we have an outcry from
                constituents whose cars are wrecked when they use those roads.
                As has been said, compensation is hard to come by. I ask Mr
                Durkan to ensure that Mr Campbell distributes funding on a fair
                and equitable basis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, I would like to mention health
                issues. Again, I welcome the new investment, which is going into
                the provision of a decent Health Service, but much more needs to
                be done. We need more funding for cancer research, for example.
                We need more ambulances. Many other facilities in the Health
                Service need much more funding.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I conclude by putting down a marker. I must
                impress on the Minister that we look forward to the
                implementation of the report of the Royal Commission so that in
                due course we will provide free residential and nursing care for
                our elderly. That is a major problem which needs to be acted
                upon, and I hope that it will come before the Assembly soon.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I finish by welcoming the Minister’s
                statement. I hope that he will take what I have said into
                consideration.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate you on finishing in less than
                half your time. It is a good example.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Kane:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although I readily accept the complexity and
                scale of the task of compiling budgetary proposals, I assume
                that areas in the scope of the Budget have been less than
                provided for and that that will serve as a lesson for the
                Minister and his Department of Finance and Personnel in the
                future. These areas where lessons may be learnt are no doubt
                numerous and should be given consideration. No one will draw
                comfort from bogus percentage increases, which, when considered
                carefully, produce only minimal changes in funding levels.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I fail to see how the vision steering group
                will be able to provide the long-term and medium-term strategies
                that it is hoped will put the agriculture industry back on any
                kind of firm footing. That message is interpreted in the
                industry to mean that low priority is being given to the
                industry and its problems. Frankly, I fail to see how the
                allocation of £10 million will be enough to enable us to
                implement the recommendations of the vision group that we must
                implement if we are to tackle problems of this magnitude.
                Furthermore, the figure fails to account for the percentage of
                the sum that will be swallowed by administration.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I risk being repetitive when I mention how
                vital farm capital investment grants are. Let me just qualify
                the term &quot;farm capital investment&quot; by saying that this
                is not an attempt to provide every farm in the Province with
                state-of-the-art farmyards and livestock accommodation. It is a
                call for assistance to reverse the decline that has occurred on
                farms during the past five years. For example, on a local farm,
                when an official from the Department of Agriculture and Rural
                Development arrived to inspect animals for the first stage beef
                special premium scheme, he was accompanied by a health and
                safety inspector. Why? If the facilities were substandard on
                that farm, how do you blame the farmer, and who is listening to
                the calls for assistance anyway?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, despite announcements about research
                on the eradication of tuberculosis and brucellosis in cattle,
                the inadequacy of funding has been demonstrated over the past
                week. I say this with reference to Greenmount Agricultural
                College, where over 200 breeding animals have been slaughtered
                because of an outbreak of brucellosis. Farming could do without
                that level of uncertainty about those diseases. It says
                something about the Department of Finance and Personnel’s
                allocation for research when the diseases continue to be
                unchecked. It also says something about the Department of
                Agriculture and Rural Development’s housekeeping when an
                outbreak occurs in one of our agricultural colleges.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I conclude by thanking the Minister for his
                presentation.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thank you, Mr Kane. That was creditably
                brief.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Savage:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s comments. However,
                the Agriculture and Rural Development Committee did not get the
                opportunity to discuss the papers in question, so I cannot
                respond on its behalf. The Supplementary Estimates are a
                housekeeping exercise that are designed to obtain formal
                approval of decisions on the reallocation of funds following the
                various monitoring rounds. From that perspective, the additional
                funds announced for agriculture, following the monitoring
                reviews, will be contained in the supplementary figures sought.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Deputy Chairman of the Agriculture
                Committee, I must comment on the notice given with the papers.
                Members of other Committees will agree that there has been no
                time for informed debate at Committee level. Our Committee was
                given little opportunity to participate in the Budget process,
                including the monitoring rounds, so we will be pushing for
                greater involvement in the 2001-02 financial year. We will also
                be seeking, at an appropriate stage, information on expenditure
                from the Department for Regional Development’s budget. The
                true value will then be seen of the additional allocations which
                we are being asked to support today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We hear of the huge amount of money to be
                channelled into agriculture, but the entire farming industry in
                Northern Ireland needs to be given an injection. The industry
                requires environmental schemes as well as restructuring to
                streamline services. I also ask the Minister to consider
                seriously the proposal for a long-term, low-interest loan
                scheme, which would give the entire industry a whole new lease
                of life. Such a scheme could stand alone as it would structure
                itself.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another emerging issue, which has been
                touched upon by many Members, is the state of the Province’s
                roads. My own constituency of Upper Bann is one of the fastest
                growing areas outside Belfast. The increase in traffic and
                industry in that area is placing a good deal more pressure on
                our roads. An in-depth review of our infrastructure is needed,
                and I hope that our roads will benefit from such a review. The
                Roads Service’s regional offices inform us that they are
                prepared to carry out developments, but that they are prohibited
                by a lack of finance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The lack of Water Service schemes is also a
                major problem. Since Christmas and &quot;the big frost&quot;, a
                mile-long stretch of road in my area has become covered in
                patches where pipes have burst, which can be seen approximately
                every three metres. An unbelievable amount of money has been
                spent on the maintenance of local water supplies. I presume that
                money has been made available for that purpose, because every
                other day there is a burst pipe in the area.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many Members have highlighted work that needs
                to be done in different areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the news that money is going to be
                spent on a rail service. Over the past two days the rail service
                has been in the headlines because people have misused it in an
                attempt to make it difficult for others to use. I hope that a
                measure can be introduced so that those people who are making
                life miserable for our commuters can be taken to task for it.
                The system is being abused, and it could do without that abuse.
                I hope that all those issues will be taken on board.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many matters have been discussed this
                morning, and I am not going to repeat them because I have seen
                Mr Durkan writing all morning. I do not want to add to his
                summing-up list, as long as he keeps Upper Bann to the
                forefront. Many things in my constituency need attention.
                However, there are level-headed people in various sectors in
                Upper Bann, and all they need is an injection of money. It does
                not take much to make a big difference. If that can be taken on
                board, the results that will flow will be unbelievable.</p>

                Committee (Mr A Maginness):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Savage implored the Minister to be mindful
                of Upper Bann. I would like him to keep North Belfast in his
                thoughts also.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s speech today. It
                was delivered with characteristic skill and effectiveness. We
                are used to his skilful presentation and analysis — it is of
                great benefit to all who are trying to follow the detail of the
                figures presented today. Several of the announcements about
                additional expenditure are particularly welcome to the Regional
                Development Committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Resources are scarce and money is clearly in
                short supply. Nevertheless, resources have been used
                imaginatively, and the Minister and Departments have effectively
                maximised the use of those resources for the people of Northern
                Ireland. That is not to say that all is perfect and rosy in the
                garden — far from it. However, we welcome the additional
                funding to allow for free travel for the elderly from October
                2001. We also welcome the £5·3 million for the road
                infrastructure, in particular for structural maintenance. The
                allocation of an additional £3·1 million for a modern
                integrated ticketing system for bus and rail is important if we
                are to have an effective co-ordination of rail and bus services
                and for the development of a realistic and effective public
                transportation policy. I greet the additional grant of £19·6
                million for the rail infrastructure as a timely intervention by
                the Executive and the Minister of Finance and Personnel to
                support our under-resourced railway system. It will add
                significantly to the development of a public transportation
                strategy for Northern Ireland. The extra £14·5&nbsp;million
                for water and sewerage capital investment is heartening, as that
                area that has been starved of funding for many years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although that will not cure what is an
                immensely difficult problem, it is a welcome start. The
                £41·9&nbsp;million from the Chancellor’s initiative for
                capital road projects is necessary to relieve the road
                infrastructure problems in Northern Ireland. I welcome the
                additional £7&nbsp;million from the Executive programme funds’
                infrastructure/ capital renewal fund to deal with these
                problems. That represents an overall increase of about 10% on
                expenditure over previous years, which the Regional Development
                Committee welcomes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I wish to highlight remaining areas
                of underfunding. Most notably, if bus and rail services are to
                provide an effective, reliable and affordable public
                transportation system, major investment is required. The first
                stage of public consultation over the regional transportation
                strategy is due to be completed shortly. It is likely that a
                central theme — and I hope it will be a central theme — will
                be a public transportation system that supports a socially
                inclusive and vibrant economy. That cannot be realised without
                the required financial investment. Therefore, I ask the Minister
                of Finance and Personnel to give it his immediate attention. The
                draft Programme for Government recognises the importance of an
                effective road infrastructure to support a modern and vibrant
                economy. Consequently, it is important that funding is targeted
                at existing bottlenecks along key transport corridors such as
                Toome, which the Minister for Regional Development knows is a
                top priority, as does the Minister of Finance and Personnel.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The draft programme of work also states that
                we will undertake a programme of road maintenance, based on good
                practice treatments. What additional funding will be made
                available for that programme of work? Water and sewerage have
                consistently been underfunded, and it is estimated that an
                additional £3&nbsp;billion will be required over the next
                10&nbsp;years. The extreme weather conditions that we suffered
                recently have shown that the water and sewerage infrastructures
                are not capable of coping with the problems that have arisen.
                They require immediate attention and major investment, and I
                urge the Minister to look at those favourably.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the additional funding available in
                the Executive programme funds’ infrastructure/capital renewal
                fund — a total of £7&nbsp;million this year,
                £40&nbsp;million next year and £100&nbsp;million the following
                year. How will that funding support the Department for Regional
                Development’s priorities, which are largely infrastructural?
                Secondly, how will it support the findings of both the regional
                development strategy and the regional transportation strategy?
                Finally, how will the Department for Regional Development and
                other Departments have access to the fund? The Minister must
                give clear advice on the criteria that will be used for that.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Kennedy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the opportunity to participate in
                this important debate. It is clear that many Members are
                interested in having a say on where money ought to be spent and
                how it should be made available. We welcome the opportunity this
                presents to us, in that spending priorities can now be made by a
                locally elected Assembly. There are a range of issues that
                Members have already mentioned, such as education, health and
                transport. Of particular concern to me, however, is that
                Mr&nbsp;Durkan should make money available to his ministerial
                colleagues — Sir&nbsp;Reg&nbsp;Empey in the Department of
                Enterprise, Trade and Investment, and Dr Farren for his
                responsibilities in training and employment, given the sad news
                of the job losses at the Adria textile plant in Newry last
                Friday. A total of 165 jobs will be lost. Announcements of that
                nature are to be regretted, and it is important that the
                Ministers with responsibility for enterprise, trade and training
                should be given an opportunity to prove to the workforce — and
                to the people of Newry and the surrounding region — that the
                Assembly is interested, is concerned and will rightly allocate
                moneys towards redeployment and training and trying to attract
                inward investment to the Newry area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although the announcement was not completely
                unexpected, the manner in which it came was a shock —
                especially to the employees. I have some criticisms to make of
                Adria in that respect. It is regrettable that they kept their
                employees in the dark before the announcement was made, and they
                have a duty, therefore, to put proper procedures in place to
                allow for the retraining and alternative opportunities that we
                spoke of earlier.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I join my Colleague Mr George Savage in
                condemnation of the continuing rail disruption in my
                constituency of Newry and Armagh. The railway line is
                continually dogged by hoax bombs or by real bombs. Those present
                a real danger to local people, as well as a great deal of
                inconvenience to rail and road users, local inhabitants and the
                industrial sector. It is important to continue to highlight that
                behaviour of that kind is completely unacceptable. It is an
                indication that security levels should remain high in the south
                Armagh area, and therefore the Government ought not to be taking
                any pre-emptive strikes to remove any of the security
                installations. I wish to place that on the record, although I do
                so in the context of welcoming the indication from the Minister
                that there will be increased moneys made available to upgrade
                the rail network.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The people of Northern Ireland will want to
                see the Assembly work in practical ways. They will want us to
                prove that the substantial investment in public funds, which
                went into creating and sustaining the Assembly, was worthwhile
                and can be seen to have tangible results. Changes in the road
                infrastructure, health and education and all other aspects
                should be made as quickly as possible. I commend the Minister,
                wish him well and hope that he will remember the constituency of
                Newry and Armagh in any considerations of the allocation of
                finance.</p>

                Some of you have been saying nice things about the Finance

                am, and I am sure he would like some lunch. I would not be

                have a short suspension. The sacrosanct 2.30 pm start for

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the opportunity to add to this
                debate and to call for financial support to facilitate the
                provision of slip roads from Antrim Hospital onto the M2. For
                too long, the people of South Antrim have been forced to endure
                long and unnecessary detours from the hospital, across the town,
                before joining the motorway that runs adjacent to the hospital.
                I understand that the Department for Regional Development would
                look favourably on the construction of slip roads. That would
                significantly shorten journeys and provide easy access for
                ambulance journeys to specialist services in Belfast hospitals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Not only would that provide a more rapid
                response for the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service attending
                emergency situations, but it could well mean that a life could
                be saved. I call on the Assembly to give serious consideration
                to road provisions that would have the support of not only the
                local community and patients using Antrim Hospital, but the
                United Hospital Trust. The availability of funding would allow
                proposals to move ahead immediately. It would not only improve
                the quality of health services, but allow for optimum
                performance at all times.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also appeal to the Assembly to make money
                available for more orthopaedic beds in the Royal Victoria
                Hospital. Currently, elderly people with broken limbs have to
                wait in Antrim Hospital for up to six days before admittance for
                surgery in Belfast. Also, patients attending the fracture clinic
                in Antrim Hospital were sent home on Wednesday 7 February
                because there was no doctor available to supervise the removal
                of the plaster casts. For people in their 70s and 80s, that is
                far from acceptable.</p>

                Far be it from me to keep the Minister from his lunch. I welcome
                the Minister’s statement. It has been a valuable exercise.
                That we now have locally elected Ministers making the decisions
                about where money is spent has been of benefit to everybody.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of my major concerns is the gap funding
                in the voluntary and community sectors. Although I welcome the
                £2·2 million that has been made available, there is still a
                serious shortfall in those sectors. Many groups have been doing
                invaluable work in the community and voluntary sectors, and
                those jobs are now on the critical list. Training, skills and
                experience could be wasted. Thousands of jobs are in danger, and
                people who have, for many years, carried out work that, by its
                nature, is difficult to quantify are in danger of losing their
                jobs. I want to see funding put on a secure footing. People do
                not know how long they will have jobs. The uncertainty in the
                sector is damaging.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some people have to spend a great deal of
                time administering a system that is complicated, and working to
                as many as eight or 10 different sets of criteria for different
                funders. We must simplify it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like the Minister to clarify a few
                points that arise from his comments last Monday. In relation to
                gap funding and room to manoeuvre, he mentioned projects that
                were not based on criteria that were as close as possible to
                those adopted in the new programmes, and where they do not
                succeed under the new peace programme. Are the criteria based on
                the old figures or the new figures? He mentioned a safety net
                that would be available if Departments needed additional
                spending power. Can he comment on that and on the cases in which
                an exit strategy for funding will be necessary? Some projects
                are not likely to come under the Peace II programme. I ask him
                to go into more detail on that. There has been a good deal of
                confusion over whether gap funding is based on the old criteria
                or the new and on how it is going to work. When will the new
                criteria be in place to allow the sector to evaluate and make
                bids?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Among the issues that concern the Social
                Development Committee is that of urban regeneration. Over the
                last few years, Belfast has benefited from most of the money
                spent in that context. I do not often find myself in agreement
                with the DUP, but Mr Poots was right when he said that a lot of
                that money is spent in Belfast and, to a lesser extent, in
                Derry. Meanwhile, towns and villages across the North are not
                benefiting from these resources.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Towns are struggling to encourage people to
                spend their money locally rather than drive to out-of-town
                shopping centres. I must declare an interest in town centre
                regeneration schemes because I am involved with one in Dungannon.
                If we fund these schemes, we may create a level playing field.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Housing does not feature in the Supplementary
                Estimates either, and that concerns me. There are still huge
                waiting lists, and 17% of social housing in Fermanagh is deemed
                unfit. Increases in homelessness are also continuing, and we are
                trying to introduce an updated system to eradicate fuel poverty.
                However, the pilot schemes have proved that, in this initiative,
                the rural community will be at a disadvantage. If we bring in
                half-measures, we cannot expect to end fuel poverty, and that
                will have a knock-on effect on education and health.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Poverty and social exclusion are among the
                worst indictments of our society, and unless real resources are
                channelled into the Department of Social Development the
                problems that have plagued the vulnerable in communities — the
                elderly, children, single parents — will continue.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Carrick:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I draw attention to the reduction in
                budgetary provision for watercourse management and flooding.
                Although there has been a £1·76 million reduction in the
                running costs of the Rivers Agency, capital provision has been
                increased by £1·56 million.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What provision has been made for the
                recommendations that will stem from the Lough Neagh management
                strategy? I refer particularly to the urgent need for flood
                control measures along the River Bann basin. It is vital that
                the plight of farmers and landowners be given the same weighting
                and consideration in respect of their production land as will be
                given to commercial fishing, tourism, recreation and
                conservation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is time that the Assembly showed some
                teeth in dealing with cross-cutting issues. Resources must be
                made available to address the raft of issues associated with the
                management and exploitation of our natural assets, especially
                Lough Neagh, which has been neglected over the past 50 years. An
                example of such neglect is the discharge of Lurgan sewage and
                effluent into Kinnego Bay via the Woodvale River over the past
                60 years. There is evidence that the water quality in the
                harbour is poor and that there has been a build-up of silt on
                the bed of the harbour.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Resources are required for the removal of the
                contaminated layer on the lough bed. It must be removed if water
                quality is to recover. The relevant Department has been
                reluctant to clean up the harbour bed. If we hold to the view
                that the polluter pays, we must find the resources to enable
                that Department to carry out the work — if we wish to promote
                the lough for recreational and tourist purposes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition to improving the water quality in
                the lough, there is the need to address the whole system of
                feeder rivers and watercourses in a strategic manner and examine
                new engineering solutions to alleviate flooding of agricultural
                land. A comprehensive study should encompass the economic cost
                benefits of releasing potential development land, especially
                around Portadown, which hitherto has blighted and stunted the
                natural growth of the town. I call on the relevant Department
                and on the Minister of Finance and Personnel to find the vital
                resources to enable that work to be carried out. We need to
                promote our greatest natural asset — Lough Neagh — as an
                attraction that will bring tourists and allow people to enjoy
                the recreational facilities and at the same time allow the
                farming community to enjoy the full use of their production
                land. We are not talking about taking additional wetlands into
                production; we are talking about preserving the traditional
                production land.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will just touch on the issue of fraud and
                the haemorrhage from the public purse to which my colleague
                Seamus Close referred this morning. His comments have my full
                support. If additional administrative costs identified in the
                Minister’s statement are being directed to reduce fraud and
                block that haemorrhage, the Assembly will be doing the citizens
                of Northern Ireland a good turn.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate the Minister on the Budget
                statement and the wide ranging issues dealt with in it. Members
                have already covered the points I wished to make, so I will
                simply outline my comments, which, I hope, will be linked to the
                others.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to education, I ask again where
                the moneys will be allocated for the implementation of the Burns
                review. I support the idea that resources will be given to all
                young people, through participation at school, so that they can
                reach the highest possible standards of educational
                achievements. I ask the Minister to encourage the Minister of
                Health, Social Services and Public Safety and the Minister of
                Education to ring-fence resources for the provision of
                non-teaching staff for special schools. We have been campaigning
                for that for some time, and no definite action has been taken so
                far. Children are suffering on a daily basis. I did compliment
                the action programme for education in the Programme for
                Government, and I hope the moneys are found to implement those
                proposals fully.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the Office of the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister, as a Committee of the Centre member I
                have to say that I would like an outline of specific resources.
                The many different remits — from human rights to victims,
                including the whole process of equality legislation — must
                have moneys available. Will there, for example, be adequate
                money available to implement the Bloomfield Report? Will the
                Equality Commission have enough money to enable it to carry out
                its important remit?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have to support Mr Poots, who commented
                this morning on libraries provision. Of course, in my case, I
                would put forward Bangor library as an urgent priority because
                of the state of the building. I am aware that the Minister has
                promised action, but I want to use this opportunity to highlight
                again the conditions and the use of the library.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the funding allocated to the
                Department for Social Development for voluntary bodies and
                community groups. However, I again urge the Ministers in the
                Department of Finance and Personnel and the Office of the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister to expedite the core
                funding under Peace II with our European partners.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Colleague has spoken about the roads
                situation. I want to touch on the railways situation. That is
                one issue where there is all-party consensus. I ask again that
                we let people — especially those who travel on the railways
                — know exactly how the Department for Regional Development’s
                money will be allocated and spent.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also express my disgust at the destructive
                actions on Saturday on the Belfast to Dublin railway line. If
                the people who disrupted the services felt they would destroy
                the feeling of camaraderie and friendship on both sides of the
                border, they were wrong. The team — thank goodness — and the
                thousands of supporters won through. I hope that the Minister
                will show strong support to Translink for its handling of the
                situation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I finish by stating my support for my
                Colleague’s remarks on the timetabling of the exercise and the
                need for more consultation. Notwithstanding that, however, I
                congratulate the Minister and his Department on their work on
                the Budget process. It is a complicated process, and, as time
                goes on, we will, I hope, get it right.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We may still have concerns about the process,
                but the Estimates and Vote on Account show clearly the advantage
                of a devolved Assembly. We, as Assembly Members, can see the
                ways in which the money is being spent and how we can be
                answerable and accountable to our voters.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the two motions.</p>

              Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland Office recently announced a
              support package of £1m for that organisation. Victim Support
              Northern Ireland and the Northern Ireland Office are responsible

              allocation of £6·67 million under Peace II funding to support
              victims is adequate in comparison with the cost to date of over
              £33·8 million for the Saville inquiry? Will the Deputy First
              Minister ensure that Peace II money reaches the real victims of

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am afraid that, with regard to this, the
              Assembly Member is comparing apples with pears. The reality is
              that no one in the devolved Administration has any responsibility
              for the Bloody Sunday tribunal. Our efforts should be directed to
              ensuring that money available for victims from Europe is used to
              the best effect.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to the question of funding for
              victims’ groups, the devolved Administration is aware that the
              victims of violent action have been one of the most neglected
              sections in society over the past three decades. The Executive
              intend to ensure that, alongside other organisations operating in
              this field, victims’ groups have the capacity to access support
              and funding opportunities from Government, European and other
              sources.</p>

              The closing date for applications for funding under Peace I was 31
              December 1999, and therefore no money remains in Peace I for

              out then. For instance, an Armagh woman whose husband was shot had
              five sons. They received £500 each, which was an insult. Will the
              Deputy First Minister keep that in mind, and can that be rectified

              who choose to remain outside victims’ groups are not forgotten
              and, secondly, that those in victims’ groups will have the
              capacity and financial resources to develop the type of support

              refer to the Ministers’ areas of responsibility. There is a
              tendency for Members to go outside that and ask for opinions.
              There are other contexts where that is entirely appropriate, but
              in this context questions are supposed to refer to ministerial

              the Executive in respect of developing and implementing EU
              strategy. That is likely to involve direct relations between the
              office and the 11 Departments, and it will entail detailed input
              into particular policy areas. I can assure Mr Fee that the office
              will also play a role in promoting Northern Ireland’s wider
              interests in the EU, and, as part of that role, it will seek to

              Affairs, Monsieur Moscovici, they did not focus on French issues;
              they focused on European issues and our role in Europe. We have
              much to offer other regions in Europe, especially those
              experiencing ethnic conflict. Therefore, it is important that we
              encourage all public representatives to engage in the wider issues
              of Europe, and I have no doubt that the office, when it is fully
              opened and staffed, will be able to assist all Assembly Members in

              the victims’ spokespersons of political parties. The leaflet set
              out the responsibilities of the respective units and each of the

              unacceptable insofar as he says that while Committees in the

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand the point that the Member makes,
              and if permanent secretaries were attempting to limit the
              statutory position or proper role of Committees in any way, that
              would, of course, be quite wrong. However, the situation evolved
              in a slightly different way. The consultations to which I refer
              came before and not after the memo in question. There is no
              intention, in any way, to limit the proper role of the Committees.
              The Committees are mentioned in the agreement itself, where we
              agreed that Committees will have a scrutiny, policy development
              and consultation role with respect to the Department with which
              each is associated. That provision in the agreement is embodied in
              the legislation and, in particular, in the power of the Committees
              to send for papers.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That legal power is accepted by permanent
              secretaries. How it is to be exercised to enable the relationship
              involving the Assembly, the Committees and the Departments to run
              smoothly is a matter of detail to be looked at. I refer the Member
              to the protocols which have been developed in Wales and Scotland
              to spell out that relationship in more detail. It is not a matter
              of undermining the Committees — that would be quite wrong —
              but of trying to ensure a smooth and harmonious relationship. Any
              impression given by the memorandum that the objective was
              otherwise is misleading.</p>

              Minister who refuses to sit down with his Executive colleagues,
              does the First Minister agree that there is a need to agree
              conventions so that the Assembly can function properly and all

              agree that, notwithstanding what is in the agreement, the natural
              inclination of Ministers, and particularly of their officials, is
              to sideline the views of Committees as far as possible?</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was clearly in the minds of those who
              negotiated the agreement — and in the minds of those who then
              translated it into legislation — that the Committees of the
              Assembly should have an important status that would go beyond that
              of a Westminster Select Committee. In referring to policy
              development, the Member has put his finger directly on that point.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is fair to say that most Ministers try to
              work closely with the Committees when discussing and developing
              policies. We commend that approach because it limits any scope
              that there might be for friction in the relationship. But there is
              a difference in viewpoints between the Minister and Committee
              members, so we should not be surprised if different opinions occur
              from time to time. As with so many other things, we have to work
              through this rather unusual arrangement because the position of
              our Committees differs from that of the Westminster Committees. We
              have to work through that and, in doing so, developing our own
              protocols and precedents on how we proceed could be a useful
              exercise.</p>

              treatment is the cornerstone of the Department’s approach to
              language. Ulster Scots is recognised by Part&nbsp;II of the
              Council of Europe’s charter. However, Ulster Scots and Irish are
              at different stages of development, but Tha Boord o Ulster-Scotch
              is confident that its language will achieve Part&nbsp;III status
              in 10&nbsp;years. That is an ambitious target, but it is serious.
              I must point out that, since devolution, funding for Ulster Scots

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Battle of Moira was one of the most
              significant battles in early Irish history. It was significant in
              three respects: politically, ecclesiastically and culturally. It
              was significant politically because, following the battle, the old
              links with Scotland were broken. In fact, you might say that the
              first union was dissolved. It was significant ecclesiastically

              Connor in Antrim, where it was formed, to Armagh, which became the

              Seamus Heaney’s great work ‘Sweeney Astray’. The Minister
              must agree that he would be contributing to cultural education if
              his Department recognised events such as the Battle of Moira as
              historic, rather than historical. Would it not help the
              development of a shared sense of identity for future generations
              in Northern Ireland if we paid more attention to those events
              which have not been trademarked by mural painters? That could

              Battle of Moira had no particular significance. I now stand
              corrected by the remarks that Dr Adamson has just made. I am aware
              that it is one of many battles fought over the centuries between
              the Uí Néill and the Ulaid. I also recognise that it has a
              significance. What I have ascertained actually came from a book
              that Dr Adamson edited. The historic significance of a battle in
              637 AD needs to be better represented and explained before we
              begin to commemorate it. It is clearly something that Dr Adamson
              feels strongly about. There are obviously resonances, both within
              the Chamber and without.</p>

              about the significance of the historic battle, will the Minister,
              in the interests of efficiency, consider setting up a committee of
              one — namely, Dr Adamson — to make preparations for the
              commemoration of the battle? Will he further require him to report
              12 months before the date of that commemoration and to make his
              report in the language in common use at that time?</p>

              tongue-in-cheek. It is important to recognise that some 10 years
              ago Dr Adamson was instrumental in having an interpretative panel
              commemorating this battle unveiled inside the Moira demesne.
              Unfortunately, the panel was vandalised and has not been replaced.
              Lisburn Borough Council may have a role in replacing it. I would
              not begin to suggest that Mr Doherty was the one who vandalised

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will investigate that matter, and if we come
              up with something, I will communicate with Mr&nbsp;Hussey. The
              Department expects around £4&nbsp;million of Peace II funding
              over five&nbsp;years to be spent on water-based tourism. As one
              would expect, funding will be allocated against set criteria. Bids
              that come forward from West Tyrone will determine its allocation;
              I cannot predict what will go to West Tyrone until bidding starts.
              Funding has not yet begun, so bids from West Tyrone are premature.</p>

              That includes promoting a greater understanding of and respect for

              National Museums and Galleries of Northern Ireland (MAGNI) and
              local museums have an important part to play in the process. MAGNI
              is required by statute to promote awareness, appreciation and
              understanding of people’s culture and way of life with
              particular regard to the heritage of Northern Ireland. That
              approach is reflected, for example, in its current Icons of
              Identity exhibitions and its work to commemorate the Act of Union.
              It also plans, as it said in its vision statement, to tell the

              history and heritage of Northern Ireland.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was aware that imports of SRM were taking
              place. However, it was derived from animals slaughtered for human
              consumption, and none was derived from condemned animals.
              Processed SRM from Monery By-Products — now called Monery 2000
              Ltd — in County Cavan was exported from the Republic of Ireland
              to Northern Ireland for landfill at the Tullyvar site at
              Aughnacloy. The imports were under licence from my Department and
              took place from July&nbsp;1999 until December&nbsp;2000.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">New European Union rules on SRM were introduced
              by the European Commission on 29&nbsp;June&nbsp;2000 through
              Commission decision 2000/418. That decision, which came into force
              on 1&nbsp;October&nbsp;2000, made it illegal to export SRM to
              another member state, except for the purposes of incineration. As
              the Republic of Ireland authorities lacked the necessary landfill
              facilities to deal with the material, they requested that the
              trade continue beyond 1&nbsp;October 2000 while they sought a
              derogation from the Commission. That approach was unsuccessful,
              and the Republic of Ireland authorities immediately stopped the
              trade in December&nbsp;2000. No further trade has occurred since.</p>

              EU regulations that prohibit the transfer of such material? In
              complying with the regulation, has the Department of Agriculture
              and Rural Development admitted that the material was SRM? Can the
              Minister confirm that Monery 2000 Ltd is a designated plant for
              SRM? Was one day’s notice given to allow a veterinary inspection
              to be carried out every time consignments for Aughnacloy were
              dispatched? Can the Minister be satisfied with the integrity of
              licences for such material, given that Mr&nbsp;Fox from the Irish

              have heard them all correctly, but I will do my best to answer. If
              I miss one, I will respond in writing.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, the imported material is buried at
              Tullyvar, and it will remained buried. It was processed to the
              required EU standard before burial. The processing reduced any
              risk from BSE to negligible proportions. Prior to import, the SRM
              was processed to standards laid down by the Commission —
              decision 96/449/EC, which requires the material to be heated to a
              core temperature of 133°C for 20&nbsp;minutes at a pressure of 3
              bar. The particle size of the raw material prior to processing
              must be reduced to at most 50&nbsp;mm by means of a pre-breaker or
              grinder.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I further reassure the Member that imports were
              subject to strict veterinary controls laid down in the licence
              granted by my Department. Those controls required processing
              before import to the required EU standard; advance notice of the
              import; veterinary certification by the Republic of Ireland
              authorities that the material had been processed to the required
              EU standard; transportation in sealed, leak-proof containers to
              arrive during working hours; and containers and vehicles to be
              cleansed and disinfected before leaving the Tullyvar landfill
              site. There were also veterinary checks of the consignments on
              their arrival at Tullyvar to ensure that those conditions had been
              met.</p>

              contaminated — is being stored throughout Northern Ireland. Does

              were not able, under the EU free-trade regulations, to refuse such
              material. That was the case until the EU changed the regulation
              and stipulated that such material should not be transported from
              one country to another. At that time the Republic of Ireland
              sought a derogation, and while that was taking place the practice
              was allowed to continue. However, as soon as the derogation was

              getting into the watercourse, the Spongiform Encephalopathy
              Advisory Committee (SEAC) — an independent scientific advisory

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand that the Commission aims to bring
              forward proposals for the reform of the sheepmeat regime for
              discussion at the next Agriculture Council meeting in March.
              Knowing this, we have been pressing the case from a UK and
              Northern Ireland point of view. Indeed, my officials attended a
              meeting with the Commission on 10 January to discuss the matter.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That proved useful, and the Commission was
              advised of the importance of the sheep premium to sheepmeat
              producers, and in particular of the less favoured areas supplement
              to hill farmers, who suffer from a lack of alternative
              agricultural activities. The Commission officials were also told
              that, while we were keen to see the regime simplified — and can
              see advantage in a move to a flat rate premium because it would
              introduce a degree of certainty into the regime for producers —
              any flat rate must be fair. We will be following developments
              closely.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The recent announcement regarding the regime
              seems to indicate that Brussels wants to replace variable premiums
              with fixed headage premiums. I do not know how we will be able to
              deal with that. However, does the Minister agree on the importance
              of a much higher flat rate than has been the case recently?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Rodgers:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am aware of the falling value of the sheep
              annual premium in recent years. That has been due partly to the
              strength of sterling, but also to the differential between the
              market values in the rest of Europe and the UK — and Northern
              Ireland in particular — which means that our subsidy is less. In
              fact, a flat rate has been suggested by the Scottish college that
              carried out a study on behalf of the Commission. The farmers and I
              would be happy to see a flat rate introduced, and it is a
              possibility. It would need to be set at a much higher rate,
              because recently the annual sheep premium has gradually decreased
              every year, and that is clearly unacceptable from our point of
              view.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Income figures for Northern Ireland, which were
              published on 31&nbsp;January&nbsp;2001, show that, at the
              aggregate level, the total income from farming and the return to
              farmers and all their family members working on farms rose by 6%
              to £98&nbsp;million — 3% in real terms — in 2000.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the individual farm level, it is forecast
              that the average net farm income will have increased by
              approximately £3,000 per farm in 2000-01, with improvements in
              all farm types other than cereals. In the cases of general
              cropping, in less favoured areas, cattle and sheep, pigs and
              poultry and mixed farms’ average incomes are expected to return
              to profit from loss. However, the average income from lowland
              cattle and sheep farms is expected to have remained negative,
              despite some improvement.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although I welcome this improvement, however
              slight, incomes remain low by historical standards. The figures
              reflect the serious problems experienced by the agriculture
              industry in Northern Ireland in recent years. The weak euro has
              been the primary cause of the industry’s difficulties. The
              payment of agrimonetary compensation, worth almost
              £14&nbsp;million to Northern Ireland in 2000, has been an
              important element in bolstering incomes. While the increase in
              agriculture income is small, it represents a hopeful sign that the
              worst of the income difficulties may be over.</p>

              be it sheep, beef, dairy, poultry, cereals, or whatever. The news
              that the Minister gave is extremely welcome, but is it her
              Department’s assessment that the recession in agriculture has
              finally bottomed out, and what are its predictions for farm
              incomes over the next few years?</p>
              <b>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with Mr Fee about the difficult times
              that the farming community has been through from an income point
              of view. I would like to think that they have bottomed out.
              However, much will depend on future movements in the sterling/euro
              exchange rate. There are now some grounds for mild optimism in the
              short to medium term. They include the recent strengthening of the
              euro and the generally improved prices currently prevailing for
              several commodities compared to those in the early part of last
              year. However, there has been another slight decrease in some
              prices in recent days.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Against that, the BSE problem in other EU
              countries has the potential to have a negative impact on beef
              prices in the British Isles. It will clearly have an effect on our
              market, and that is why I will argue for the payment of all
              agrimoney compensation while it is still available.</p>

              a fall of 105%.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, in relation to what I can do to
              address it, as I have already said, I will lobby for the full
              agrimonetary compensation to be paid. I am looking at every
              measure that we can take to improve marketing, skills and the
              quality of beef. There are issues beyond my control, such as the
              effect that the present BSE situation is having on the markets in
              continental Europe with the consequent domino effect in Northern
              Ireland. In that situation, I can only appeal to the good sense of
              consumers to exercise choice when buying and for retailers also to
              play their part.</p>

              grant paid to organic farmers in Northern Ireland and the Republic

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Rodgers:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am seeking to encourage the development of a
              vibrant organic sector in Northern Ireland. Under the Northern
              Ireland Rural Development Plan 2000-06, £9 million has been made
              available for a new organic farming scheme, which will be open to
              applicants from 1 March 2001. Those resources will enable the
              scheme to grow from its present level of 20 producers farming just
              over 1,000 hectares to 1,000 farmers with 30,000 hectares under
              agreement by 2006.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Payments to producers under the organic farming
              scheme will total, over a period of five years, £450 a hectare
              for land eligible for the arable area payment scheme (AAPS) and
              for land in permanent crops. Payments of £350 a hectare will be
              made for improved land not eligible for that scheme, with £50 a
              hectare for unimproved grassland or rough grazing land. Most of
              the payments will be made in the first two years, and producers
              will also receive lump sums of £300 in the first year, £200 in
              the second and £100 in the third year towards the initial costs
              of advice and training.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the Republic of Ireland, under the rural
              environment protection scheme (REPS), organic farmers receive
              annual payments of 181 euros (approximately £110) a hectare for
              land in conversion and 91 euros (approximately £55) a hectare for
              land fully converted, up to a maximum of 40 hectares. The REPS
              agreement is for five years, but it can be renewed with payments
              for fully converted land continuing at the lower rate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The need for ongoing payments to organic
              farmers is likely to emerge in the report on the strategic study
              of the organic sector, which is being completed. I will study any
              such recommendations carefully, though there is no financial
              provision for any such payments.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for detailing what is
              currently paid, but she did not refer to the fact that the UK is
              the only country in the EU that does not make provision for
              ongoing payments under the organic aid scheme, or something
              similar. Does she accept that Northern Ireland producers have
              particular problems, given the land border with a member state
              that pays such an ongoing grant? Does she also accept that there
              is a real danger that farmers in Northern Ireland could convert to
              organic production because of the current level of grant and
              subsequently be undercut by producers elsewhere in Europe unless
              there is ongoing support?</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A study of the organic farming scheme is
              currently taking place. I am willing consider the report that I
              will get from those consultants following their strategic study of
              the Northern Ireland organic sector. I am open-minded on the
              issue, and I await that study’s recommendations. I also have to
              bear in mind — and I remind Mr Ford of this — that resources
              will always be a problem, but I will do what I can to deal with
              the issue.</p>

              </font></b><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I listened with great interest to the points
              that have been raised by Members. Members’ participation has
              fully reflected the opening comments of the Speaker this morning
              about the debate providing an opportunity to raise matters of
              interest or concern to them. Twenty-one Members took that
              opportunity, and that reflects the high number of Members who
              contributed in earlier Budget debates.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Finance and Personnel
              Committee, Mr Molloy, mentioned his concern about the process for
              Assembly consideration of the financial cycle. That same theme was
              picked up by other Members, including Alex Maskey, Seamus Close,
              Monica McWilliams, William Hay, Gardiner Kane and George Savage.
              Their criticisms and concerns are noted and will form an important
              part of considering how improvements can be made. I assure Members
              that the issue will be carefully considered.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are practical and timing issues, but it
              is the aim of the Department of Finance and Personnel to ensure
              that Committees have a greater role and involvement in
              scrutinising the financial proposals and performance of their
              Departments and that the Finance and Personnel Committee is as
              fully involved as possible at an early stage.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand Members’ concerns, and I will
              not attempt to argue that the processes that have been followed so
              far have been adequate, much less perfect. As I have emphasised
              repeatedly to the Finance and Personnel Committee, the timetable
              for each monitoring round is constrained, but there is room for
              more discussion with the Committees before a result is achieved. I
              will explore further how that best can be facilitated.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I have told Committee members on
              several occasions that they are free to ask questions at the
              various stages of the processes that are now culminating in the
              Estimates. That applies for discussions about the annual Budget as
              well as for each monitoring round. Committee members need not
              await a procedural starting gun from me to begin scrutiny and
              questioning. The Department of Finance and Personnel has not
              turned down any requests for information or elaboration, and I
              would be surprised if any Department had done so.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Concerns have been raised today that people
              have not had enough time to consider the Estimates. The Estimates
              cover allocations previously announced in monitoring rounds and in
              the second set of Estimates in the Budget. Committees have had
              information available to them that they could pursue with relevant
              Departments or question the Department of Finance and Personnel
              about. Committees have been quite free to pursue the sort of
              questions that were raised today through the channels available to
              them, based on the information that they had from the previous
              monitoring decisions and the previous Budget proposals.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am aware of the views that were specifically
              articulated by Mr&nbsp;Close about the adequacy of the role of the
              Assembly and its Committees in contributing to thinking on the
              allocation of resources and the scrutiny of detailed Estimates. I
              cannot be unconditional in responding to those arguments. The
              Executive have a clear responsibility in the process. However,
              given Mr&nbsp;Close’s views and the views of others, I am
              willing to consider how we can close the gap he described. I will
              take the views of the Finance and Personnel Committee on the
              matter. We need dialogue to enable a better all-round
              understanding of the constraints and the opportunities to refine
              and improve what happens. That is not just in the interests of the
              Assembly and the Executive, but in the interests of the public.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In response to the Finance and Personnel
              Committee’s report, the Executive plan to bring forward the
              draft Budget as early as possible after the summer recess. That
              was underlined again today by Mr&nbsp;Molloy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the comments of several Members,
              including Mr&nbsp;Leslie and Ms&nbsp;McWilliams, on the
              introduction of resource accounting and budgeting and the related
              work on the development of public service agreements, which
              Mr&nbsp;Maskey welcomed. Those are important steps forward for
              improving financial and operational management in Departments.
              They will further enhance the accountability of Departments to the
              Assembly and address many of the concerns raised by Members in
              that regard.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For example, better information should be
              available on the true costs of services, the position of the
              Department against budget and, more importantly, progress against
              the delivery of departmental objectives that the Assembly wants to
              see. Those developments provide further opportunities to enhance
              the scope of the Assembly and its Committees in playing a major
              role in the development of the spending plans.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will attempt to answer as many of the Members’
              points as possible. However, it would not be appropriate for me to
              make definitive responses on some issues that are currently
              subject to other processes, such as consideration by the Public
              Accounts Committee.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to stress that the spending plans of 11
              Departments, which cover a very wide range of public services,
              change materially as each year progresses. At each point, whether
              setting the original Budget or in each monitoring round, we make
              the best estimates possible at the time and judge what can be
              committed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thus, while the pattern has been that we have
              needed Supplementary Estimates of 2% to 2·5% of the Main
              Estimates provision, that arises through a different combination
              of factors in each year that cannot be predicted at the start of
              the year. However, it would be wrong to assume that that implies
              that there is always money available and that we can afford to do
              more than we have announced.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive have faced hard choices, and that
              will continue to be the case as we go forward. Mr&nbsp;Molloy
              acknowledged our role in reallocating resources and welcomed the
              reduction in the regional rate from that originally proposed.
              Other Members, including Mr&nbsp;Poots, also touched on that
              point. He asked us to keep under review our scope to raise income
              through other means. We will do that, although Mr&nbsp;Molloy will
              be aware that the opportunities to add to resources from local
              revenues are very limited.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the review of the regional rate will
              be thorough and wide-ranging. That is the place to explore the
              concerns that Mr Molloy, Mr Poots, Mr Close and others have raised
              about various aspects of the regional rate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to emphasise that, as I explained last
              week, we acted on the rates increases as soon as action was
              possible, as had been promised all along. Given the many requests
              for additional funding that we have heard today in the course of
              the debate, I have to repeat that we need the revenue from the
              rates. We need not damage the case we need to make to the Treasury
              on the Barnett formula. Now is not the time to address the Barnett
              issue in full, but I note and welcome the comments that several
              Members made on it. I take Mr Molloy’s point, also referred to
              by Mr Maskey, about the product of the Barnett formula in relation
              to our needs. That will be addressed with determination.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is worth saying that the interests of
              Scotland and Wales may not coincide with our own, and we cannot
              presume that there can be a united approach on the subject just
              because we desire one.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Leslie’s cautious observations about the
              nature of the challenge on Barnett should be well taken. However,
              the 2000 spending review highlighted the inadequacies of the
              Barnett mechanism in funding the devolved regions. I have made
              representations to the Chancellor and the Chief Secretary of the
              Treasury, as have the First Minister and the Deputy First
              Minister, on the issue. It is imperative that the problem be
              resolved before the next spending review. The full introduction of
              resource accounting and budgeting means that it is imperative that
              the Treasury recognises the level of need in Northern Ireland and
              the structural differences between Northern Ireland’s and Great
              Britain’s public sectors.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Molloy raised the question of whether our
              approach to determining Votes on Account in future will be based
              on a percentage of estimated spend rather than the previous year’s
              expenditure. That will be determined in the light of experience,
              but obviously, and most importantly, we do not wish to seek
              approval for an inadequate resource for the period to be covered.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie referred to the management
              development programme, as did Ms McWilliams. Reduced requirements
              have been declared on that programme, because some schemes were
              insufficiently developed to allow them to run in the current year.
              However, schemes that are in operation are running at almost full
              capacity.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department expects all planned schemes to
              run at or near full capacity next year. Dr&nbsp;Birnie also
              mentioned recruitment to the work track programme — another
              point taken up by Ms&nbsp;McWilliams. Recruitment to that
              programme has been slower than expected. When the programme
              started in August 1999, the Department estimated that capacity
              would build up to 1,050 places early in 2000-01. At present 850
              people are in the programme, and recruitment is continuing.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots raised points on several areas,
              including wastage and fraud in the Health Service, victims, urban
              regeneration, Department of the Environment funding, road
              maintenance and the Antrim to Knockmore railway line.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I attach a high priority to ensuring that
              wastage and fraud, in any service, are rigorously addressed. The
              Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety is also
              determined to prevent, detect and pursue fraud anywhere in the
              health and personal social services. To that end, it has
              implemented a broad-based action plan to counter both
              patient-based and practitioner-based fraud and plans to extend
              counter-fraud measures to the wider Health Service.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On Mr Poots’s comments on victims, and in
              reply to concerns from Ms Bell, I can say that the Executive
              attach a high priority to their needs. Detailed proposals for the
              expenditure are still to be finalised, but it will be important to
              ensure that the £320,000 allocated to the Victims Unit will be
              used as efficiently and effectively as possible. We should also
              bear in mind that funding will be complementary to a further
              allocation of £6·7 million available from Peace II later this
              year.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.15 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive are committed to the pursuit of
              policies that directly address divisions in the community. We are
              following policies and supporting practical measures that will,
              over time, help to ease community divisions and thereby reinforce
              new political institutions commanding widespread public support.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also note the comments about urban
              regeneration. That is primarily for the Minister for Social
              Development. While welcoming the in-year increases for historic
              buildings, road safety officers, planners, and so on in the
              Department of the Environment, Edwin Poots pressed the need for
              further resources for the Environment and Heritage Service to
              implement European environment Directives. The Executive and the
              Assembly have recognised that need by providing an extra £9
              million in next year’s Budget.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots, William Hay, Kieran McCarthy and
              Gerry McHugh all stressed the need for further investment in roads
              maintenance. The additional allocations made in the December
              monitoring indicate that the Executive are aware of the need, in
              the context of available resources and competing priorities. Mr
              Hay’s points on the slippage in roads capital expenditure are a
              matter for the Minister for Regional Development.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots, Mr Close and Mr Hay raised the
              question of the Antrim to Knockmore railway after the Bleach Green
              line reopens. That is initially a matter for the Minister for
              Regional Development, but I must point out that the appraisal that
              underpinned the reopening of the Bleach Green line was based on
              the Knockmore line closing.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Delays in the provision of a new library for
              Lisburn occurred because of the lack of a suitable site. The
              favoured site had difficulties attached to it in the form of
              rights of way, but those have now been resolved, and the South
              Eastern Education and Library Board will complete its purchase.
              Provision of a library for Lisburn by conventional means would
              cost approximately £3 million. Adoption of such a route would
              have an adverse impact on the Department’s library development
              programme. The Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure is
              finalising the outline business case for the project, and it
              expects to allow the board to proceed with the PFI solution in the
              near future.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots also raised the issue of the gas
              industry. The Executive are keen that the natural gas industry be
              extended outside the greater Belfast area. However, the
              development of a natural gas industry in the south east —
              Craigavon, Newry and Banbridge — depends on the private sector
              constructing a gas pipeline between the Republic and Northern
              Ireland. Proposals by British Gas Keyspan to construct a
              North/South pipeline from Belfast to Dublin have become less
              attractive due to the possible introduction of a public service
              levy on all new gas pipelines in the South and their failure to
              sign firm long-term contracts with major gas users — the power
              stations.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dallat raised the matter of Audit Office
              funding. In that connection, most of the additional powers arising
              from the Government Resources and Accounts Bill are discretionary
              or permissive and are not expected to have immediate spending
              consequences. Funding for the Northern Ireland Audit Office will
              be kept under review but will not be impeded by my Department.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was pleased to note the welcome given by many
              Members to the Assembly’s increasing role in making its own
              decisions about financial allocations. The decisions taken
              following monitoring rounds reflect our judgement of such matters
              based on available information and views that have been expressed.
              I note the support for increased allocations for social purposes
              in the health, education and disability areas, as expressed by
              Patricia Lewsley, and the general support of Esmond Birnie for the
              Supplementary Estimates, linked to the proper view that money must
              be spent efficiently.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The question was raised as to why we should
              further invest in temporary school accommodation when the need is
              for longer-term provision of adequate facilities. That is a valid
              point. Inevitably we must secure an acceptable level of
              accommodation while the longer-term issues, which will require
              substantive funding, are addressed. Although we cannot resolve all
              of the shortcomings in capital provision in the short term, they
              will have a full place in our collective deliberations about
              priorities and needs as we progress through the next financial
              year.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Seamus Close typically covered a considerable
              amount of ground in his contribution to the debate. I have
              answered some of those points already, although I am certain that
              I will not be able to respond to his satisfaction on every point.
              I compliment him on the close scrutiny that he has given to the
              spring Supplementary Estimates booklet. All the time constraints
              about which he complained did not diminish his capacity in that
              regard.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Close also referred to the need for
              extra expenditure to bring forward the preparation of area plans
              and to implement the proposed Knockmore-to-Sprucefield road link.
              The spring Supplementary Estimates provide additional resources in
              this year for the preparation of area plans, as does the Budget
              for next year. The Knockmore-Sprucefield road link is a matter for
              the Minister for Regional Development to prioritise in his overall
              road capital budget.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the matter of superannuation, a total of
              £97,951,000 is required to meet redundancy and early retirement
              costs, of which £91,426,000 is in respect of Prison Service
              redundancy schemes. The Prison Service costs have been fully
              offset by the Northern Ireland Office from moneys provided by the
              Treasury. The remaining £6·5&nbsp;million costs relate to a few
              minor schemes, the most notable covering Government training
              centre instructors.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Resources for Irish-medium education were
              referred to by some Members, namely Mr&nbsp;Poots and
              Mr&nbsp;McHugh. Some were in favour while others were in some
              doubt. There are clear commitments in the Belfast Agreement to
              supporting the Irish language and integrated education as measures
              to embed parity of esteem and reconciliation. Pluralism and real
              choice should mean that parents do not have to bear unnecessary
              financial burdens. It should also mean that the smaller sectors
              have a realistic chance to develop, not only in large population
              centres, such as Belfast and Derry, but across rural areas.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The matter of clinical negligence was mentioned
              by Ms&nbsp;McWilliams. The Department of Health, Social Services
              and Public Safety is required to meet agreed settlements for
              clinical negligence in full. Total provision of
              £7·9&nbsp;million has been made in 2000-01. Of this,
              £4·9&nbsp;million has been provided by health boards from their
              Main Estimate provision and £3&nbsp;million by the Executive in
              December monitoring. £5&nbsp;million is earmarked to meet
              anticipated claims in 2001-02, but that figure will need to be
              kept under review.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Prof&nbsp;McWilliams also referred to the
              Springvale project and PFI. I note her comments about the latter.
              However, the institutions are taking steps to set up a private
              finance initiative project board and to engage consultants to
              complete the outline business case. Building work has commenced on
              the community outreach centre, and an official European Community
              notice will be issued shortly, inviting tenders for the building
              of the applied research centre.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main Springvale campus had been to open in
              September 2003. Following some legal and technical issues, which
              have taken time to resolve, the opening of the main campus has
              been deferred by one year, until September 2004. The in-year
              easement results from that delay.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Roads Service winter gritting was mentioned by
              Gerry McHugh and — I suppose from a slightly different angle —
              by Kieran McCarthy, as was Health Service expenditure. The
              detailed allocation of roads maintenance funding is a matter for
              the Minister for Regional Development, but I understand that
              gritting is undertaken in accordance with a programme based on the
              volume of traffic using a road, rather than its location.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As regards health, the Executive are concerned
              to ensure that Health Service expenditure is managed as
              effectively and efficiently as possible. Following the Executive’s
              agreement to my proposals to resolve the Health Service deficits
              through an injection of £18 million of additional funding, it was
              also agreed that the Department of Finance and Personnel, the
              Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety and the
              Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister should
              oversee a joint consultancy exercise. The origins — and the
              consequences — of the recent growth of deficits in the health
              and personal social services boards and trusts would be examined,
              as would the effectiveness of new arrangements recently put in
              place by the Department of Health, Social Services and Public
              Safety to ensure improved transparency and accountability.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Members, including Francie Molloy, Alex
              Maskey, William Hay, Michelle Gildernew and Patricia Lewsley,
              raised the matter of gap funding between Peace I and Peace II.
              Most welcomed the provision. I am fully aware of the difficulties
              faced by the community and voluntary sector in sustaining
              activities during the gap between Peace I and Peace II funding. In
              the current financial year the Executive have made gap funding
              available to address the problem. However, it is also widely
              recognised that gap funding is no substitute for having Peace II
              funding in place.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On 12 February, I announced to the Assembly
              that Departments would be authorised to make advance payments for
              projects that they judge will be eligible for funding and
              successful in an application under Peace II. In reply to Michelle
              Gildernew, I emphasise that the criteria used will be those that
              will apply to Peace II funding. They have been developed after
              detailed discussion involving all Departments.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some judgement will be required as Departments
              apply the criteria. The safety net I mentioned on 12 February will
              help deal with the risk that there might be some cases where
              Departments assist a project in the short term, which does not in
              the end prove eligible for funding under Peace II. Two million
              pounds have been set aside under the Executive programme fund for
              social inclusion and community regeneration, with the aim of
              ensuring that the issue is fully dealt with.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Gerry McHugh mentioned libraries in rural
              areas. The Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure plans to carry
              out a review of the public library service that, among other
              things, will examine the extent to which it meets the needs of its
              clients, both as individuals and as communities. Individual
              allocations to education and library boards are made on the basis
              of an assessment of relative needs. That takes account of the home
              population in each board area. It is a matter for each education
              and library board to decide whether the public is better served by
              a static or mobile library. At present, there are 25 mobile
              libraries providing public services, and eight providing a service
              specifically for the housebound.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While welcoming the additional resources for
              roads and transport programmes in the Budget for 2001-02, Alban
              Maginness asked that more funding be provided for roads
              maintenance. As I said, the Executive are very aware of the need
              to maintain the roads infrastructure. We must look to the
              forthcoming regional transportation strategy to consider how our
              transport investment needs can be afforded in the context of the
              limited resources available.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.30 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Maginness also raised a question on water
              and sewerage funding. He asked me to increase investment in water
              and sewerage services in particular. As Chairperson of the
              Regional Development Committee, he recognised that an additional
              £14·5 million was included in the 2001-02 Budget, approved by
              the Assembly in December. Beyond that, water bids on the Executive
              programme funds will of course be considered. In the future, it
              will be for the Assembly to consider the level of investment
              necessary in water and sewerage services and how best they can be
              funded, given the limited resources.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Gildernew drew attention to housing
              unfitness and fuel poverty. She highlighted the need for increased
              spending to reduce the level of housing unfitness, to shorten
              waiting lists and to address the problem of fuel poverty. In
              2000-01, the Housing Executive has been provided with additional
              funding of £16 million, of which £2 million will be used to
              combat fuel poverty and a further £3·5 million to provide
              disabled adaptations. As Ms Gildernew pointed out, that does not
              feature in the Supplementary Estimates. This is because, as I
              explained in my opening remarks this morning, some aspects of
              spending, such as the capital spending of the Northern Ireland
              Housing Executive, are outside the vote system. In next year’s
              Budget, the Assembly has approved further additional expenditure
              in those areas in recognition of the importance that the Executive
              and the Assembly attach to the need for affordable investment in
              social housing.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Members raised issues about the
              increases in the costs of departmental administration. Mr Kane
              commented on the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development,
              and similar points were made by Mr Savage. It is important to
              point out that the Department has direct and unavoidable
              responsibilities for providing essential services to the farming
              community.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots and Ms McWilliams made points about
              the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister. It
              is important to point out that some of the new responsibilities,
              which are central to the implementation and operation of the
              agreement, fall to that Department, with particular demands on
              senior staff. It is necessary that such important work be funded.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McHugh spoke about the Department of
              Education. The central administration costs are a relatively small
              proportion of the overall provision.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will try to cover a few further points that
              were raised in the course of debate. Both Mr Leslie and Mr Kennedy
              referred to skills in the Northern Ireland economy. The Department
              of Higher and Further Education, Training and Employment has been
              taking steps to put in place a range of measures to identify
              current and emerging skills shortages and to implement training
              and education programmes to fill them. The programmes are open to
              both the unemployed and those in employment who wish to improve
              their skills and employability.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots spoke about the moratorium on grants
              for hotel development. Following an independent review of hotel
              supply and demand in Northern Ireland, the Tourist Board
              introduced a policy in January 1997, which suspended financial
              support to hotel development projects within a 10-mile radius of
              Belfast city centre. Given that hotel developments have taken
              place without selective financial assistance in the area, it is
              likely that the moratorium will remain in place for the
              foreseeable future.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams spoke about increased
              administration costs for the Department of Higher and Further
              Education, Training and Employment and the Department of Culture,
              Arts and Leisure. The departmental running costs allocation for
              the Department of Higher and Further Education, Training and
              Employment includes an additional £0·9 million to meet the cost
              of the private finance initiative contract with ICL for the
              provision of information technology services.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The increase is necessary because the baseline
              provision for phases one and two did not meet existing needs, and
              those facilities are vital to the proper functioning of the
              Department and its job centre network. The balance of £0·6
              million was required to meet the increased workloads needed to
              support the Minister and to respond to the Assembly’s requests
              for information. Increased expenditure on administration in the
              Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure stems from the need to put
              in place the structures necessary to support the Minister and to
              respond to enquiries from the Assembly. Because it is a new
              Department, expenditure is also required to research and develop
              strategies to meet the needs of its diverse portfolio.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This has been a wide-ranging and interesting
              debate, and I have responded to as many points as possible, while
              trying to ensure that I do not spend too much time on my
              winding-up speech. I thank Members for their valuable
              contributions, not just in this debate but through the Committees,
              correspondence and questions posed here on other occasions. If I
              have not responded to any substantive point, I will be glad to
              reply in writing myself or ask the relevant Minister to do so.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to underline a point that I made at the
              beginning of this winding-up speech. I recognise the frustrations
              of Members if they feel that information important to a debate on
              a motion subject to resolution is not available to them as early
              as they would like.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Estimates bring together, in a procedural
              form, the effects of announcements that have already been made and
              trailed in the Chamber and in the Committees. I note the concerns
              and the interests expressed by individual Members and by people
              speaking on behalf of their Committees. I would not discourage
              people from pursuing those questions in future on the Floor of the
              Chamber or through their Committees.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many of the issues that have been discussed
              give rise to questions about the adequacy of information and
              whether priorities are sufficiently robust or policy principles
              sufficiently transparent to determine how effectively or equitably
              the Departments are allocating money across the region. Those
              questions should not just be saved for plenary debates, but
              neither should they be directed to the Minister of Finance and
              Personnel exclusively. Members and Committees should pursue the
              issues through the means available to them.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly offers Members a great opportunity
              not just to influence allocations but to hold Departments
              accountable for them. For that reason, the Assembly was designed
              to allow the public interest to be reflected in spending plans. It
              is also meant to ensure public accountability with regard to how
              well we manage that expenditure and how we deliver the outcomes
              that we promise as part of those programmes.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Inadequate as our procedures have been to date,
              they will improve. Resource accounting and budgeting will help,
              but I know that all the improvements will not come just from the
              change in the financial management system. I accept that there is
              a need for change in the procedures: information must be available
              to Committees, and the feedback from them must be taken into
              account.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although Committees have had the information
              from monitoring rounds and from the Budget, I am not aware of any
              further requests for information or elaboration on any points that
              have gone unmet, either by my Department or by any other. I hope
              that people will reflect positively on that as they go about their
              business through the other channels available to them as Members
              of the Assembly.</p>

              gnóthas é soláthar uisce agus séarachais, agus go bhfuil
              ardcháilíocht seirbhísí éifeachtacha ag an chuid is mó de na
              daoine.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mar sin féin, is fíorthábhachtach aird a
              tharraingt ar an tearcmhaoiniú dona atá ann le roinnt deicheanna
              de bhlianta anuas agus ar an phráinn atá leis an bhonneagar a
              athnuachan.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I acknowledge that the provision of water and
              sewerage services is a major undertaking. Most people enjoy a
              high-quality and efficient service. However, it is important to
              draw attention to the serious underfunding over several decades
              and the urgent need to renew the infrastructure and improve
              drinking water quality and effluent treatment to comply with EU
              Directives.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appreciate that funding pressures have
              increased with the growth in demand and that even more rigorous
              environmental standards are expected nowadays. The level of
              investment required for water and sewerage services will be
              substantial if we are to maintain and improve existing amenities.
              If we are to ensure proper provision of such essential public
              health services, then the debate at the macro level must focus on
              structural, funding and regulatory arrangements for delivering
              water and sewerage services. We must make sure that services meet
              the challenge.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The real problem in west Tyrone is a human
              rights issue. First, I acknowledge a decision recently made by the
              Minister for Regional Development to move the major waste-water
              treatment works in Omagh from Hunter’s Crescent on the Derry
              Road to an out-of-town site. That campaign was long but
              successful, although there are still concerns about the new
              location. The Minister is listening sympathetically to Omagh
              District Council on the matter. Omagh is, after all, identified as
              a key service and growth centre in the ‘Shaping Our Future’
              documents.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For years, Omagh District Council and I have
              taken an interest in the campaign to ensure that all rural homes
              are connected to a public water supply. I issued a millennium
              challenge to previous Ministers of the Environment — British
              direct-rule Ministers included — on that matter. In west Tyrone,
              there is an unduly large number of homes that are not connected
              either to public water mains or to the sewerage system. We all
              accept that the availability of good quality water and sewerage
              services is an essential requirement in any society and is
              fundamental to the maintenance of public health.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this day and age, it is inconceivable for
              city dwellers to consider that even 2% of homes in the North are
              not connected to public water mains and that 17% are not connected
              to the public sewerage system. Those are merely figures and
              statistics that do not reflect the personal hardship. In fact,
              they mask the real daily hardship for families that lack the
              amenities that the rest of us take for granted. Hot water from a
              tap, fresh water for family use — that is hardly a luxury.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will give some examples of how people are
              affected socially and healthwise. There is a female pensioner in
              Greencastle, County Tyrone, living on a small farm. She has to
              walk to a well every day, which is simply a spout coming out of a
              wall built to protect access for the lady. I showed a photograph
              of that to Reg Empey recently, and he was alarmed that such a
              situation could exist in this day and age. A mother of young
              children at Backglen Road, near Mountfield in County Tyrone,
              regularly travels to Omagh to collect four-gallon drums of water
              for bathing and other everyday uses in her home. The irony of that
              situation is that the family lives three quarters of a mile from a
              reservoir, the main source of tap water for the Omagh area.
              Fortunately, the issue is being addressed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Families in rural Donemana are apprehensive
              about offering a cup of tea to a visitor because of the stigma
              attached to not having clean, hygienic water in their homes.
              People have difficulties with central heating, and others have no
              washing machines. There are various families affected in
              Whitebridge Road in the Sixmilecross area of County Tyrone.
              Examples include farm dwellings and the absence of a fire hydrant
              at a forestry division outpost. People who have plans for
              expanding small engineering businesses in the locality face
              tremendous difficulty.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One elderly man had a water test report carried
              out on his well. An undue presence or level of E.coli was detected
              in the water after the gentleman had spent eight days in intensive
              care in Craigavon Area Hospital. That raises questions about the
              environmental standards of many of the water wells currently in
              use. Dr Wilson, a clinical scientist who carried out tests on the
              water sample taken, revealed it to be unchlorinated water. There
              was an unsatisfactory resolution due to the presence of E.coli.
              The real hardship in that case speaks for itself.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The application procedure is the question. When
              people do not have running water in their homes they apply to the
              Water Service to be connected to a public water main, and the
              financial viability is considered. The Water Service previously
              allowed a maximum of £2,900 for water mains connection.
              Fortunately, that was increased to £5,000 recently for an
              individual unit or home. A home in a rural area was previously
              allowed £2,300 and no more towards sewerage connections. That
              figure was recently raised to £4,000. That was announced in May
              2000. It was welcome because that kind of figure makes a
              difference for some families.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, more work obviously needs to be done
              where the allowable cost limit has not made a difference for
              individual families. Again, referring to one of the examples I
              used earlier — and I am not blaming anyone — it is
              unrealistic, where a proposed scheme is estimated to cost
              £20,900, for the Department, under the new scenario, to allow
              £5,000.</p>

              people benefit. Assembly Members representing rural areas have
              been very vociferous — across all parties — about the deficit
              in services such as the roads infrastructure and proper access to
              hospitals in rural areas. That is another area where people wonder
              why they pay rates and what they get in return.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am asking for greater will on the Department’s
              part. I would like to see an interdepartmental focus on this
              question. Surely the Executive, through the Programme for
              Government, need to address this in an urgent way. What are the
              Executive programme funds for? They should be for areas like this.
              I want to see Minister Gregory Campbell going forward with a bid
              to ensure that all homes are connected to water supplies.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The 2001 census will provide analysis of
              housing stock and population figures. Therefore, if the millennium
              challenge has come and gone — and there has been some response
              in relation to the increased allowable cost limit — let us go
              for a challenge from 2001 to 2011 of eradicating any deficit of
              this nature.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly has to make a difference in such
              areas — along with the Water Service, district councils,
              community groups, the European Union and rural development
              agencies. Let us have a task force aimed at bringing to the
              starting blocks those homes and families in rural areas that do
              not have public water main connections.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The necessary resources need to be made
              available to achieve the standards set by EU Directives. There is
              a real perception that such a situation predominates in areas west
              of the River Bann. People often say to me that they pay tax and
              rates like people living elsewhere.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In departmental or Government terms, the sums
              of money required to redress the huge imbalance are not massive.
              Doing so will dramatically enhance the quality of life for many
              rural families — if the will exists to put it right.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have a copy of the Department of the
              Environment’s Water Service capital works programme for Omagh
              and Strabane districts, which was issued in November 2000. There
              are various categories and states of readiness pertaining to
              hamlets and rural settlement patterns: category one — sewage
              treatment works required to facilitate rural development; category
              one — schemes that are already under construction or are
              scheduled to start; category two — other schemes scheduled to
              begin in the next two years; and category three, which is probably
              the greatest area of concern — schemes that are under
              consideration but may prove to be economically unfeasible.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This concerns townlands and areas such as
              Clanabogan, Newtownsaville, Tattyreagh and Roscavey. Those are
              examples from the Omagh district in particular, where property
              developers have plans to facilitate housing in rural hamlets, but
              are being held to ransom by the absence of adequate sewage
              treatment provision. The Rural Housing Association Ltd also has
              plans to build in some rural areas, but that scheme too is being
              held back by inadequate sewage treatment works.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those are two areas that I deliberately focused
              on: the absence of public water main connection for homes and
              families in rural areas, and the need for joined-up government for
              rural development and the provision of adequate sewage treatment
              works for hamlets. The west Tyrone area plan, which is being
              developed, must take account of the growing need of hamlets in
              west Tyrone. There must be joined-up government.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Any new arrangement or structure for delivering
              water and sewerage services must be capable of securing facilities
              of the highest quality at the lowest possible cost to the consumer
              and of maintaining and improving safeguards for the environment
              and public health.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In local terms, pertaining specifically to west
              Tyrone — but also to other areas where the problem is evident we
              must ensure that 100% of existing homes are connected to a public
              water main supply. Rural development needs must be matched by
              adequate sewerage schemes to serve homes, schools, businesses and
              other properties in settlements such as hamlets. Indeed, the
              concept of hamlets is growing.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is crucial that the development of hamlets
              be enabled and facilitated in line with commitments to rural
              communities made in the Programme for Government and guidelines
              set out elsewhere. Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Byrne:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the case made by Mr McElduff, and I
              thank him for raising the matter. I made a similar case in
              February 1999, also detailing the problems of electricity supply
              in rural areas.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many properties in west Tyrone have never been
              connected to a public water supply. It is difficult for many
              people to comprehend that at the start of the twenty-first century
              there are still people in rural communities who do not enjoy that
              basic public amenity. Purely in terms of new TSN and equality,
              those unfortunate people must not be expected to live much longer
              without the Department for Regional Development connecting them to
              a public water supply.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No matter what the technical, logistical or
              even economic difficulties, those people deserve the provision of
              a public service such as water. It is essential for public health
              and for public service reasons. Parents and children who live in
              isolated communities, especially in the Sperrin Mountains, upper
              land parts of Omagh and Strabane districts, do not enjoy such
              basic amenities.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are also many households throughout west
              Tyrone that do not enjoy connection or access to a public sewerage
              system. The lack of public sewerage facilities is hampering
              development in many parts of the Omagh and Strabane district —
              Clanabogan, Drumnakilly, Gortnagarn, Tattyreagh, Aghyaran,
              Newtownsaville and Roscavey. Indeed, other rural settlements are
              also being hampered.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many rural communities that have been growing
              over the past 10 years are now being prevented from further
              developing due to environmental pollution resulting from a growing
              density of septic tanks. Many small rural schools will only
              survive if we can have housing development provided near them.
              That will only happen if there are, in particular, public sewerage
              connections.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Madam Deputy Speaker [Ms Morrice] in the
              Chair)</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Mr McElduff said, the EU water quality and
              waste water treatment standards require that those public services
              be provided. I pay tribute to the Department for Regional
              Development, for over the past 18 months there have been about 82
              new connections to the public water supply in the Omagh and
              Strabane districts. I pay tribute to the officials who have
              endeavoured to provide a supply, given the economic parameters and
              constraints.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Up until May 2000 the thresholds were £2,900
              for water and £2,300 for sewerage. Since then, those have changed
              to £5,000 for water and £4,000 for sewerage. However, for
              someone living in a house in an isolated area, there can be a
              deficit of £5,000 between, for example, the £15,000 which is
              allowed and the £20,000 that is needed to provide a water supply.
              There needs to be some sort of discretion applied.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask the Department for Regional Development
              to consider the matter so that isolated houses or groups of houses
              could be afforded, in particular, a public water supply. I
              understand that in very isolated areas without a high density of
              population, the septic tank is sufficient to handle the sewage.
              However, if we are serious about new TSN and about equality, then,
              wherever one lives in Northern Ireland, one should be entitled to
              a public water supply.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not going to list the areas without a
              public water supply, but the topography of west Tyrone is such
              that it has a large section of the Sperrin Mountains upper lands.
              There are difficulties in those glens and due consideration needs
              to be given to that. Beyond west Tyrone there are problems in
              parts of north Antrim and in south Down. However, we feel
              particularly aggrieved that in the Omagh and Strabane districts
              there are many households that still do not have such a basic
              amenity. I support the motion, and I hope that some discretion can
              be applied.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, I have been told that the new
              threshold for financial limits applies only to existing properties
              and, therefore, takes no account of new houses that may be built
              on any new stretch of pipeline for water. That is perhaps where
              discretion could be applied and the basic needs of the people met.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gibson:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It seems that every Monday afternoon is west
              Tyrone afternoon. We had a similar discussion last week. I welcome
              all Members to the area of the most profound, undiluted,
              unpolluted raw beauty in the whole Province. We had a problem 10
              years ago when the area plan was launched.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One means devised by planners to keep rural
              people in rural areas and to encourage rural development was to
              create hamlets. That having been accepted as the best way forward,
              it was discovered that prior to direct rule one Department, never
              corresponded with another. When such things as sewerage were
              discussed, I discovered that hamlets were unheard of in what is
              now the Department for Regional Development.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fortunately, since the end of direct rule and
              the appointment of Ministers Peter Robinson and Gregory Campbell
              there has been a change of heart. People in rural areas appreciate
              that. Many isolated people who could not get water under the old
              £2,900 scheme have taken advantage of the new £5,000 scheme —
              already over 80 people have done so. That has been a godsend to
              them. Well done to the Ministers involved, because that was the
              first progress for rural dwellers after 10 years of lobbying.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are 29 hamlets in the Omagh District
              Council area and a similar number in that of Strabane District
              Council. Only the other week Cllr Byrne and I went to Clanabogan.
              After much lobbying, half of that hamlet is getting a sewerage
              system. Topography prevents the other half being done at present.
              The half that is being done now is considered to be more cost
              effective. No recognition was given by one Department because the
              Departments did not correspond. Therefore, there is now a great
              time lag and drawback to development.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Hamlets originate round a church, a school and
              possibly a local shop or post office, and in the past they have
              made do with local septic tanks. However, farmers are coming under
              increasing pressure. The sheughs and burns that serviced their
              farms are now being threatened because the hamlets are expanding
              and septic tanks are pouring into the local water supply. Farmers
              feel threatened, and the developers and builders do not want to
              proceed because they do not want to upset the balance of nature.
              So they await instruction from the Department for Regional
              Development.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am grateful that the matter is being taken
              seriously by the Department. A new sewerage works is different in
              appearance from those of the olden days. It is no longer a crude
              construction of metal work and concrete blocks that existed in
              unsightly forms at the end of villages. Now they can be well
              screened and levelled into the ground so that they are not an
              architectural obscenity. The matter is being taken on board by the
              Departments, and I am glad to see that the technological process
              is beginning to match up.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate the Minister for Regional
              Development on coming to Omagh. After all the requests that Omagh
              people have made, he is the one Minister who has accepted. He has
              been there three or four times already. Every time he has come to
              Omagh he has brought money. Anyone coming to Omagh is welcome if
              they do that. West Tyrone has never had as much development as it
              has had recently. There has been the Leckpatrick scheme, phase two
              of the Strabane bypass, the Newtownstewart bypass, stage three of
              the Omagh bypass and the Garvaghy Road scheme. That amounts to
              £16·5 million.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is in contrast to 30&nbsp;years of bombed
              buildings having to be replaced and of compensation having to be
              paid out. We could have had good roads, sewerage facilities and
              water supplies, but we had to do without, because the money had to
              go elsewhere. I am delighted to see someone aping the &quot;Give
              them all water&quot; challenge that was issued in millennium week
              in the Omagh council chamber. I am delighted and flattered to see
              that. The fact that funding for sewerage schemes has been
              increased from £2,300 to over £4,000 has been most welcome.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ten&nbsp;years ago, the Department of the
              Environment made the decision to help the rural community
              diversify, but now, as part of the Government’s policy of rural
              proofing, of making equality work, of ensuring that equality is
              accessible, there will have to be a further cocktail of funding to
              help the Department supply those areas that are presently beyond
              the scheme.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I received a letter last Thursday from the
              residents of Backglen&nbsp;Road, which is three miles from Omagh.
              The irony was that their land was in the catchment area of the
              local reservoir, yet they were at such an altitude that they
              needed a pump to receive a water supply. They were delighted to
              have fresh water coming into their household for the first time,
              and two young children were able to enjoy bathing and showering in
              their own home instead of going to the local facilities in Omagh
              town. Of the benefits that come from investment, family
              contentment is one of the greatest.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the name of the people who have yet to be
              provided with sewerage facilities, I ask those involved in
              planning to collaborate. The new jargon is &quot;joined-up
              government&quot;, but I call it &quot;corresponding with each
              other in ordinary, friendly terms&quot;. We must get to the stage
              where we do not have a situation where the Planning Service
              decides one thing, and you come along 10 years later trying to
              play catch-up. If collaboration had been taking place then, we
              would not be in this dilemma now. A cocktail of funding should be
              put together so that development in the rural community, which is
              still necessary, can continue, hamlets can be created and schools
              kept open.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If sewerage facilities are not available,
              development cannot happen. If we can get a package together in
              respect of sewage disposal for the hamlets, we will be able to
              solve some problems immediately, and we will also be able to
              sustain rural development. We will be able to keep schools and
              churches open and all the local facilities going, but it is a
              matter of keeping things rural. I am appealing for a cocktail,
              comprising funding from Europe and partnership boards. We must use
              the various sources available and put together a variety of
              packages that will enable rurality to be highly thought of rather
              than having the connotation of deprivation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I say to both Ministers involved: Well done.
              You have been good and kind to west Tyrone, but help us to go
              further by bringing together joined-up government and, above all,
              a package that will sort out the sewage disposal systems in almost
              40&nbsp;hamlets in the area.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I too welcome the chance to contribute. The
              Member who raised the matter is trying to address the question of
              establishing a quality of life equal to that enjoyed by others
              throughout Northern&nbsp;Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue of cross-departmental involvement,
              correspondence — whatever you want to call it — comes to the
              fore. I stress the importance of a clean water supply and good
              sewerage facilities to the health and well-being of people in
              rural areas. We know that care in the community is one of the
              issues coming through in the health proposals, and it is a growing
              area. How can people be sent to their own homes to be cared for in
              the community when they have not got an appropriate water supply
              or sewerage facilities? That is a cross-departmental issue.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is stifling of the regeneration of the
              rural community that the Department of Agriculture and Rural
              Development is trying to encourage. Many of those who live in the
              country and small isolated households are at the older end of the
              age spectrum. It has been rightly pointed out that younger people
              want and expect better facilities. Older folk are prepared to put
              up with it because that is where they have always lived.
              Therefore, those younger people who seek to develop a new home to
              start a new life and who wish to live in the country are prevented
              by the fact that we have not got the sewerage facilities and water
              supply that we want.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Small rural businesses taking part in the rural
              regeneration that we hear about in the Chamber cannot be got up
              and running because the appropriate facilities are not there to
              support them. There seems to be an effort to force our communities
              to move to the towns. The closure of schools and churches in
              certain areas has been mentioned. The community facilities that
              they offer through a church hall, an Orange hall, a GAA club, or
              whatever, need to be aided and supported by the facilities that we
              are imploring the Minister to supply. The business of forcing
              people into towns is a growing issue for the rural community. One
              of the factors forcing them into town is the lack of the
              facilities we are addressing today.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gibson and others have mentioned hamlets in
              rural areas, and I am sure that some Members will recall that the
              proposed crossroads developments — the smaller version of the
              hamlet — were all stifled because of the lack of proper
              facilities to allow the planners to say &quot;Yes, we will allow
              that to go ahead.&quot;</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has all been said. The areas have been
              identified. I am surprised that Mr McElduff did not identify the
              area of Aghyaran as one of the major outlying areas in west Tyrone
              and the Strabane District Council area. I support the general
              thrust of the motion. I trust that we will gain support in the
              Assembly today and that the Minister can give us some hope that,
              perhaps with a tweaking of the criteria and funds coming in from
              other Departments, he will be able to give us in the rural
              community the facilities that I know he wants to provide.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister for Regional Development (Mr
              Campbell):</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Department’s Water Service has maintained
              a high level of capital investment on upgrading water and sewerage
              facilities in the Omagh District Council and Strabane District
              Council areas in recent times. However, continued investment
              remains necessary over a much longer period to achieve the higher
              level of modern service properly expected by all customers.
              Subject to funding, my Department has planned a very significant
              construction programme in the west Tyrone area.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to deal specifically with that matter
              before responding to the comments that were made during the
              debate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the five-year period up to 2000, a total
              investment of £18&nbsp;million was targeted at five major water
              supply projects and 10&nbsp;sewerage projects across the area.
              That included the upgrading of the water treatment works at
              Castlederg, which is ongoing at a cost of £10&nbsp;million. This
              year, construction work has started on a £6 million programme,
              which is largely targeted at improving drinking-water quality.
              Improvements to the Lough Braden/Lough Macrory water supply system
              will continue with the £4 million upgrading of the Lough Braden
              treatment works.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Planned expenditure over the next
              five&nbsp;years includes £9&nbsp;million for four water supply
              projects to ensure an adequate supply of high-quality water. This
              will comprise the upgrading of the Lough Macrory water treatment
              works and the provision of a new river intake to the Derg water
              treatment works to cater for increasing demand. Over the same
              five-year period, £22&nbsp;million is to be spent on waste-water
              treatment facilities to ensure compliance with modern regulatory
              and European Directive standards. The work will also serve to
              protect the environment, including the river systems of the area.
              The construction of new waste-water treatment works is planned for
              Omagh and Strabane, subject to the resolution of all the relevant
              practical details, including planning approval and land
              acquisition. Between 2005 and 2010, an investment of
              £14&nbsp;million is to be made on water main improvements across
              the region. A programme of studies has commenced to quantify
              detailed requirements.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will now discuss the reasonable cost
              allowance referred to by a number of Members. Despite the
              investment I outlined, I am acutely aware that a small number of
              properties do not have access to mains water supplies. Generally,
              they are located in remote or isolated areas, and mains water
              connections have previously proved to be impossible on cost and
              technical grounds. In May&nbsp;2000, the reasonable cost allowance
              used to determine connection to a water mains was almost doubled
              to £5,000 for existing properties. I should stress that the
              previous scheme was in place for more than 15&nbsp;years. We
              estimate that the increase will enable approximately one third of
              unconnected properties in Northern Ireland — or some 1,800
              properties — to have access to mains supplies for the first
              time.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since the increase was announced,
              12&nbsp;properties in the Omagh District Council area, which were
              previously considered to be uneconomic, have been connected to the
              main supplies. Mr&nbsp;Byrne said that 82 property owners have
              taken advantage of the scheme in the past two&nbsp;years.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A further five water main extension schemes are
              at the design or construction stage. Those schemes, which involve
              the laying of some 3,300&nbsp;metres of new water mains, will
              enable a further 13 existing properties to be connected.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Water Service has identified 39 properties
              in the Omagh District Council area that cannot be connected to
              mains supplies, despite the increase in the reasonable cost
              allowance. The remote location of those properties also precludes
              connection on technical grounds, since it is not possible to keep
              water disinfected as it travels through long mains. However, I
              strongly believe that all households should be able to enjoy
              access to quality water supplies, so I have instructed my
              officials to consider providing financial assistance to
              householders to improve the quality of their private supplies. The
              Water Service has undertaken a study of unconnected properties in
              its western division, which will inform the scope of any such
              grant scheme.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.30 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As regards planning approval for hamlet
              developments, the Water Service is routinely consulted during the
              consideration of any planning application on the subject of the
              feasibility of providing water and sewerage services to new
              developments. However, planning policy with regard to hamlet
              developments is a matter for the Department of the Environment.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, I must refer to the revised
              charging guidelines. The announcement that I referred to regarding
              the increase in the reasonable cost allowance for existing
              properties in May 2000 also referred to a review of the charging
              guidelines for the provision of infrastructure to new
              developments. The review has now been concluded, and my officials
              will shortly undertake a consultation exercise on the draft
              proposals arising from the review. They will also take account of
              equality perspectives as they undertake the task.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I view with all seriousness the fact that some
              people have not got access to a mains water supply. I will
              endeavour, insofar as it is practicable and possible, to ensure
              that the quality of water that is supplied to those homes improves
              over the coming years. I hope that the review that I have just
              outlined regarding new developments will be announced in the near
              future. Obviously, I will undertake to study closely any proposals
              that I get in relation to the consultation exercise that follows
              that announcement.</p>
