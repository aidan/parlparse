			<td><p class="H1DocumentHeading">THE ASSEMBLY</p>
				<p class="H2DocumentDate">Monday 15 May 2006</p>
				<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The Assembly met at 10.30 am (Madam Speaker in the  Chair).</p>
				<p class="H3SectionHeading">Assembly Business</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  Members, please take your seats.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">In accordance with the Northern Ireland Act 2006, the  Secretary of State has directed that the Assembly should sit on Monday 15 May  2006 at 10.30 am to consider business as it appears in the Order Paper.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">Before we proceed, I wish to read into the record some  letters of appointment.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">First, in a letter to me dated 9 May 2006, the Secretary of  State said:</p>
				<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;By virtue of my powers under Paragraph 3(1)(a) of  Schedule 1 to the Northern Ireland Act 2006, I hereby appoint you as Presiding  Officer of the Assembly. Your appointment shall take effect from today&rsquo;s date.&rdquo;</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, in a letter dated 11 May 2006, the Secretary of  State said the following:</p>
				<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;I am writing to formally notify you that I have today  appointed Jim Wells MLA of the Democratic Unionist Party and Francie Molloy MLA  of Sinn Fein as Deputy Presiding Officers of the Assembly and have placed a  Written Ministerial Statement before Parliament to this effect.&rdquo;</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">I offer my congratulations to my two colleagues and look  forward to working with them both.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">Finally, Members, in a letter of intent to me dated 12 May  2006, the Secretary of State said the following:</p>
				<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;You will have received my letter of 11 May setting  out the matters which I am referring for the first week of Assembly business.</p>
				<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">I know from our discussions that you are fully aware  of the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead and I have every hope that  you will be able to oversee the rapid transition of the Assembly to full  devolution. There will, of course, be obstacles to overcome and they must be  overcome if MLAs are not to stand accused of perpetuating the democratic  deficit which Northern Ireland has seen in recent years. But, given the bitter  history of Northern Ireland, it is important that we recognise and understand  the difficulties for all sides in what the Assembly is now being asked to do.  No-one underestimates the challenges ahead and the divisions which remain.</p>
				<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">If we are to heal those divisions then this must be a  time to focus on what unites us. All the political parties, the British and  Irish Governments and, most importantly, the people of Northern Ireland, are  united in their belief that devolution and power-sharing are the only way to  establish an enduring, stable future. That is why the Assembly has been  recalled with the express purpose of electing a First and Deputy First Minister  and forming an Executive, with the opportunity to consider issues of vital  importance for their constituents. Now is the time for Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  politicians to shoulder this responsibility for their people&rsquo;s future, as they  have been elected to do; it is time to open a new chapter of stability, opportunity  and restored devolution in Northern Ireland.</p>
				<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">As I have said before, the decisions which will have  to be taken are not easy ones, but history has presented us all with a decisive  opportunity to move forward in the coming weeks. The tragic events of recent  days have once again shown how desperately the people of Northern Ireland need  a new vision for a truly shared society. I know that the promise of a better  future for the young people of Northern Ireland will be uppermost in the minds  of all MLAs as they approach the days ahead in a spirit of partnership and  generosity.&rdquo;</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">I have placed copies of these letters in the Assembly  Library.</p>
				<p class="H3SectionHeading">Silent Reflection</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  Members will have noted that, as is the custom at the first sitting, we do not  have Prayers on our Order Paper. I am, however, conscious, as we meet this  morning, of the tragic death, on Monday last, of Michael McIlveen.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">In recent days, I have heard expressions of sympathy made  publicly and privately by Members on all sides of the House. With that in mind,  I ask Members to stand and join me in observing one minute&rsquo;s silent reflection.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed one minute&rsquo;s silence.</p>
				<p class="H3SectionHeading">Assembly Business</p>
				<p class="H4StageHeading">Roll of Membership</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  The next item of business on the Order Paper is the Roll of Membership. As  required by Standing Order 3(a), a Member shall be regarded as having taken his  or her seat only when he or she has signed the Roll of Membership. I do not  therefore propose to take any points of order until after the Roll has been  signed by all Members present.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">I shall now explain the procedures that will be followed  for the signing of the Roll. These have been discussed and agreed at meetings  of the Business Committee.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">In order to avoid the Chair being vacated, I will sign the  Roll at the Speaker&rsquo;s Table, after which the Roll will be placed on the table  in front of me. I shall then invite Members of the Assembly to come forward in  their party groupings to sign the Roll. I will call the parties in alphabetical  order by name of the party. Independent Members will be called in alphabetical  order at the end.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">When your party name is called, I ask Members of that party  to rise in their places and proceed through the Aye Lobby on my right. Members  should then come forward to sign one of the two Roll pages placed on the table  in front of the Speaker&rsquo;s Table.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">Members should enter today&rsquo;s date, print and sign their  name, and may enter a designation of identity. I draw Members&rsquo; attention to the  provisions of Standing Order 3(e), regarding the designation of &ldquo;Nationalist,  Unionist or Other&rdquo;. A Member who does not register a designation of identity  will be deemed to be designated &ldquo;Other&rdquo; for the purposes of the Standing  Orders.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">The process of signing the Roll will take some time, and I  ask Members for their patience during this procedure.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">Clerk, if I may now sign the Roll.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Madam Speaker signed the Roll of Membership as  follows:</p>
				<p class="RollofMembersList">Bell,  Eileen&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  Members of the Assembly, I should like to make a brief personal statement  before others sign the Roll.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">I consider it a great privilege to have been appointed to  hold the office of Speaker of this Assembly. In any elected body, the office of  Speaker draws much of its authority and dignity from the respect and  co-operation of the Members, particularly in their relationship with the Chair.  I hope that I can rely on your support as I try to uphold the values of the  tradition. For my part, I will do my utmost to maintain your respect for the  office of Speaker, and I trust that I can count on your co-operation.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">Like each of you, I have been elected to serve my  constituents and, in whatever role I can play in this place, to work for the  best interests of all the people of Northern Ireland. I regard that as a  greater privilege, and I commit myself to assisting you to perform that task on  behalf of your own constituents and the wider community.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">This Assembly has been established to make preparations for  the restoration of devolved Government in Northern Ireland and a fully restored  Assembly. How we conduct ourselves in this Chamber, and particularly in regard  to each other, will contribute to our electorate&rsquo;s view of our entitlement to  hold office in that Assembly. That stands as both a challenge and a standard  against which each one of us will be measured.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">For my part, I want simply to state to you that I stand  before you as a servant of the Assembly. I intend to follow the established  precedent of not making political comment to the media; I intend to stand aside  from party politics and to offer myself as a spokes&shy;person for the Assembly,  its collective will and particularly its secretariat, which has served us all  so well.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">I look forward to whatever time I will have in this  position. I am indebted to you for your patience as I strive to serve you all.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">We shall now proceed.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">I invite Members of the Alliance Party to come forward to  sign the Roll of Membership.</p>

				<p class="RollofMembersList">McCartney,  Robert Unionist</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  I invite the Independent Unionist Member, Mr Paul Berry, to come forward to  sign the Roll of Membership.</p>

				<p class="RollofMembersList">Berry, Paul&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unionist</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  I invite the Independent Member, Dr Kieran Deeny, to come forward to sign the  Roll of Membership.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The following Member signed the Roll of Membership:</p>
				<p class="RollofMembersList">Deeny,  Kieran&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  Finally, I invite any Member present who has not already done so to come  forward to sign the Roll of Membership.</p>
				<p class="TimePeriod">11.30 am</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">I thank Members for their co-operation and patience during  the signing of the Roll of Membership. The Roll will be located in the Chamber  during sitting days to enable any Member who has not been able to sign the Roll  to do so.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">Standing Order 3(a) states that my decision as to whether a  Member has taken his or her seat in accordance with the Standing Order is  final. I can make that decision only after scrutinising all of the entries on  the Roll. I intend to make an announcement on this matter at the start of the  next meeting of the Assembly.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  On a point of order, Madam Speaker. One of the other duties that you and your  staff are expected to perform today is to publish a list of Members of each of  the parties. Standing Orders are clear on the matter and refer to the:</p>
				<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;list of seats in the Assembly held by members of each  party&rdquo;.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">They do not refer to a group or to those who are taking the  whip of a particular party but to members of the party itself.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyText">There are public indications that the Ulster Unionist Party  intends that a Member for East Belfast, Mr Ervine, be a member of its group.  Will you clarify the situation, either now or after you have taken counsel&rsquo;s  opinion? There are political implications &mdash; perhaps long into the future &mdash; with  this matter and as to whether it falls within the interpretation of the  Standing Order that deals with being a member of a party. I understand from the  constitution rules of the Ulster Unionist Party that, in order to be a member  of that political party, a person cannot be a member of any other political  party.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  I thank Mr Robinson for his point of order. It is a serious matter and has to  be looked at very carefully. I will be taking counsel and I will, hopefully, be  making a ruling at tomorrow&rsquo;s sitting.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Ian  Paisley</strong>: Further to that point of order, Madam Speaker. Will you explain  why you took the decision today to allow another Member to be incorporated  under the Official Unionist banner?</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  I was provided with the information about party membership in accordance with  Standing Order 3, and that information has been set out accurately in the  published list.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Ian  Paisley</strong>: Further to that point of order, Madam Speaker. The list that we  received showed:</p>
				<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Progressive Unionist Party</p>
				<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">Members (1):</p>
				<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">Mr David Ervine&rdquo;.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  That list was from Thursday. An updated list was issued after we received the  list from the Ulster Unionist Party Assembly Group. That list should now be in  your possession.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Ian  Paisley</strong>: We never saw that list.</p>
				<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  It was circulated this morning before 9.30 am, which is in line with  convention. However, as I said to your colleague, it is a serious matter that  will be looked at.</p>
				<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Adjourned at 11.34 am.</p>
