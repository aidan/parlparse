                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. I want to
                move to the &quot;foot-in-mouth&quot; disease. On Saturday the
                ‘News Letter’ ran what amounted to a detailed confession by
                one of Mr&nbsp;Trimble’s closest and strongest supporters. It
                stated that the First Minister and the leadership of the Ulster
                Unionist Party had been consistently dishonest; misled or lied
                to people; duped the electorate; and had been inaccurate in
                their interpretation of the Belfast Agreement — among other
                accusations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The normal procedure in most other
                legislative chambers is that people would be entitled to some
                form of emergency debate on a matter which, quite clearly, goes
                to the very heart of the way such institutions were set up and
                the way they are running. Can you advise us, Mr Speaker, if
                there is any way we could have this debate today or tomorrow?
                The issues are so important that I do not think they can be
                passed off or left to be put down in a motion for next week.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Standing Orders we have here are, in
                certain ways, somewhat different from the standing orders in
                other places. I have looked at this in the past, but I will
                certainly examine it again to see whether the Member’s request
                can be accommodated. However, so far as I am aware, it is not
                something that can be accommodated under our current Standing
                Orders, even in the context of leave, though I will need to
                check that, as any motion would not be on the Order Paper, and
                there are certain requirements regarding Standing Orders. I will
                check the matter and get back to the Member. At this moment I am
                not aware of any mechanism of the kind he describes.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am grateful for that ruling, Mr Speaker. If
                a motion of no confidence were to be put down today would that
                attract a more expeditious procedure?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not know that a motion of no confidence
                would be different from any other motion. However, I will check
                the matter and get back to the Member.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Tierney:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. Have you not
                ruled on newspaper reports in the past? I think you said a
                couple of times that you would not allow any discussion on
                newspaper reports. I believe that that is what has been quoted
                today.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Newspaper reports are of themselves not a
                subject for debate, but, as I understand it, the Member is
                saying that the substance of the newspaper report is such as to
                stimulate cause for concern. I hesitate to take the view that
                nothing that appears in newspapers would be a proper subject for
                debate here. There may be some such things. I do not think I can
                rule out of order the concern that the Member raises. However,
                this is a wholly political concern, and not for me to judge
                upon.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a further point of order, Mr Speaker. Is
                there not a distinction between a newspaper report, the validity
                of which can be questioned, and a actual article, in the first
                person, from a supporter of Mr Trimble who is accusing him of
                being dishonest and lying to the people of Northern Ireland?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Newspaper reports may or may not be true. In
                my experience, the claims of individuals, whether in the first
                person or in another person —</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He is a supporter.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">— may or may not necessarily be true.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member says that the person is a
                supporter. He will be familiar with the old adage that opponents
                are people in other parties, whereas enemies are those in one’s
                own. I do not think that I can make any assumptions of that
                kind. I can only deal with the technical question, and I will
                return to that matter and clarify it.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a further point of order, Mr Speaker. Is
                it right that you should be casting such aspersions on those
                sitting behind Mr Trimble? The person who wrote this article in
                the ‘News Letter’ is a paid employee of the party in
                question, and for him to make these allegations against Mr
                Trimble is astounding.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not necessary to question the integrity
                or the standing or the views of sitting Members. We were only,
                as I understand it, referring to members of parties, and that is
                a separate matter from Members of the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The technical question has been sufficiently
                aired.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fourth meeting of the North/ South
                Ministerial Council in its trade and business development
                sectoral format took place in Dundalk on Friday 16 February
                2001. Following nomination by the First Minister and the Deputy
                First Minister, Dr Seán Farren and I represented the Executive.
                The Irish Government was represented by Ms Mary Harney TD,
                Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. This report has
                been approved by Dr Farren and is also made on his behalf.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council received a verbal progress report
                from the chief executive of the Trade and Business Development
                Body, Mr Liam Nellis. This included briefing Ministers on the
                establishment of its offices in Newry and the appointment of its
                permanent staff. The Council noted a paper introduced by Mr
                Nellis, which outlined the main activities carried out by the
                body in its first year of operation. Ministers welcomed the
                considerable progress made in establishing the body and the
                volume of work which had been completed by its board.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ministers approved the body’s operating
                plan for 2001, which outlined activities for the year and the
                associated budget. Major initiatives planned for
                InterTradeIreland for 2001 include: promoting increased use of
                equity/venture capital throughout the island; supporting science
                and technological innovation in companies on a cross-border
                basis; supporting the development of e-commerce throughout the
                island, including the establishment of an all-island research
                fund; assisting in the strengthening of the local supply chain
                to both major multinational and indigenous companies on the
                island of Ireland; and promoting the benefits of North/South
                trade and enhancing market awareness.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the legislation establishing the body,
                InterTradeIreland was mandated to bring forward to the council
                proposals for establishing graduate and other placement
                programmes on a North/South basis. The Ministers approved the
                body’s proposals to introduce two programmes on a cross-border
                basis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The small and medium-sized enterprise (SME)
                business development programme is aimed at giving SMEs access to
                a wider reservoir of knowledge and expertise through working
                with a graduate/diploma holder to transfer technology and
                know-how. The cross-border trade programme is aimed at
                developing cross-border trade and providing back-up support to
                SMEs by matching a business from one side of the border with a
                graduate from the other. Ministers asked that this activity be
                treated as a key priority that could make an important impact on
                developing and increasing trade and business links North and
                South.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the North/South Ministerial Council
                meeting the Ministers noted and approved the proposals put
                forward by InterTradeIreland to enhance competitiveness. It was
                agreed that the proposals should be taken forward in
                co-operation with Departments with a view to an interim report’s
                being presented to the plenary meeting in March 2001. In this
                regard, InterTradeIreland brought forward a number of specific
                recommendations in respect of areas such as innovation and
                information and communication technology in which the body
                considered it could address all-island competitiveness issues.
                The Ministers considered and agreed that the body’s draft
                equality scheme should be published.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council agreed that its next meeting in
                this sectoral format would take place in Northern Ireland in
                June 2001.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What progress has been made by the trade body
                to liberalise public procurement so that firms based on one side
                of the Irish border can bid fairly for Government contracts
                emerging from the jurisdiction on the other?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member has correctly addressed an issue
                that has been of some considerable concern. As one knows, public
                procurement is a substantial budgetary element here, in the
                Republic and throughout the European Union. The Member will be
                familiar with public procurement policies throughout the
                European Union and with the fact that the whole objective of
                creating a free market was to give people opportunities to
                compete and win contracts throughout the European Union.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member will be aware that we have a
                particular difficulty with the currency differential. That
                militates against those of us who are trying to bid into the
                euro zone, although there has been some slight improvement
                there. The body is acutely aware of the necessity to encourage
                this aspect, and the matter has been brought to the attention of
                business people at its roadshows — four of which have taken
                place in the last few months. It is also trying to notify and
                identify companies that could bid for public work. We believe
                that this awareness procedure will be successful, and the
                programme will continue throughout the next 12 months.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for his statement given
                on behalf of himself and my Colleague Dr Seán Farren. I commend
                the Minister for his work, outlined in the report, on the
                North/South Ministerial Council. Is the Minister aware that many
                firms in the Republic of Ireland, particularly in the Greater
                Dublin area, are very interested in setting up satellite
                operations in the North of Ireland based primarily on the new
                technologies, but also in many other skills areas? Does he
                intend to make any special arrangements or provisions by way of
                organisational help or financial incentives? That would bring
                many of these anticipated developments to a practical
                conclusion. If I may be parochial, the Minister could also
                indicate that the best place to locate would be the constituency
                of South Down. However, generally speaking, anywhere in Northern
                Ireland would suffice.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I assume that that was not an invitation to
                act against one constituency in favour of another. I assure the
                hon Member that the IDB is acutely aware of the potential
                benefits of attracting investment from the Republic. There have
                been two significant investments in the last two months — one
                by the Bank of Ireland, which has come to Newry in recent weeks.
                The IDB has reorganised its team and appointed several people to
                look at that particular market to see what is available. The
                early signs are encouraging.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the last four months we have had three
                major investments. I believe that others will be secured, for we
                consider ourselves to have significant advantages over the
                Greater Dublin area in particular. These include lower rates of
                staff turnover and a significant supply of qualified labour in
                certain disciplines. This will be one of our key target areas
                for attracting inward investment, and I assure the Member that
                the IDB is fully engaged in this process.</p>

                focused on promoting the benefits of North/South trade and
                enhancing market awareness. The Minister mentioned areas in

                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;the Body considered it could address
                all-island competitiveness issues, for example in areas such as
                innovation and information and communication technology.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those of us who travel throughout the island
                will notice that when using mobile phones to make calls either
                North to South or South to North — even if only two miles up
                the road — we can be charged at international rates. When in
                the North, you may find that you are on the Eircell system, and
                occasionally when you are in the South you are still on the
                Vodafone network. Could the body take up the issue of creating
                an island market and cut out the high tariffs associated with
                international calls, given that many of these companies are
                buying each other out and amalgamating?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The points the Member makes about mobile
                phones make it obvious that he is not a shareholder in Orange.
                We have all noticed them, and we all complain bitterly about the
                call charges. However, telecoms issues are a reserved matter. We
                do, however, point out to Whitehall a number of the issues that
                we believe to be significant. For instance, in the Programme for
                Government our objective is to roll out broadband issues to
                ensure that, from the point of view of targeting social need,
                all areas of the Province have the opportunity to access proper
                services at a competitive rate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are huge issues here, and this one is
                international in the broadest sense of the word. The European
                Union is looking very closely at telecoms provision and how the
                market can be open to competition. This Assembly does not have
                the power to determine. However, any issues which relate to
                competitiveness — and they do not all fall within devolution
                — are the subject of an ongoing study. A report is due to be
                published in September or October 2001, and issues which are a
                barrier to competitiveness will be identified, whether or not
                they are in our own remit. I hope that when the final report is
                presented we will be able to take matters up in this House.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister accept that Northern
                Ireland is still in competition with the Irish Republic for
                inward investment? What steps has he taken to ensure that
                information which may be of use to our competitors in the Irish
                Republic does not leak from the trade and business development
                body or the North/South Ministerial Council? For example, if
                information on an inward investment proposal for Northern
                Ireland were tabled at a meeting of one of these bodies, our
                competitors in the South might say &quot;We quite fancy having
                that inward investment in the Irish Republic&quot; and use the
                information to their advantage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What steps has the Minister taken to settle
                the redundancy package for the staff of the new body, given that
                after the May election they will all be out on their ear?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member obviously does not appreciate that
                the North/South trade and business development body is not an
                inward investment body. It therefore does not have that
                information and consequently will not deal with that matter.
                That is the function of the Industrial Development Board for
                Northern Ireland or the Industrial Development Agency in the
                Republic. The North/South trade and business development body
                deals with trade and the promotion of a wide variety of issues,
                but inward investment is not one of its functions.</p>

                Overall, I accept and welcome the improved employment figures.
                However, does the Minister agree that comparative figures along
                the border counties remain a major concern? They are
                particularly aggravated by infrastructural deficit, to which the
                Minister has referred — broadband technology and its
                expansion, and so on. Are benefits perhaps emerging at the
                North/South cores and missing the respective peripherals? Has
                the issue of comparative higher unemployment along the border
                counties been addressed at the North/ South Ministerial Council?
                If not, will it be addressed?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am aware of the Member’s points, but the
                North/South Ministerial Council is a focus body. It does not
                deal with a broad range of social and economic issues. Even
                within its remit, it can deal with only certain parts of that
                remit at a time. The Programme for Government recognises the
                difficulties in several areas, including the Member’s
                constituency, and is attempting to address them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also conscious that in the Irish
                Republic there are many people who regard the Celtic tiger
                economy as, perhaps, having run out of steam by the time it gets
                to the north-west of Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has been put to me on a number of
                occasions that that is the case. The matters the hon Member
                mentioned are currently not designated to this body for
                attention. The remit of the Trade and Business Development Body
                is primarily to increase trade and awareness. We are trying to
                promote recognition of companies which are close to each other
                but which currently do not conduct any business. I am sure the
                Member will agree with me that it is entirely advantageous to
                our economy to ensure that situation does not exist.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to employment differentials,
                peripheral matters, and the issues surrounding
                telecommunications and broadband technology, there is a specific
                commitment in the Programme for Government to ensure that no
                area is disadvantaged. That may mean that significant decisions
                will have to be made. I have asked for a meeting with the
                Whitehall Small Business and e-Commerce Minister, Ms Patricia
                Hewitt. I hope to see her soon to ensure that there is a
                coherent approach throughout the United Kingdom to these
                matters. That will be of direct benefit to the Member’s
                constituency.</p>

                the Minister to bring to the attention of the North/South
                Ministerial Council and the InterTradeIreland body the fact that
                we need to see strong evidence of a meaningful graduate exchange
                programme. In particular, those graduates who are interested in
                the information technology sector should be encouraged and
                helped by venture capital, which is vital allowing these young
                graduates, who have good ideas, to develop small businesses.
                This would bring great benefit to an area such as my own in
                Omagh.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the Member’s points, and, as he
                will have heard in the statement, we received a report with
                regard to the graduate placement programme. To put this into
                context, it is a not dissimilar scheme to the one run by my
                Department, on a worldwide basis, called the Explorers 2000
                Programme. What this particular programme focuses on is matching
                companies on each side of the border with potential graduates or
                diploma holders. The small businesses that we are aiming at are
                those which currently may not have the resources to employ
                people with particular skills, whether in accountancy, in
                marketing or in communications technology skills. Those people
                will be supported with assistance from the body, and the company
                would be making a contribution. We are currently trying to match
                those people so that the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)
                will receive a capability that they do not currently have. That
                is consistent with the objective of improving business and with
                the Explorers 2000 Programme, which operates on an international
                basis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the council meeting on 16&nbsp;February we
                decided to step up the work being done in this field, and we
                also decided that we needed to be aggressive and to put the
                resources into this area to ensure that the work is successful.
                We will be looking closely in the next few months to see, as the
                programme rolls out, how successful it is. If it is successful
                we will be prepared to redirect resources, within the existing
                budget, to support the programme. I believe that it has enormous
                potential.</p>

                strengthening of the local supply chain to both major
                multinational and indigenous companies on the island of Ireland.
                Can the Minister give more details about that to the House? Will
                he also detail in relation to both indigenous companies and
                multinationals the current level of co-operation between the
                Industrial Development Authority (IDA) and the IDB, and
                Enterprise Ireland and LEDU? Go raibh maith agat.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the first point, the hon
                Member will be aware that in order to achieve the full potential
                of these institutions, a whole range of people have to take
                action, including those in the hon Member’s own party.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to supply chains and the level of
                co-operation between companies, InterTradeIreland has already
                held four roadshows, which were designed to raise awareness
                throughout Northern Ireland and the Republic. It is recognised
                that the level of trade between the Republic and Northern
                Ireland is not that which could be anticipated for two
                jurisdictions sharing a common border, and another interesting
                point is that it is proving extremely difficult to get an
                accurate measurement of what the level of trade is. Work is
                currently being undertaken to confirm this, as there is quite a
                significant discrepancy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mention was made of multinational companies.
                Many of them are now in control of vast areas of trade, whether
                in food products or otherwise. The intention of the trade and
                business development body is to identify areas where there is
                potential to bring together people whom we believe can actually
                do business. It aims to introduce companies to one another and
                to hold networking sessions so that there is an opportunity for
                suppliers and customers to meet and to try to encourage them to
                do business. The comparatively low level of co-operation has
                struck the organisation since it has been operating. As a direct
                result, the IDB and IDA held their first meeting in May last
                year in the north-west. Flowing from that, they are trying to
                agree how they can jointly promote the area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As was hinted at in a previous question, we
                are indeed competitors for inward investment. Although promoting
                inward investment is not a function of this organisation, the
                point is taken.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The objective of improving the supply chains
                is very simple: to bring together companies that could trade
                with each other but currently do not, and to suggest to
                companies that do not even attempt to export to or from the
                Republic that they can. I have seen this work quite well at
                supplier events, even at local authority level.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The IDA and IDB have met once. They have
                undertaken a programme of work. I know that there is

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Beggs:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to return to the issue of
                all-island competitiveness, especially in the area of public
                procurement in the Republic of Ireland. Before coming to the
                Assembly, I worked as a production manager. That involved
                tendering for work in Northern Ireland, England, Scotland and
                the Republic of Ireland for a company which had ISO 9002 and
                used internationally recognised products. Despite that,
                expensive tests were required to be duplicated for inclusion in
                tenders for public procurement in the Republic of Ireland. Can
                the Minister give an assurance that he and InterTradeIreland
                will consult with local industry and trade groups to ensure that
                the public procurement procedures in the Republic of Ireland
                allow free and unhindered access to Northern Ireland companies?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can assure the Member that that certainly
                is the objective. The question of testing was one of the issues
                given to this body in its initial remit. The situation having
                been examined, it was decided that InterTradeIreland, pursuing
                the matter itself, would bring no added value. However, the
                testing authorities in the Republic of Ireland and the United
                Kingdom as a whole have been brought together — as that is how
                most of this is organised. Those organisations are currently
                meeting and working together. InterTradeIreland has moved back
                from that, allowing those organisations to take matters forward
                and come up with their own solutions. That is being actively
                pursued, but it was felt that this body was not the right
                vehicle to take the matter forward. The authorities have now met
                and are working on a paper to improve their procedures. There is
                no doubt that the type of matters referred to by the Member are
                fundamentally anti- competitive. One of the measurements of the
                success of the body will be whether such barriers to trade are
                removed.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McMenamin:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Representing the border constituency of West
                Tyrone, I welcome the Minister’s announcement. Does he agree
                that a priority of the new body should be to ensure that there
                is an effective exchange of information between businesses and
                support agencies in both parts of Ireland? If so, how will
                InterTradeIreland address the issue?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes, undoubtedly. The effective exchange of
                information and the raising of awareness, which flows from that,
                are vital. The body will be hosting its own web site, and public
                or private bodies which wish to put information on the site will
                be able to do so. That, of course, will be entirely their
                decision. Nevertheless, a focal point will exist, where people
                who want to do trade and make contacts will have a specific site
                to visit. They will be able to exchange ideas and views there.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, the body has set aside a budget
                for identifying where it can hold localised meetings in both
                jurisdictions to bring people together to achieve exactly the
                same thing. As I mentioned earlier, the comparatively low level
                of meeting, co-operation and information flowing in this area
                has surprised the body itself — the directors and staff —
                and all of us. I am sure that the Member will agree that
                anything to improve that information flow is bound to be
                beneficial.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister referred to the supply chain to
                major multinational and indigenous companies in Ireland. We are
                all very aware, especially here in the Province, of the
                producer, processor, retailer and, ultimately, the consumer
                supply chain. How will this be promoted and encouraged, and will
                targets be set to achieve the goal?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, in relation to North/South trade
                and enhancing market awareness, can the Minister indicate if
                there has been an increase in trade between Northern Ireland and
                the Republic? Who is responsible for promoting Northern Ireland
                industry and its market awareness in that, and how will its
                success be measured?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At present, no specific targets have been set
                with regard to the supply chains, but it has been agreed that
                this clearly must be one of the top priorities. Indeed, that was
                set out in the statement that accompanied the meeting. I am sure
                that the Member will have experienced a situation at local
                council level where people from the district are invited to meet
                the council to see whether business can be done between the
                council and those who might supply it. It is a simple, tried and
                tested method, but it is one that has not yet been done in this
                context. InterTradeIreland is going to set about developing
                those supply chains by bringing together people who could do
                business with each other. I referred to the value of trade
                between Northern Ireland and the Republic in relation to an
                earlier question. There is considerable doubt as to what the
                actual level of that trade is.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Statistics are managed on two different bases
                in the North and in the South. In the United Kingdom, Customs
                and Excise has its own measuring system, which covers only
                companies with a turnover of over £250,000. Figures in the
                Irish Republic are measured by different criteria, so there is
                some doubt about the true level of trade. The only way to
                benchmark whether a body is achieving anything is to see if
                there is a significant increase, so it is important to have a
                baseline benchmark at the outset. It is vital to have some such
                mechanism, because many of the companies are small and many are
                in the agriculture sector, which we intend to encourage. Much of
                the trade is not in goods but in service provision, so there is
                no physical movement of goods over the border, but there could
                be telephonic communication. Whitehall and its counterparts in
                the Republic are actively working on this.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The significant differences between each
                jurisdiction’s trade estimates have only recently come to
                light. The Department also carries out its own client testing,
                so there is back-up. As the Member rightly points out, much work
                remains to be done, because this is the only way in which we can
                measure success or failure. I assure him that this is a matter
                of urgency and that we hope to have it resolved by September.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Molloy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat. I welcome the Minister’s
                statement and his positive attitude. May I draw his attention to
                the setting up of the body’s office in Newry and the promotion
                of e-commerce? The Minister referred to the Bank of Ireland
                project which is locating in Newry. Can he give the House an
                assurance that the Newry office will ensure that business is
                distributed throughout the North and is not just focused in the
                Newry area? I mention this because the Bank of Ireland had been
                looking at my council area of Dungannon before the IDB’s
                involvement. When the IDB and, possibly, this body became
                involved, the project was relocated to Newry. Was any
                ministerial influence brought to bear on the location of the
                Bank of Ireland’s project in Newry?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is a matter for the IDB and not for this
                body. It is the IDB’s responsibility to attract inward
                investment. The Bank of Ireland looked at the Dungannon area
                but, as an incoming investor itself chose the Newry site. I can
                assure the Member that InterTradeIreland had no role to play. I
                can also assure him that there was no ministerial involvement
                that attempted to steer the Bank of Ireland from one location to
                another. The Department and its agencies were unashamedly
                involved in trying to win investment for Northern Ireland, and
                local political representatives from Dungannon and Newry were
                actively involved in lobbying the bank.</p>

                criticism of Newry. Was consideration given at the trade meeting
                to the continuing crisis in the fuel industry and the ongoing
                problem of illegal transportation of petrol and diesel from the
                Irish Republic? Can the Minister update the Assembly on what
                progress, if any, has been made with Her Majesty’s Treasury on
                this issue?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Finance and Personnel, who
                has now joined us, will be aware that significant efforts have
                been made, and are continually made, to draw to the attention of
                the Chancellor the particular difficulties Northern Ireland is
                experiencing with this. However, it was not dealt with at
                InterTradeIreland’s meeting on 16 February.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also welcome the Minister’s statement.
                However, to follow on from a point made by my Colleague Mr
                McGrady about companies setting up satellite sites in Northern
                Ireland, may I say that I hope that the Minister will keep East
                Antrim foremost in his thoughts. Will he assure us that he is
                committed to bringing economic prosperity to people right across
                Northern Ireland? Can he also assure us that Northern Ireland
                will not become a cheap labour option for firms expanding in the
                South, which want to come north because our minimum wage is
                somewhat less than that in the Irish Republic? If companies
                relocate to the North, will employees here enjoy the
                socio-economic benefits enjoyed by employees of those same
                companies in the South? Moreover, what effect does the Minister
                believe the euro will have on all of this, and may a special
                case need to be made for Northern Ireland?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members really do press well beyond the
                borders of ministerial responsibilities. I must advise, as I
                have done before, that the euro is well beyond the remit even of
                our Minister of Finance and Personnel. However, on the other
                questions the Member raised, I call the Minister to respond.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes, there is no doubt that a coefficient of
                creativity is operating in the House this morning, from
                foot-and-mouth disease to everything that we have in here.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the question of satellite companies, the
                Irish Republic is a target market for inward investment — of
                that there is no doubt. We have achieved, as I said in response
                to a previous question, a significant and increasing degree of
                success. We do market the facts about Northern Ireland. If you
                compare parts of Northern Ireland with the Greater Dublin area,
                you can see that there is a lower cost base. That does not
                necessarily mean cheap wages; it can take account of other
                factors. The supply of labour and the correct type of labour
                are, generally speaking, the most important ingredients when
                choosing Northern Ireland as a location. Because there is
                pressure in the labour market, companies in the Dublin area are
                looking at Northern Ireland as an alternative. We are
                encouraging that, and quite rightly so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, there is no question of Northern
                Ireland’s being sold or marketed as a cheap labour area. We do
                not need to do that because having the people is the priority
                for this sort of company. If the wages are next to nothing and
                there are no people, it does not make any difference. Therefore
                we are focusing on that. In order to improve — and I will try
                to be creative myself and make my answer relevant — we are
                trying to develop the capacity of companies to trade with each
                other and to invest in each other’s jurisdictions. That is one
                of the reasons for the graduate placement scheme that we have
                introduced. I hope you will mark me out of 10 for that, Mr
                Speaker.</p>

                them to the budget. I can assure the Member that the operating
                plan was strictly within the budget limits. We will be
                monitoring that, and it is the responsibility of Ministers to
                ensure that budgets are adhered to. I believe that they must be
                signed off by the Minister of Finance and Personnel, who will

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister recognise that the lack of
              manufacturing businesses in the Moyle area and the higher
              dependence on agriculture — estimated at making up 26% of the
              workforce — have contributed to higher unemployment and social
              deprivation? What is likely to be his Department’s response in
              relation to targeting social need, and what has been the uptake of
              small business set-up grants from LEDU in the Moyle area compared
              to other council areas?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am aware of the Member’s strong views on
              those matters; they have been in evidence whenever I have visited
              the Moyle area, which I have done on several occasions recently.
              The Member is right to say that there is still a high dependence
              on agriculture and tourism. He and his colleagues on the council
              know that we are working hard on the Campbeltown issue and on
              other plans that, we hope, will help.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, there is no disguising the fact that
              there is a lack of facilities in the manufacturing sector in that
              area. There is land available in the council area; there are 4.2
              acres available at Leyland Road. The dependence on agriculture —
              an area of particular concern at the moment — highlights the
              difficulty of creating balanced economies in district council
              areas.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The situation in the Moyle area is not ideal.
              There is dependence on agriculture and tourism, both of which are
              subject to considerable fluctuation. However, LEDU has a number of
              companies in the Moyle District Council area which have received
              letters of offer and are doing reasonably well. I accept that the
              situation is less satisfactory, so far as IDB is concerned.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I assure the Member that there is no lack of
              commitment on the part of the Department or myself to ensure, in
              conjunction with IDB and LEDU, that his district gets as fair a
              share as possible. However, we cannot dictate to companies where
              they should start up. I know that his council is working closely
              with LEDU, under the Business Start programme and other
              programmes, and I hope that that partnership will continue.</p>

              Causeway Coast and Glens tourism consortium, there is real
              potential for the creation of jobs in the tourism industry? Is he
              taking steps to reopen the Ballycastle to Campbeltown ferry
              service?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand that the Moyle District Council
              area has the highest unemployment rate in Northern Ireland. It
              vies with Strabane for that unenviable title, so we must be
              conscious of the difficulties. The Causeway Coast consortium, as
              with many other self-help tourism efforts, deserves our support.
              We work closely with Moyle council, because some of the best
              potential tourist assets anywhere on this island are concentrated
              within that area, and I wish to see it prosper. The Glens, as well
              as the Giant’s Causeway and other sites, present wonderful
              opportunities to bring visitors to the Province.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept that it is a TSN area and that it
              requires special treatment. My Colleague, Dr Farren, is
              particularly aware of the training and employment needs in the
              district. The tourist board will do all that it can to ensure that
              Moyle District Council area is given the best opportunities for
              employment creation.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Leslie:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I note what the Minister said about tourism. He
              is right in saying that the Giant’s Causeway must be the number
              one tourist attraction in Ireland. However, it is not just a
              matter of attracting coaches filled with day trippers, as has been
              the case hitherto. To make a difference to the Moyle District
              Council area, we need visitors to stay overnight, preferably for a
              week or a fortnight. There are plenty of facilities for tourists,
              particularly along the coastline and in the Glens of Antrim, but
              such facilities must be properly promoted.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can the Minister reassure the House that the
              all-Ireland tourist body will not simply be a device for sending
              one-day visitors by coach from the Republic? It should spend a
              sufficient proportion of its budget to ensure that there is a
              significant increase in the number of overnight visitors to the
              area.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue of overnight visitors is key. Coach
              trips are welcome, but recently visitors have been coming to
              Northern Ireland for the day and returning to the Republic to
              spend the night. This is partly due to the currency issue.
              Regrettably it is also because of other circumstances which make
              some overnight stays unsatisfactory. The Northern Ireland Tourist
              Board is acutely aware of the problem. The bulk of profit from
              tourism — apart from people’s visiting amenities — is
              generated by money spent on accommodation, food and entertainment.
              Clearly, the potential spend is at a minimum with a day trip, and
              at a maximum with an overnight stay.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The hon Member is preaching to the converted in
              requiring that emphasis. We do our best to ensure that the
              accommodation is of the highest quality. We have had extensive
              talks with the coach companies, and some of them are increasing
              the number of coach visits to Northern Ireland. However, that
              tends to be at the shoulder of the season because of the problem
              we have in Northern Ireland in the summer. Until that problem is
              resolved, it will be difficult to achieve the desired level of
              overnight stays.</p>

              ensure that the new development agency — through its area
              officers — is adequately manned, to ensure that client
              executives who work with SMEs are not based in Belfast only?</p>

              executives based in particular territories and working from area
              offices? Some in the SME sector feel that the client executive in
              the manufacturing and engineering sectors has to work out of
              Belfast and travel 80 miles to Tyrone or Fermanagh. People feel
              that they are a wee bit left out and that communication and
              consultation is disrupted.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am aware of the point made by a number of
              Members about the agency. I give a commitment that the new agency
              will have a regional dimension; there should be no doubt about
              that. The regional dimension will involve something other than the
              current office structure of LEDU. The IDB, as Members know, does
              not have offices outside Belfast. Therefore, to achieve any
              coherence in helping a local region, the agency must provide a
              comprehensive service to potential customers in the different
              areas within that region. While the detail has not been worked
              out, the commitment to have a regional dimension is absolute. For
              that commitment to be meaningful the agency, through its regional
              offices, must be capable of delivering a holistic service to the
              community.</p>

              welcome his remarks regarding the regional representation of the
              new agency. I am sure he will accept that the greatest potential
              for innovation is in our small and medium-sized businesses. These
              businesses need assistance to turn a dream or a workable idea into
              a reality, thus generating employment.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Team West Tyrone&quot; is very obvious.
              Mr Gibson is not here, but he may emerge at any moment.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland is primarily a small and
              medium-sized enterprise economy, as the Member knows. Well over
              90% of our employers are small to medium-size businesses. It
              follows that unless we have a strategy to address their specific
              needs, we will fail to deal with the potential for growth. In
              other developing economies — and, indeed, in the United States
              — the growth in employment has not been in Fortune 500
              companies; it has been in small to medium-size enterprises.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I assure the Member that, despite a lot of
              publicity inward investment gets, indigenous or small companies
              create the vast majority of new jobs. In an economy, you need
              inward investment to ensure that you bring in new ideas, new
              scales and international connections.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I assure the Member that the emphasis is on
              ensuring that small to medium-sized enterprises have the
              capabilities, are competitive, are provided with the capacity to
              function and the tools to do so. We are trying to do that through
              rolling out broad-band technology, the creation of a new agency,
              training and through a whole range of technical assistance, which
              is currently given by the Industrial Research and Technology Unit.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore the Member can be assured that the
              emphasis will not be largely or exclusively on the attraction of
              inward investment. It will be across the board because that is
              where new jobs will be created.</p>

              he assure me that those small and medium-sized businesses linked
              to tourism will be given the utmost consideration when they put
              their plans forward?</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with the hon Member that the industry
              currently faces a catastrophe. No doubt he will be aware that
              areas over which I have responsibility — namely, the processing
              sector — are also facing a serious situation. While we sit, many
              people are idle, and companies have been effectively suspended,
              unable to send products out of Northern Ireland or to process
              them. Therefore I appreciate acutely the significance of the
              Member’s point.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to tourism, the Assembly treats it
              as a business. That is why it falls under my Department and not
              under the Department of Culture, Media and Sport, as on the
              mainland. The Member will also be aware that the Northern Ireland
              Tourist Board’s business support services will be transferred
              into the new agency which is being established to deal with all
              economic matters. That is being done to ensure high quality and
              consistency in service.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I give the Member the assurance that he seeks:
              we regard tourism businesses as a very viable alternative. Rural
              development, as he is aware, is one of the key themes emerging
              throughout the European Community, and it applies significantly to
              his constituency. Subject to market conditions, we will deal with
              those companies and provide them with the best possible assistance
              available.</p>

              I have recently received an initial proposal for a South/North

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am inclined to agree. However, one has to
              understand that the gas industry in Northern Ireland is
              privatised, and the function of my Department is to regulate along
              with the gas regulator. We can only react and give licences if a
              specific proposal is put to us. So far, Bord Gais in the Republic
              has put forward a proposal, which we are currently evaluating. It
              is the only proposal that has formally been put before us, and we
              will have to deal with that as best we can.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Republic’s decision about where it is
              going to get its new gas supplies has been delayed on a number of
              occasions in the last six weeks, and that has slowed things down.
              There is also the question of the levy and various other matters.
              All I can say is that a firm proposal which has been put to us is
              currently being evaluated, and the hon Member knows only too well
              that we are very keen to see a positive resolution with regard to

              negotiations ongoing to provide natural gas to the south-east of

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The answer to the last part of the Member’s
              question is &quot;Yes&quot;. Regarding the negotiations, I
              personally have had two meetings with representatives of Bord Gais
              in the last six weeks. Discussions are ongoing. So far as Premier
              Transmissions is concerned, I have no proposal from that company
              before me at present. The only one we have is from Bord Gais, and
              we can only deal with the proposal that we have.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course, I have met Premier and other private
              companies on a number of occasions, and it is no secret that I
              personally — and it is the Department’s preferential choice
              — would prefer a North/South pipeline which would supply power
              stations in the Greater Dublin area and a north-west power station
              which would supply Coolkeeragh and allow us to feed the towns en
              route, both south-east and north-west. However, I repeat that we
              are only able to deal with an application if it is in front of us,
              and only one is currently being evaluated.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister believe that it is feasible
              to have both a north-west pipeline and a pipeline that goes to the
              south-east with a North/South interconnector? If he does not
              believe that that is feasible, what is his preference? With regard
              to the value to the economy and the numbers of people using it,
              the south-east pipeline would be perceived by people living in
              that area as being of equal or greater value than that of the
              north-west pipeline.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A meaningful energy market and a competitive
              gas market are both necessary. I want to see an integrated market
              because one power station consumes 20 times more gas than all the
              domestic consumption en route to it. Without the base load, the
              economics of any pipeline are severely restricted. To use an
              analogy, it is like having a shopping centre with no anchor
              tenant.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a scheme available. However, no formal
              application has been made to provide a north-west pipeline to feed
              Coolkeeragh, which would allow the towns en route to access
              natural gas. Similarly, the departmental view is that a
              North/South pipeline should run from Northern Ireland to the
              Republic of Ireland to feed new power station developments in the
              Greater Dublin area, thereby having base loads at each end of the
              two pipes.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That would also create a unified network across
              the island because the Corrib gas field, which is to come
              on-stream, would be able to sell into Northern Ireland’s market
              and we would be able to sell into the Republic of Ireland’s.
              There would then be two pipelines — one to Ballylumford from
              Scotland, and the existing one from Scotland to the Republic of
              Ireland. That is the ideal solution, but the Department of
              Enterprise, Trade and Investment is not in control of matters
              because it is up to the private companies to make their
              applications. The Department can only respond on receipt of those
              applications.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Higher and Further Education,
              Training and Employment has submitted seven bids for Executive
              programme funds. They are bids for: increasing provision for adult
              basic education; improving physical access to further education
              and higher education institutions for disabled people; improving
              links between business and education; a new major further
              education building project; developing on-line service delivery
              and job centres (there are two separate bids for that); and
              developing childminding networks. Those bids amount to £23·48
              million over three years.</p>

              Which of those bids does he consider to be a priority?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Farren:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All the bids are of considerable importance;
              and none would have been made had it not been so. None of them can
              be regarded lightly. However, my priority is adult basic
              education, and I am sure that many Members, if not all, appreciate
              the urgent need to address deficits in basic literacy and numeracy.
              Those have been highlighted by international and domestic reports
              in recent years. Improved physical access for the disabled at
              further and higher education institutions and the improvement of
              links between Northern Ireland business and education partnerships
              also deserve priority.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One in four adults in Northern Ireland has some
              literacy or numeracy difficulty.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we are serious about promoting social
              inclusion and developing a fairer society, this problem must be
              addressed effectively. It is a major barrier to social and
              economic inclusion, which is not always acknowledged. We also need
              to have regard to developments in Great Britain and the Republic
              in which substantial investments have been made. I trust that this
              bid will be successful and that we will not only avoid falling
              behind our neighbours in terms of their provision but will advance
              quite rapidly towards eliminating the deficits among so many in
              our adult population.</p>

              However, we can regard the increases that have been taking place
              as significant and very satisfactory. They indicate the desire and

              in one way or another, the questions associated with student
              financial support. Members will be aware that I have gone to
              considerable lengths to emphasise the importance I place on the
              further education sector, in the House and elsewhere. I have also
              voiced my concern to ensure that students in the sector are as
              adequately supported as possible.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before Christmas, I announced new arrangements

              determination by my Department and the Department of Finance and
              Personnel. I trust that they will be seen as significant

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is the Minister aware that the current
              enrolment for full-time HND courses in the East Down Institute of
              Further and Higher Education is restricted to building
              engineering? Does he agree that with the developments in commerce
              courses must be provided in computing, information technology and
              software engineering if the local community is to sustain itself
              economically? Will the Minister reconsider the restriction on
              full-time courses and allow the East Down Institute of Further and
              Higher Education to expand its curriculum and, therefore, its
              enrolment?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Farren:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over recent years, additional places have been
              made available in the further education sector to enable colleges
              to provide higher education courses such as HNDs.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The allocation of additional places to
              particular colleges must take account of the criteria set down to
              enable colleges to indicate clearly that they are in a position to
              deliver on particular courses. In 1999 the then Department of
              Education awarded the East Down Institute 32 full-time higher
              education places over the next two years in the vocational area of
              construction.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That was the first year in which the Department
              was able to allocate full-time higher education places to the
              institute. All colleges approved to deliver full-time higher
              education must operate within an allocated number of places known
              as the maximum student number — MaSN, as it is generally called.
              It has been noted that the institute has so far used 16 of the 32
              places over the two-year period. The institute’s allocation
              formed part of the additional 600 places allocated to the further
              education sector following the comprehensive spending review. In
              addition, a further cohort of up to 100 HND places in the
              vocational areas of software engineering and electronics have been
              introduced in the current year. Any further increase will be
              dependent on additional resources becoming available and being
              distributed in the light of existing priorities. It will also be
              dependent on the colleges meeting the criteria that have been set
              down, thus demonstrating that they have the capacity to provide
              courses in any particular area.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for his answers. I notice
              that he has placed top priority on the basic skills element of
              further and higher education. Will the Minister assure the House
              that his Department will focus its efforts upon colleges such as
              the East Antrim Institute for Further and Higher Education, to
              enable them to expand the numbers on programmes such as LEAF? That
              initiative is targeted at clients in marginalised estates in
              Newtownabbey, who are currently unable to access the main college
              campus, so that they may benefit from any economic expansion at

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In all the further education colleges that I
              have had the privilege of visiting so far — I am trying to
              include a visit to every college in the current academic year —
              I have been impressed by the extent to which they are involved in
              outreach of the kind referred to by Mr Robinson. In particular, I
              have been impressed with the outreach aimed at providing courses
              in basic skills and, beyond that, in providing opportunities to
              access further and higher education — particularly for those who
              have not had these opportunities before.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department is committed to encouraging all
              the colleges to maintain and expand upon this provision. Obviously
              — as in all these respects — resources are critical in
              determining the extent to which the provision can be made.
              However, it is provision that is being made very effectively by
              many colleges, and — I am pleased to say — many people are
              benefiting from the very determined outreach approach that
              colleges in all parts of Northern Ireland are making in this
              important matter.</p>

              individual basis. As a consequence, a range of initiatives has
              been put in place, including additional targeted higher and
              further education places and additional modern apprenticeships. I

              regarding the ‘Back to your Future’ initiative which my
              Department launched before Christmas. This initiative was designed
              to put current job opportunities before expatriates in the IT and
              telecom sectors — particularly for those with a number of years
              of experience. We are experiencing a considerable shortage of
              experienced personnel in a number of our enterprises and are
              anxious to encourage our own people who have these skills to come
              back and avail of these opportunities. Perhaps Members could play
              a role by bringing news of new opportunities to the attention of
              acquaintances who possess such skills. These openings are
              available on an unprecedented level, offering worthwhile career

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister has referred to the Northern
              Ireland Skills Monitoring Survey, 2000. Of all &quot;difficult to
              fill&quot; vacancies, 43% are based on either a lack of practical
              skills, a lack of technical skills, a lack of qualifications or a
              lack of work experience. What immediate steps can the Minister
              take to address the more prevalent skill shortages? For example,
              the construction industry has a shortage of 60%; business services
              suffer a shortage of 56%; and the manufacturing sector is crippled
              by a shortage of 47%. In addition, the most prevalent external
              skill shortages in the associated professional and technical
              occupations amount to 72%. There is a shortage of 52% among
              managerial and administrative occupations.</p>

              with the report. Lest percentages deceive us, the report
              identifies the fact that only approximately 20% to 21% of surveyed
              employers reported difficulties in recruiting for their vacancies.
              Therefore, a significant majority are not encountering levels of
              difficulty of the kind that the Member has drawn to our attention.
              Of those employers who are encountering difficulties in filling
              vacancies, some have experienced acute levels of difficulty.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the immediate steps we are

              training councils, and we work closely with them on all of the
              training programs. We are also in regular contact with the further
              education colleges and the universities. Therefore numbers are
              increased in accordance with the information available to us in
              respect of training at all levels. We must view our difficulties
              in the context of the pressures that arise on the labour market
              — not just internally in Northern Ireland, but also those
              created by the situations that have emerged in the South.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The need for specific skills in the
              construction industry has obliged businesses to seek workers from
              far beyond the shores of Ireland and Britain. The pressures and
              the associated levels of remuneration cannot be ignored, given the
              effect that they have on our internal labour market. We should not
              be complacent; rather we should continue to monitor and address
              the matter and work with the training providers to ensure that we
              are meeting the needs of all sectors of the economy to the best of
              our ability.</p>

              skilled workers available. There are tailor-made programmes which
              can be put together under the Bridge to Employment initiative.
              Employers who identify particular needs can be assisted by the
              Training and Employment Agency to recruit, and have trained for
              them, workers who can have a very good opportunity to obtain
              employment in those enterprises associated with the Bridge to
              Employment initiative programmes.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have taken further initiatives by holding
              discussions with some of the most recent investors, during which
              we asked them to identify their skills needs and provide
              in-service courses. When workers are recruited they are guaranteed
              opportunities on training programmes — with the support of their
              employers — to acquire certain skills. Such initiatives, and
              many others, demonstrate a very clear determination on the part of
              my Department to meet the skills needs of all investors,
              indigenous or foreign.</p>

              These courses are designed from the outset to make sure that they

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hesitate to suggest that any of the courses

              shortages of experienced workers. Does he agree that on occasions
              employers are their own worst enemies because they impose
              arbitrary restrictions with respect to age, practising a form of
              ageism? They exclude applicants who are aged over 25, 35 or 45.
              Other employers demand graduates when a sub-degree level
              qualification would be adequate for the job in hand.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree up to a point with the Member’s
              comments with respect to the approaches adopted by certain
              employers. In the course of recent surveys it has been identified
              that some employers, when seeking to recruit, demand a higher
              level of qualification than is necessary. Many graduates have had
              to emigrate because they could not obtain employment here. The
              oversupply of graduates may well have conditioned employers to
              seek graduates rather than workers with other levels of skills.
              That is a matter which employers need to address.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With respect to the issue of ageism, employers
              are encouraged to follow the guidance in the voluntary code of
              practice on age diversity in employment which was circulated in
              June 1999 by the then Department of Economic Development. My
              Department also helps older workers back into employment through
              New Deal 50+. Members are probably aware that there is currently
              no legislation on discrimination in employment on grounds of age,
              although we could expect this to be considered in the context of
              the proposed single Equality Bill.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for his positive reply. I
              know that he shares — as do most Assembly Members — our
              concern about the six to eight months’ delay with appeals for
              disability living allowance. Those who suffer from that delay are
              disabled people and people with family problems who are without
              that money for a lengthy period and find it extremely difficult.
              The Minister has indicated that he has put additional personnel on
              the job. Can he mirror the social services unit that is
              specifically dedicated — not seconded to do a part-time job —
              to eradicating this unacceptable delay for those sensitive people
              whose welfare, literally, is dependent on receiving their benefits
              when they are due? He is sympathetic, but we must take more
              specific action.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member is right. I am more than
              sympathetic. We have taken decisive action to address the problem,
              and we hope that we are making a definite impact. I have some
              figures that might interest the Member and the House. There are
              currently 857 appeals to be dealt with by the Disability Living
              Allowance Branch. The number is decreasing steadily, and it is
              estimated that it will be reduced to normal levels by mid-summer.
              There are almost 1,400 to be listed for hearing at a formal
              appeal; that makes a total of 2,257 outstanding appeals. I trust
              that that will, in some way, convey to the Member and the House
              the volume of the workload which we are dealing with effectively.
              Better days lie ahead. I hope that for the Member, for the House
              and for me.</p>

              allowance, what steps is the Minister taking to eradicate what
              have been referred to as &quot;clerical errors&quot; in the
              processing of the forms? Does he agree that perhaps a
              simplification of the form given to those seeking that benefit
              would go a long way towards eradicating the errors, and thus the
              appeal process, which he currently has to deal with?</p>

              It would be much easier for me to stand here and say that we had a
              system that was so simple that everyone’s case would be dealt
              with overnight. I wish that that was the case, but many situations
              must be taken into account. Let me reassure the Member that
              extensive overtime is being worked by the appeals tribunal.
              Moreover, the number of appeal writers has been increased by over
              100% — from 15 to 35. Following a training period for the last
              group of 10, additional staff will start to write appeals from
              this month.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The action taken to manage the build-up in the
              appeals process centres is as follows: six additional staff are
              being recruited; overtime working has been approved;
              cross-training of medical panel members has taken place; the
              average number of weekly sessions for all benefit-related appeals
              has increased from 79 to 93; and additional, legally-qualified and
              medical, panel members will be recruited through the Northern
              Ireland Court Service. There can be only one impact, and that is
              that the situation will get better.</p>

              43,970 unfit dwellings — representing 7·3 % of the total
              housing stock. In the Fermanagh District Council area the figure

              unfit housing is worse in Fermanagh than in anywhere else in
              Ireland, England, Scotland or Wales. The Minister, I am sure, is
              aware that many of those who occupy unfit housing in County
              Fermanagh do so because they made minor mistakes when they were
              filling in their application forms. This resulted in the issue of
              closing orders on those properties. The closing orders, as we
              know, are now preventing some needy cases from making fresh
              applications for replacement dwellings. Does the Minister agree
              that in order to tackle the issue of unfit housing effectively in
              Fermanagh, there is a compelling case for a review of all the
              closing orders that have been issued? Will he direct the Housing
              Executive to get that review underway now?</p>

              constituency as Mr Gallagher, and I am acutely aware of the
              situation that prevails in County Fermanagh. According to housing
              surveys, County Fermanagh is the worst area for housing. The most
              recent house conditions survey, from 1996, shows that Fermanagh
              has the highest percentage of unfit houses in any district council
              area. However, the same survey shows that that situation is being
              remedied in Fermanagh at a faster rate than in any other area.
              Surveys are carried out on a five-yearly basis, and I expect that
              when the next survey is published in 2001 it will show a
              considerable reduction in the unfit housing situation there.</p>

              energy efficiency scheme has been increased from £2·88 million
              to £4 million. If additional funding is required because uptake
              is greater than anticipated — and if work can be undertaken by
              installers — a bid for extra funds will be made during the
              financial year.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last Friday, simultaneously with England,
              Scotland and Wales, I launched the United Kingdom fuel poverty
              strategy. This consultation document outlines the commitment of
              the Government and the devolved administrations to the eradication
              of fuel poverty as far as is practical by 2010. The domestic
              energy efficiency scheme will be the main mechanism by which
              Northern Ireland hopes to reach that target.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We hope to launch the scheme in the spring.
              This period is difficult to gauge because we are not sure what the
              level of uptake will be. We will be in a better position to
              ascertain that once the domestic energy efficiency scheme has been
              launched.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are trying to eradicate fuel poverty as far
              as possible by 2010. I accept that it is guesswork, but it is the
              best guess that we can make. It will be an ongoing process, and we
              will be better able to gauge the size of the problem when the
              scheme is up and running. We do have statistics and figures, but
              those could change as the situation develops.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">asked the Minister for Social Development to
              detail plans he has to extend the proposals under the Domestic
              Energy Efficiency Scheme to those under 60 years of age who are in
              receipt of incapacity and/or disability benefits.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The purpose of the new domestic energy
              efficiency scheme is to focus on the most vulnerable groups living
              in cold homes. Pensioners on low income are deemed to be
              particularly at risk. That is why the scheme provides greater
              benefits for them. However, I accept that the disabled, and those
              in poor health who are under 60 years of age and on low income,
              are in need of support. Such people may be helped by the Housing
              Executive adaptation scheme if they qualify for a disabled
              facilities grant. Whilst there are delays with the process, the
              Housing Executive has been working hard with the Department of
              Health, Social Services and Public Safety to reduce waiting times
              and improve the overall service.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A report on the adaptation process should be
              available for consultation in April 2001. There is scope for the
              new domestic energy efficiency scheme (DEES) to complete other
              grant programmes and vice versa. It will be the responsibility of
              the new scheme manager, when visiting homes, to determine whether
              a householder under the age of 60 with a disability merits
              improved heating standards. Contact will then be made with the
              relevant authorities in order to initiate the application for
              adaptation. That is the best approach for the householder; their
              circumstances can be fully assessed by an occupational therapist.
              The individual’s medical condition may require other adaptations
              to areas such as the bathroom or kitchen. Officials will discuss
              arrangements with the Northern Ireland Housing Executive to allow
              such cases to be fast tracked.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s comments about
              people who suffer from disability. He spoke about the adaptation
              programme, which has experienced considerable delays. Under the
              Programme for Government, the Office of the First Minister and the
              Deputy First Minister has responsibility for ensuring that special
              emphasis be given to the needs not only of the elderly but of the
              disabled and other special groups in the provision of social
              housing. Linked to the Minister’s target of reducing fuel
              poverty in vulnerable households by improving energy efficiency in
              20,000 private sector homes between 2001 and 2004 —</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member should ask a question.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Carrick:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister agree that it is imperative
              that we find the resources to achieve that objective soon?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Morrow:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The question was in that last line. Resources
              are finite. A line must be drawn to prevent the scheme from
              becoming unwieldy and difficult to manage. Resources would become
              diluted and priority groups would suffer. I wish that there were a
              scheme with sufficient finance and resources to support all
              groups. Unfortunately, in the real world that is not the case.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Lewsley:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall return to the original question. I have
              raised the issue of discrimination between applicants for help
              under the scheme. Disabled people under 60 will gain £750 towards
              heating costs; in comparison, people over 60 who receive benefit
              will gain £2,000.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Morrow:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member will recall my acceptance that a
              disabled person or a person in poor health under 60 on low income
              was in need of support. Such a person — if he or she qualifies
              — may be helped by the Housing Executive’s adaptation scheme
              with a disabled facilities grant. Such people could have access to
              that grant and should pursue it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that that addresses the concerns that
              the Member has raised, and I encourage her to direct her
              constituents accordingly.</p>
