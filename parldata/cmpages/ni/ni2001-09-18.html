                <p>Mr Speaker:</p>
                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p>I have received notice from the Minister for Regional
                Development that he wishes to make a statement on the
                cryptosporidium contamination of the Dunore Point water supply,
                which occured in the spring of this year.</p>
                <b>
                <p>The Minister for Regional Development (Mr Campbell):</p>
                </b>
                <p>Thank you, Mr Speaker, for giving me the opportunity to make
                this statement. First, I would like to express my sympathy to
                those who were affected by the cryptosporidiosis outbreak. I
                know how distressing that was for them and for their families. I
                regard the protection of the public water supply as my highest
                priority. The public should be confident that the water is safe
                to drink.</p>
                <p>Information about cryptosporidium and its effects is in the
                public domain, and I have made Members aware of that in previous
                statements to the Assembly. However, for Members’ information,
                I shall recap on the nature of cryptosporidium and the measures
                being taken by the Water Service to minimise the risk of its
                entering the water supply. I shall also outline the history of
                the cryptosporidiosis outbreak in the spring that led to the
                identification of the Dunore Point water supply as its probable
                source. An investigation into the contamination of the Dunore
                Point water supply was carried out by a team led by Prof Adrian
                Long of Queen’s University. I shall provide details of that
                investigation to the House and set out the steps that the Water
                Service is taking to implement Prof Long’s recommendations.</p>
                <p>Cryptosporidiosis is a diarrhoeal illness caused by a
                microscopic parasite called cryptosporidium.</p>
                <p>In a healthy person the illness usually clears up by itself,
                but this may take a week or more. People who have problems with
                their immune system, including those with HIV infection or AIDS,
                those receiving chemotherapy treatment for cancer, and
                transplant patients, are more at risk of serious or prolonged
                illness.</p>
                <p>Cryptosporidium is present in the environment at low levels
                at all times. There are several sources of infection, such as
                contact with infected animals, contaminated food, foreign travel
                and person-to-person spread. It can also be spread through the
                public water supply.</p>
                <p>Following outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis in Great Britain,
                the Government appointed an expert group to advise on measures
                to protect the public against cryptosporidium in drinking water.
                The group was initially chaired by Sir John Badenoch and then by
                Prof Ian Bouchier. It reported in 1990, 1995 and 1998 and made
                many recommendations on measures to mitigate the risk of
                cryptosporidium entering water supplies. These recommendations
                were all adopted by the Water Service and are being implemented.</p>
                <p>Measures already taken include: carrying out cryptosporidium
                risk assessments at all 59 water supply sources; rigorous
                cryptosporidium sampling and testing programmes; and the
                development of effective protocol arrangements with the medical
                authorities and the drinking water inspector. High priority is
                being given to the provision and upgrading of water treatment
                works to ensure effective barriers to cryptosporidium, involving
                expenditure of £140 million over the next five years. The
                replacement of the Mourne and Lagmore conduits to prevent
                ingress has involved expenditure of £40 million.</p>
                <p>On 13 April 2001 Dr Morgan, consultant in communicable
                disease control with the Eastern Health and Social Services
                Board, informed the Water Service of an increase in clinically
                diagnosed cryptosporidiosis in the community of the central
                Belfast area.</p>
                <p>The Water Service immediately initiated a wide series of
                precautionary measures. These included: instigating category 1
                major incident procedures with incident management teams being
                set up at divisional level and at head office; taking the
                Woodburn conduit out of service and carrying out a CCTV survey
                of it for signs of possible ingress of untreated water; the
                redistribution of water from various sources to compensate for
                the removal of the conduit; the introduction of 24-hour
                continuous sampling; the intensification of leakage repairs in
                the area to conserve water supplies; establishing formal lines
                of communication with the Eastern Health and Social Services
                Board, and providing additional customer call-handling
                arrangements.</p>
                <p>Dr Morgan convened a meeting of the outbreak control team on
                Monday 16 April. The team comprised officials from the Water
                Service, the Eastern Health and Social Services Board and
                Belfast City Council. Water samples indicated that the level of
                cryptosporidium present in the water was low and well within
                national standards. Having reviewed the available information,
                Dr Morgan considered the water safe to use and to drink. The
                outbreak control team met on six occasions between 19 April and
                8 May, reviewing the situation constantly.</p>
                <p>By 19 April geographic mapping of cases by the Water Service
                had identified Dunore Point water supply area as a possible
                common link. Over the weekend of 21 to 22 April investigations
                concentrated on the Dunore Point treatment works. These revealed
                that a defect to the site drainage system may have allowed the
                ingress of a small quantity of contaminated water along a cable
                duct to the outlet of slow sand filters. The cable duct was
                immediately sealed and repairs to the site drainage system were
                undertaken, which ensured that no further ingress of
                contaminated water could occur. A significant concentration of
                cryptosporidium oocysts was also detected in the septic tank
                located at the treatment works.</p>
                <p>The outbreak control team considered that the defective sewer
                had been the most likely source of the outbreak. On 23 May Dr
                Morgan issued a press statement confirming that cases of
                cryptosporidiosis had returned to the usual seasonal level and
                declaring the outbreak to be over.</p>
                <p>Three hundred and six cases of cryptosporidiosis were
                notified during the outbreak in the Eastern and Northern Health
                Board areas. The normal investigation into the cryptosporidiosis
                outbreak by the outbreak control team is underway, and its
                report is due later this year. The Water Service is assisting
                fully with this investigation.</p>
                <p>On 27 April, I commissioned an independent investigation into
                the cause of the contamination of the water supply at Dunore
                Point. The investigation was led by Prof Adrian Long of Queen’s
                University, Belfast. Prof Long was assisted by Randal Scott, the
                Northern Ireland drinking water inspector, Harry Thompson, the
                technical director of the Water Service, and Dr Pauline
                Mackinnon, lecturer in environmental engineering at Queen’s
                University, Belfast. Prof Long’s report was recently presented
                to me, and it is clear that the team’s investigation has been
                detailed and comprehensive. I thank Prof Long and his team for
                the thoroughness and promptness of the investigation.</p>
                <p>The team considered a number of possible sources of
                contamination and concluded that the most likely source was
                dilute sewage, which was transmitted via the cable ducts to the
                outlet channels of the slow sand filters. However, the report
                indicated that for this to have happened, a combination of a
                number of factors was required. These factors include the
                contamination of the sewer with cryptosporidium; leakage from
                the sewer; leakage from a water main in the vicinity of the
                leaking sewer, which acted as a carrier for the sewage; blockage
                of the drainage outlet from the cable ducts, and openings
                between cable ducts and filter outlets left unsealed.</p>
                <p>Prof Long’s report stresses that if any one of the factors
                had not occurred, it is unlikely that contamination would have
                resulted. Nevertheless, I accept that, apart from the
                contamination of the sewer with cryptosporidium, each of the
                factors could have been prevented.</p>
                <p>The report concludes that the Water Service staff acted
                promptly and professionally when the results of the
                cryptosporidium tests showed higher than anticipated values in
                the water supply. I endorse this conclusion, and I thank all the
                Water Service staff involved for their hard work,
                professionalism and dedication.</p>
                <p>The report makes a number of recommendations to reduce the
                risk of further cryptosporidium contamination of the treated
                water at Dunore Point and other comparable works. These include
                changes to the infrastructure; procedures for the operation,
                maintenance and monitoring of treatment works; procedures for
                personnel at treatment works; design issues; the replacement of
                pipes and conduits vulnerable to ingress, and the implementation
                of similar reviews for other treatment works.</p>
                <p>A copy of the report has been placed in the Assembly Library
                and is available to Members. An executive summary has been
                distributed to members of the Committee for Regional
                Development.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, the Water Service prepared an action plan to
                implement the recommendations at Dunore Point and other similar
                treatment works. I stress to Members the seriousness with which
                I regard this incident and assure them that the implementation
                of Prof Long’s recommendations is underway — this is being
                treated as a top priority by the Water Service. Substantial
                progress has already been made in implementing the
                recommendations at Dunore Point, and target dates have been set
                for implementation at other installations.</p>
                <b>
                <p>The Chairperson of the Committee for Regional Development (Mr
                A Maginness):</p>
                </b>
                <p>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive report on the
                cryptosporidium contamination of the water supply at Dunore
                Point. I express the sympathy of the Committee for Regional
                Development to those who were adversely affected by the
                outbreak.</p>
                <p>The Minister outlined five failings in the system related to
                Dunmore Point. A combination of factors could have contributed
                to the contamination. Although I understand the substance of
                Prof Long’s report and accept that a combination of factors
                was involved, it is a poor reflection on the Water Service that
                these factors existed and contributed to the outbreak of
                cryptosporidiosis.</p>
                <p>The Water Service is to be congratulated for dealing with the
                outbreak promptly.</p>

                <b>
                <p>Mr A Maginness:</p>
                </b>
                <p>I understand the recommendations that have been made and
                their implementation, but can the Minister assure us that there
                will not be another outbreak at that location? It is worrying
                that the situation arose, and the public demands an assurance
                that it will not occur again.</p>
                <i>
                <p>10.45 am</p>
                </i><b>
                <p>Mr Campbell:</p>
                </b>
                <p>I thank the Committee Chairperson for his question and his
                comments about the professionalism of the Water Service. He asks
                for an assurance, but the nature of this problem is such that it
                is virtually impossible to give a categorical assurance that
                there will be no further outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis, given
                that low levels of cryptosporidium exist all the time.</p>
                <p>I have no hesitation in giving an assurance that every
                possible step is being taken to ensure that the possibility of
                future outbreaks is minimised. All the recommendations from Prof
                Long’s report have been, or are being, implemented. I hope and
                expect that that will minimise any future outbreak in so far as
                it is possible to do so. The wholesomeness of the public water
                supply is a top priority, and the public should be able to have
                confidence in its drinking water supply.</p>

                <p>The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for Regional
                Development (Mr McFarland):</p>
                </b>
                <p>I thank the Minister for his statement. However, I am
                concerned, because I recall that after the two outbreaks in 2000
                on the Mourne and Lagmore conduits we were assured that the
                Water Service had checked everything. Similarly, it was stated
                that in so far as it was possible to determine, given the
                ambient level of cryptosporidium, everything had been solved. I
                am concerned that several problems were not solved at that time.
                I am aware of the overall cost of replacing entire systems, but
                the report has made certain recommendations; what will it cost
                to implement them?</p>
                <b>
                <p>Mr Campbell:</p>
                </b>
                <p>I repeat that attempts are being made to ensure that
                outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis are kept to a minimum. It is
                difficult, because cryptosporidium is in the water supply at low
                levels throughout the year, and at certain times it occurs at
                higher levels.</p>
                <p>I assure the Deputy Chairperson that the Water Service is
                doing all that it can to ensure that continuous efforts are made
                and measures put in place so that the public can have confidence
                in the water supply.</p>
                <p>A range of recommendations is being implemented. Some are
                short-term measures and do not have significant resource
                implications, but others have substantial resource implications.
                I refer the Member to the replacement of the Mourne and Lagmore
                conduits. Those alone cost £40 million. The upgrading of water
                treatment works will make for a more effective barrier to
                cryptosporidium, but, as I said in my statement, that will cost
                £140 million over the next five years. It will be a costly
                exercise, but those measures must be put in place. I will apply
                for every possible resource to ensure public confidence in the
                water supply.</p>
                <b>
                <p>Mr Close:</p>
                </b>
                <p>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive statement, but I
                am sure that he will forgive me if I say that it is a case of
                déjà vu. This is beginning to become something of an annual
                event; exactly a year ago the Minister gave a similar report,
                following the outbreak in my constituency and bordering areas.</p>
                <p>Does the Minister agree that the entire infrastructure and
                supply of water, and also the sewerage infrastructure, is
                crumbling into disrepair, and that that is the major cause of
                these outbreaks? Today’s report deals with Dunore Point, but
                there have also been outbreaks in Silent Valley, the Poleglass
                reservoir, the Northern Service reservoir and Lagmore conduit.
                Where will it end? Whose water will be next?</p>
                <p>Does the Minister agree that cryptosporidiosis should now
                become a notifiable disease, because of the difficulties and
                potential difficulties for the elderly and those suffering from
                the illnesses that he already mentioned? Does he agree that the
                Department is failing in its duty to the general public to
                provide a wholesome water supply?</p>
                <b>
                <p>Mr Campbell:</p>
                </b>
                <p>I will answer the final question first. I do not accept that
                the Department is failing in its duty. If the Member peruses the
                statement, he will see the lengths to which the Department is
                going to ensure continued public confidence in the water supply.</p>
                <p>The substance of the Member’s questions brings us to the
                nub of the problem. For about 30 years, we have had a continuous
                cycle of underinvestment in water treatment works and in the
                provision of a public water supply. The events of the past two
                or three years are indicative of that underinvestment. I do not
                want to mislead the Member or the House by saying that all
                cryptosporidium outbreaks occurred because of underinvestment,
                but there is no doubt that a substantial majority of them did.</p>
                <p>For that very reason, I have made continuous bids to increase
                the amount of money available for the Water Service to put
                effective barriers to cryptosporidium in place, as well as the
                other benefits that water treatments bring. I welcome Mr Close’s
                support for that, and I hope that if the House votes for moneys
                in the near future, the Water Service will receive additional
                funding.</p>
                <b>
                <p>Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p>Mr Close asked a question about notifiable disease status.
                That is not an area of responsibility for the Minister for
                Regional Development. However, the Member may wish to put the
                question to the Minister who has responsibility for disease
                notification.</p>
                <b>
                <p>Mr ONeill:</p>
                </b>
                <p>I too welcome the Minister’s statement. The open and honest
                approach goes some way to reassure the public about the causes
                of this outbreak, and I thank him for that. Is it not then
                incumbent on the Minister to apply the same standards of
                openness to the other outbreaks? I refer in particular to the
                outbreak resulting from the Silent Valley issue. It was made
                quite clear in the Eastern Health and Social Services Board’s
                report that a deficiency in the infrastructure in the Saintfield
                area led to that ingress. Does the Minister agree that it is
                totally unjust that the ban on grazing for the Mourne farmers is
                allowed to continue? Those poor farmers were subject to a savage
                and punitive situation during the foot-and-mouth disease crisis.
                Is it not unjust that they should suffer doubly because of
                miscalculation and inefficient infrastructure? It is not their
                fault.</p>
                <b>
                <p>Mr Campbell:</p>
                </b>
                <p>The Member raised the Silent Valley issue previously
                mentioned by others. He knows that I have responded to oral and
                written questions on this and have met a delegation of farmers.
                I sympathise with their plight. However, given the circumstances
                and the advice to me from the Water Service and the medical
                authorities, I had no alternative but to take the actions that I
                took. I hope for and expect Mr ONeill’s support to obtain
                sufficient resources to enable the speedy replacement of the
                Mourne conduit. That would assist the farmers, whose position we
                both support, to return to their grazing lands.</p>
                <b>
                <p>Mr J Wilson:</p>
                </b>
                <p>Like others, I thank the Minister for the openness and
                honesty of his statement and for his warning that these matters
                should be taken very seriously. However, is he really surprised
                that people in Northern Ireland, having consumed some of our
                water, become ill from time to time?</p>
                <p>In my constituency, the Six Mile Water pours human waste,
                toiletries, bathroom and personal hygiene items into Lough Neagh
                every day. I can give Members a more graphic description should
                it be required. I can only assume that if that is happening on
                the Six Mile Water, it also happens on the Moyola, the Upper
                Bann and the Ballinderry rivers.</p>
                <p>Is the Minister aware that an officer of the Ulster Angling
                Federation was recently taken to Dunore Point on the lough
                shore? He tossed a pebble into the water and it did not sink.
                What he saw there was pure gunge.</p>
                <p>To bring the Minister up to date, is he aware that reports
                are reaching the angling fraternity and the local press that
                Lough Neagh is now throwing up dead dollaghan trout on the water
                surface? Is he really surprised that people are becoming ill
                after drinking water?</p>
                <b>
                <p>Mr Campbell:</p>
                </b>
                <p>There is no doubt that from time to time in several rivers in
                Northern Ireland there are items that make the provision of a
                clean water supply more difficult. I will investigate the status
                of the Six Mile Water and other rivers and write to the Member
                when I receive a report on it. The Member also referred to
                Dunore Point on Lough Neagh.</p>
                <p>I will have those checked, and I will write to the Member
                when I receive the information.</p>

                <b><font SIZE="3">
                <p>The Minister of the Environment (Mr Foster):</p>
                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p>I beg to move</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p>That the Second Stage of the Local Government (Best Value)
                Bill (NIA19/00) be agreed.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p>The Bill will remove the statutory requirement for the
                compulsory competitive tendering (CCT) of selected services and
                in the interests of council residents and district ratepayers
                establish in its place a new framework of best value.</p>
                <p>Few Members will mourn the passing of CCT. When I was a
                district councillor, I had no great love for CCT, which seemed
                at times to place too much emphasis on costs rather than on
                quality of services. CCT did, however, bring to local government
                a useful focus on value for money in the delivery of key
                services. It was, therefore, a policy that had the interests of
                residents and ratepayers at heart. Under best value, I am keen
                to promote greater transparency and accountability in the use of
                council resources and in the provision of local services to
                council residents and ratepayers. The Bill is an essential step
                towards achieving those objectives — it is a Bill for local
                people.</p>
                <p>&quot;Best value&quot; is, of course, an expression that is
                not yet familiar to most residents and ratepayers in Northern
                Ireland’s 26 council areas. However, the Bill is highly
                relevant to the local issues that impinge on the everyday lives
                of the people whom Assembly Members and district councillors
                represent. It seeks to promote quality services for council
                residents at a price that local district ratepayers are prepared
                to pay. It does not simply pursue the lowest cost option. Unlike
                CCT, the Local Government (Best Value) Bill will require
                district councils to review all of their services in
                consultation with local people and to seek areas for improvement
                in the quality of service and in value for money.</p>
                <p>Best value is not a new concept for local government in
                Northern Ireland. In 1998, all 26 district councils agreed to
                implement best value voluntarily in advance of primary
                legislation. A joint departmental local government steering
                group was set up to oversee the implementation, and key tasks
                were assigned to a number of joint working groups chaired by
                district council chief executives. My Department also introduced
                subordinate legislation to defer the further implementation of
                CCT while the best value initiative was being progressed.</p>
                <p>Some might ask why we need the Bill. There are two main
                reasons. First, the requirement for CCT has merely been deferred
                by subordinate legislation; it remains on the statute book.
                Legal advice is that it cannot be further deferred in that way.
                That means that the CCT obligation becomes effective again on 1
                April 2002, unless it is repealed before that date. Secondly,
                experience to date of the voluntary implementation of best value
                indicates that a statutory framework for best value is essential
                if we are to deliver the transparency, accountability and
                consistency that council residents and ratepayers deserve.</p>
                <p>While councils have, as expected, taken the opportunity to
                stand down CCT, they have not yet fully implemented some key
                aspects of best value and have called for further detailed
                guidance to ensure that there is an effective and consistent
                approach. That strongly suggests that a statutory framework is
                the best way of promoting the interests of local people with
                regard to quality and value for money in council services.</p>
                <p>I say that without rancour towards councils, which I regard
                as having filled the democratic gap in Northern Ireland during
                30 years of direct rule. Members may argue that the best value
                framework might be too prescriptive and bureaucratic. They may
                also contend that councils should be given the scope and
                flexibility to seek continuous improvement on their own terms.
                Such views have merit. Those points were raised with me when I
                discussed an earlier, much more detailed and prescriptive draft
                Bill with the Environment Committee.</p>
                <p>I reflected carefully on those points, and I have
                substantially altered the draft Bill. However, I have done that
                without prejudice to the sensitive principle that council
                residents and ratepayers are entitled to transparency,
                accountability and consistency in the delivery of council
                services. People are entitled to be given a say in the
                determination of council priorities for the area in which they
                live. People are entitled to know how their council is
                performing and to have the opportunity to contribute to its
                plans.</p>
                <p>Ratepayers are also entitled to an assurance that their money
                is being well spent and that every effort is being made to
                provide quality services. Such an assurance can be provided only
                after a robust, independent scrutiny of council activity. The
                Local Government (Best Value) Bill makes provision for delivery
                on all of those counts. At the same time, I have gone to some
                length to ensure that the proposed statutory framework is not
                over-prescriptive. Moreover, I assured the Environment Committee
                that I would avoid over-prescription in the implementation of
                the framework. I repeat that assurance to the House today,
                because it is an important one.</p>
                <p>Current best value procedures allow for different approaches
                to suit local circumstances. For example, at present councils
                can determine the means by which they engage local people in
                consultation, and, through local targets and performance
                indicators, they can demonstrate to the residents and ratepayers
                how they are performing year on year. The implementation
                guidance in the Bill will allow for appropriate local variation.
                Inevitably, any new framework will involve time, effort and
                resources — best value is no exception.</p>
                <p>I am committed to taking all genuine opportunities to
                streamline the process. However, the proposed framework should
                instil some consistency of approach, enabling councils to learn
                from one another, while improving transparency and
                accountability for residents and ratepayers. That should prevent
                unnecessary duplication of effort, while promoting continuous
                improvement through meaningful benchmarking.</p>
                <p>I do not deny that, during the consultation process,
                significant reservations were expressed by the local government
                sector. In particular, there was a genuine concern that my
                Department would use subordinate legislation to establish a
                framework that would place more emphasis on process than on
                outcomes. It was feared that that would stifle innovation and
                flexibility of approach. I have made it clear that I am opposed
                to such an approach.</p>
                <p>The Bill makes provision for a robust framework that will
                allow for the sensitive and practical development of the best
                value concept. Emphasis will be placed on the use of
                departmental circulars for setting out the operational
                requirements of best value, rather than subordinate legislation,
                as previously proposed. That will allow us to continue and
                strengthen our partnership with local government to develop
                further guidance. I propose to establish a joint working group
                to develop the necessary guidance on implementation. That will
                make best use of the expertise of local government
                representatives and officials, to the benefit of the 26 district
                councils, their residents and ratepayers.</p>
                <p>The Bill now comprises 11 clauses, as opposed to the 19 that
                were proposed at consultation stage. Clause 1 describes the best
                value duty and applies it to all district councils in Northern
                Ireland. The clause sets out a requirement that councils should
                systematically review all their functions and prepare plans to
                address any deficiencies. Councils will be required to consult
                widely with their communities, and that will give people more
                influence over council priorities for their area. Clause 2
                empowers the Department to issue guidance to councils on how the
                duty of best value is to be discharged. Councils have requested
                such guidance, on the understanding that they will have input
                into its development. As I have said, I am committed to such
                engagement.</p>
                <p>Clauses 3 and 4 deal with the arrangements for the audit of
                best value. That will give local people, the Department and the
                Assembly the assurance that council activities are subject to
                independent scrutiny. The Bill will allow the local government
                auditor to undertake an audit of every council’s performance
                improvement plans and to report on whether they are consistent
                with the legislation and any guidance issued by the Department.
                Other provisions will enable the auditor to examine all aspects
                of a council’s approach to best value in more detail. On
                completion of an audit, the auditor will produce a report of his
                or her findings. Any such report will highlight areas of concern
                and make recommendations for either the council or the
                Department to act on.</p>
                <p>Clause 5 outlines councils’ responsibilities following
                receipt of an auditor’s report. If the report contains
                recommendations, a council will be required to prepare a
                statement outlining its views on those recommendations and
                saying, in appropriate circumstances, how and when it proposes
                to address the issues raised. Such statements will be forwarded
                to the Department and will be included in the council’s next
                performance improvement plan.</p>
                <p>Significantly, councils will be required to publish an
                auditor’s report, thereby improving transparency for local
                people. Such reports will be valuable sources of information for
                local residents and ratepayers as well as for councillors,
                council staff and the Department. The provision for independent
                scrutiny and accountability checks will enable the Department,
                councils and the local government auditor to work together on
                promoting the delivery of quality local services.</p>
                <p>Clause 6 deals with non-commercial considerations. Article 19
                of the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Northern
                Ireland) Order 1992 specifies matters that councils should not
                take into account when awarding council contracts. However, in
                certain circumstances, it is possible that some of those matters
                may be deemed relevant to procurement objectives. The clause,
                therefore, gives the Department powers, subject to Assembly
                approval, to specify, through subordinate legislation, matters
                that are no longer deemed to be non-commercial. We would, of
                course, ensure that any such proposal to use those powers would
                take account of the procurement review being undertaken by the
                Department of Finance and Personnel.</p>
                <p>Clause 7 makes provision for my Department to disapply a
                council’s statutory obligations under best value, either for
                individual councils or for local government as a whole. That
                power would be exercisable through subordinate legislation. At
                this stage, I do not envisage any circumstances in which that
                power would be used, so its inclusion is for reasons of
                contingency.</p>
                <p>Clause 8 is simply an interpretation of key references in the
                Bill.</p>
                <p>Clause 9 lists the changes to primary legislation
                necessitated by the Bill. The main change will be the repeal of
                Part II of the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions)
                (Northern Ireland) Order 1992, which makes provision for
                compulsory competitive tendering.</p>
                <p>I would like to emphasise two points. First, it is crucial
                that we make progress with the Local Government (Best Value)
                Bill if we are to avoid the reinstatement by default of
                compulsory competitive tendering as a statutory obligation for
                2002-03. I believe that there is consensus on that, although it
                undoubtedly creates pressure on the Assembly and my Department,
                given our tight schedule.</p>
                <p>Secondly, Members will have noted my recurring reference to
                the need for transparency, accountability and consistency, in
                the interests of council residents and ratepayers. I make no
                apologies for that deliberate repetition. When I was first
                appointed Minister of the Environment, I was still a councillor.
                However, when I became conscious that my appointment gave rise
                to potential conflicts of interest, I took steps to avoid those
                conflicts. The mere possibility of potential conficts of
                interest eventually led me to resign my seat on Fermanagh
                District Council.</p>
                <p>About 60 of my fellow MLAs retain a dual mandate as
                councillors and Assembly Members. It is perfectly in order that
                they do so. However, that dual mandate undoubtedly carries with
                it an added responsibility. The Assembly must assure the public
                that the framework created for local government is transparent,
                accountable and subject to independent scrutiny. In particular,
                we must reassure council residents and ratepayers that the
                legislative powers of the Assembly are not being used to deny
                them that transparency, accountability and independent scrutiny.</p>
                <p>The challenge is to create a balanced framework that is
                proportionate and practicable, but is also sufficiently robust
                to ensure that the legitimate needs of ratepayers and residents
                are met. I believe that the Bill does strike the necessary
                balance, and I commend it to the Assembly.</p>
                <i>
                <p>11.15 am</p>
                </i><b>
                <p>The Chairperson of the Committee for the Environment (Rev Dr
                William McCrea):</p>
                </b>
                <p>I thank the Minister for his speech this morning. It is true
                that many members of my Committee are also members of district
                councils, and they declared that at the time.</p>
                <p>As Chairperson of the Committee for the Environment, I wish
                to register with Members and also the Minister, a number of
                concerns that the Committee still has about the Bill. On 6
                April, the Committee formally responded to the Department’s
                best value consultation document. We questioned not only the
                timing of the Bill but the need for it to be so detailed and
                prescriptive. At that time, the Department was proposing a
                21-clause Bill as opposed to an 11-clause Bill, and I
                acknowledge that the Minister has taken some of our concerns
                into consideration.</p>
                <p>We carefully considered the policy memorandum and saw the
                purpose of the Bill. Members of my Committee objected to few of
                the stated purposes including the repeal of the existing
                provision for compulsory competitive tendering (CCT). Few
                councils are sad to see the demise of CCT. The Bill will also
                give councils a duty to make arrangements for continuous
                improvements in all their functions — who would not want that?
                The question is whether it should be done in a compulsory way,
                through the Bill, or voluntarily, as is already happening.</p>
                <p>The Committee has recommended a two-clause Bill, which would
                repeal CCT and simply put a best value general duty on councils
                to seek continuous improvements. I respect the fact that the
                Minister has made changes to the initial draft brought to my
                Committee. It seems that this Bill is less prescriptive,
                particularly on the audit of best value plans and reviews, and
                places more emphasis on the use of departmental circulars and
                consultation than on subordinate legislation. It drops clauses
                on best value inspections, costs recovery via prosecutions and
                performance improvement plans. It puts a duty on councils to
                seek best value and to make arrangements for continuous
                improvement. That is better than the original statement about
                securing continuous improvement.</p>
                <p>The Committee wrote to the 26 district councils in January
                and March. We heard directly from representatives of three
                councils, the local government auditor, the Association for
                Public Service Excellence and, of course, our Minister of the
                Environment and his senior officials. Several of the councils
                questioned the need for legislation, saying that they had been
                voluntarily operating best value for two years. It was
                acknowledged by many, inside and outside the Department, that
                that had been successful.</p>
                <p>The councils also questioned the timing of the introduction
                of best value legislation, given the pending review of public
                administration in Northern Ireland. To date, Members have heard
                much talk about this review, but little has been done about it.
                Councils also argued that the best value framework used in Great
                Britain was not applicable to Northern Ireland district
                councils, which have more limited roles and budgets.</p>
                <p>The Committee, therefore, sees merit in extending the
                non-statutory approach to implementing best value, as currently
                happens in Scotland. That would allow us time to develop and
                strengthen the partnership and improve communications between
                local government and central Government. It would also allow
                councils time to develop good practice and improve transparency,
                accountability and value for money, which are key components of
                councils’ procurement and service delivery.</p>
                <p>Who would deny the importance of improved transparency? Who
                would not want accountability or value for money? As ratepayers,
                we certainly desire those, but is the Minister’s approach —
                to race ahead with the legislation — the appropriate one?</p>
                <p>Improved transparency, accountability and value for money are
                essential, and that applies as much to the Department and its
                activities as to the district councils and theirs. The Executive
                contribute to the Bill, and they consider accountability in
                local government to be in need of improvement to provide more
                transparency for ratepayers and those who rely on council
                services. However, that could also be said about the Executive.
                My Committee discussed the 11-clause Bill. We had serious
                reservations about it, but we undertook to scrutinise it
                rigorously, clause by clause, at Committee Stage and report in
                full to the Assembly.</p>
                <p>We noted the Department’s letter of 22 August, which said
                that, at the meeting between local government and departmental
                officials, it was unanimously agreed that, unlike compulsory
                competitive tendering, best value offered district councils the
                opportunity to improve quality services. It also said that the
                revised draft legislation was endorsed unanimously as an
                acceptable basis for developing best value. Can the Minister
                confirm that that is correct? Did the district councils ask
                whether that statement referred to local government throughout
                Northern Ireland or just to the limited number of officials who
                happened to be at the meeting? How will the Bill address my
                concerns? Will the Minister explain why extending the
                non-statutory approach to implementing best value is not a
                viable option?</p>
                <b>
                <p>Mr A Doherty:</p>
                </b>
                <p>This is an important Bill, and we need to get it right, for
                it reaches the heart of what politics — local and national,
                should be about — quality of life.</p>
                <p>I look from three perspectives. First, the perspective of the
                SDLP, which, from its beginning, has worked to build the
                partnerships and communities — social, economic and political
                — that are essential to the achievement of that quality of
                life. Secondly, in 24 years as a district councillor, I have
                promoted the importance of partnerships as the best method of
                giving best value. Good councillors of every persuasion, despite
                their differences, have been united in their commitment to
                giving good service and good value to their constituents, making
                a major contribution to keeping Northern Ireland from sinking
                into the abyss that still opens up before us. Thirdly, I speak
                as a member of the Environment Committee, which is charged with
                giving serious consideration to the points that will be made
                during the debate and to the responses of the Minister and his
                Department. There are still many small-print points that must be
                examined.</p>
                <p>I have some general questions: why the hurry; why only local
                government; why not the Department itself; why not Big Brother
                — central Government? Why impose this on councils that may
                soon be abolished or, God forbid, subsumed into a few
                supercouncils? The reasons given by the Department in support of
                the revised Bill are worthy of close scrutiny.</p>
                <p>The Bill is</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p>&quot;to make provision imposing on district councils
                requirements relating to economy, efficiency and effectiveness;
                and for connected purposes&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p>The requirements relating to economy, efficiency and
                effectiveness are admirable and acceptable, depending on how
                they will be imposed. They concentrate on the processes, which
                might effect a limited sort of best value. We hope that the need
                for councils to provide best value services that take account of
                the human needs of the community, council workers and other
                stakeholders are covered under the last three words, &quot;for
                connected purposes&quot;.</p>
                <p>In its response to the draft Bill, the SDLP made that point,
                with regard to the absence of an equality impact assessment and
                the fact that both new targeting social need and equality
                considerations should be taken into account in local government
                procurement. I am not sure that the revised Bill has taken up
                those points.</p>
                <p>We can readily accept the assurance of the central management
                branch that best value offers district councils the opportunity
                to provide quality services with an emphasis on public
                consultation and with transparency, accountability and value for
                money as key components in procurement and service delivery. To
                help councils, the Department may</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p>&quot;issue guidance to councils as to the carrying out of
                their functions&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p>That is in clause 2(1). Obviously, councils will, at times,
                need guidance, but what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the
                gander. It is surely in order to suggest that, before it issues
                its guidelines, the Department should consult the councils and
                other stakeholders fully. I take on board the Minister’s words
                this morning about discussions with councils.</p>
                <p>That is just one suggestion of the many that, I am sure, will
                be made during the debate and the Committee Stage. District
                councils are already heavily and voluntarily engaged in seeking
                to provide best value in all their services. Before the Bill
                becomes law, we must be satisfied that, as an Assembly officer
                said, the statutory framework for best value is</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p>&quot;essential if we are to deliver the transparency,
                accountability and consistency to which council residents and
                ratepayers are entitled.&quot;</p>
                </font><b><font SIZE="3">
                <p>Mr McLaughlin:</p>
                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p>Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I want to give a
                broad welcome to the concept and contents of the Bill, while
                expressing some concerns that can be more properly dealt with in
                detail in Committee, if we ever get that far. The Bill will
                require district councils to make arrangements for continuous
                improvement in all their functions. It is designed to replace
                compulsory competitive tendering and is a recognition that CCT
                was too rigid and, on occasions, prevented councils from acting
                in the best interests of their communities. In other words, it
                was a failed and counterproductive concept.</p>
                <p>Services and contracts will be judged not just on cost but on
                the balance of economy, efficiency and effectiveness. Obviously,
                that is to be welcomed, because it allows local government
                services and functions to be carried out in a manner that
                encourages the targeting of social need and embraces human
                rights and equality considerations.</p>
                <i>
                <p>11.30 am</p>
                </i>
                <p>I welcome the changes that have been made to the Bill since
                its original drafting. Many of the concerns expressed by the
                Environment Committee and by district councils have been taken
                into account. I welcome and acknowledge the responsiveness of
                the Minister and his advisers to those concerns. The Bill is now
                less prescriptive, particularly on the auditing of best value
                plans and reviews. It places more emphasis on the use of
                departmental circulars and consultation, rather than on
                subordinate legislation. It has dropped best value inspections
                and cost recovery via prosecutions and the section on
                performance improvement plans. It now provides a duty of best
                value that requires councils to make arrangements for continuous
                improvement, rather than to secure continuous improvement.</p>
                <p>However, I remain to be convinced that we require
                back-to-back repeal of CCT and the introduction of best value on
                a statutory basis now. The Committee Chairperson comprehensively
                and scrupulously outlined the general view of the Committee on
                that matter. I note that the Scottish Parliament has extended
                the non- statutory implementation of best value. Best value
                should encourage the continued development of partnerships with
                the community, voluntary and private sectors, where this adds to
                the overall efficiency, effectiveness, and economy of services.
                Best value practices should encourage the sharing of resources
                and information in appropriate cross-border partnerships.</p>
                <p>It is vital that best value practice does not become too
                mechanistic. It is vital that it be accompanied by a culture of
                workplace partnership and be related to human rights and
                equality issues — as I said earlier. It is my firm conviction
                that local government reform will set the context for local
                authorities’ powers and their limitations. It does not seem to
                be sensible, prudent, or even logical, to impose additional
                restrictions and structures in advance of this reform, given
                that local authorities are already implementing best value
                policies on a voluntary, non-statutory basis. It would be more
                appropriate to await the outcome of this reform before
                considering the legislative framework that may be required to
                foster local government practice in a spirit of the culture of
                best value.</p>
                <p>CCT legislation needs to be rescinded. However, the
                introduction of a detailed legislative scheme for best value
                should be deferred until local government reforms are being
                introduced. Until then, local authorities should continue to
                implement best value policies on a partnership and co-operative
                basis, and the legislative timetabling should reflect this
                flexible and phased approach. Go raibh míle maith agat.</p>
                <b>
                <p>Mr Ford:</p>
                </b>
                <p>The Minister, in outlining his proposals, told the House that
                there were two reasons why we required the Bill. The first was
                to get rid of compulsory competitive tendering (CCT); the second
                was because we need a statutory framework for best value. The
                first reason is self-evident, and it is not questioned by anyone
                in the Chamber. CCT has been an unmitigated disaster in its
                implementation in Northern Ireland. The very modest financial
                savings by district councils have been more than matched by
                consultants’ fees and staff time lost through pressures.
                However, the sweeping statement that we require a statutory
                framework for best value has not been spelt out in any detail.
                No reason has been adduced as to why a statutory framework is
                required.</p>
                <p>Can the Minister tell us why the Scots can manage for two
                more years without a statutory basis for best value, yet for our
                councils there is apparently an urgent requirement for
                back-to-back legislation to introduce statutory best value? It
                should be borne in mind that district councils in Northern
                Ireland account for less than 5% of all public expenditure and
                that they are in a completely different situation from that of
                the unitary authorities in Scotland, which have far greater
                powers.</p>
                <p>The reaction of councillors, in giving the proposals a
                general welcome, has also been cited. The Committee Chairperson
                has queried the numbers and the format involved in that. I
                suspect that district councillors who have not had the pleasure
                of being elected to the Assembly still think that the
                consultation process is as it has been for the last 30 years.
                They think that a consultation document is issued; district
                councils and others comment on it; the Civil Service ignores the
                comments; and an Order in Council goes through Westminster at
                midnight without any regard for what has been said.</p>
                <p>It would be an interesting exercise to remind district
                councillors that it is the Assembly that legislates and not
                Westminster — at least for another week anyway. On issues
                requiring consultation, they should know that there are open
                minds in the Assembly that will listen to the evidence — not
                closed minds that will slavishly follow whatever is being done
                in London, Edinburgh or Cardiff.</p>
                <p>There is no doubt that the Minister has outlined some
                significant points that need to be taken into account. We need
                much more transparency and accountability. We need to give local
                residents and ratepayers a say in how matters are dealt with in
                their districts. What the Minister proposes, however, is that
                the district auditor, who has functions in the field of
                accounts, should be able to report on other matters. An auditor,
                with his accounting background, may be qualified to judge
                matters of economy, efficiency and effectiveness. However, will
                the Minister explain how an auditor can judge when a swimming
                pool should be open, whether a district council should spend
                money on a children’s playground, or whether additional
                recycling centres should be maintained? Those are political
                issues on which councillors are entitled to set political
                priorities. They are not issues to be tied up purely on the
                basis of an auditor’s examination of best value.</p>
                <p>It is clear by the reaction to the draft Bill that was put
                before the Committee that this is a frightened rethink on the
                part of the Department and the Executive. Speaking as a Member
                of the Opposition, and given today’s reaction from leading
                figures in the DUP, SDLP and Sinn Féin, I am not surprised that
                the Executive are running scared. If members of their parties
                sit in the Chamber and query the legislative plans that the
                Executive put before us, they clearly have a great deal to be
                frightened about. It has been highlighted, for example, that the
                best value regime is now somewhat less prescriptive because we
                will no longer depend on subordinate legislation but on
                departmental circulars.</p>
                <p>Will the Minister explain how the Committee for the
                Environment will scrutinise the Executive’s proposals, which
                will come out in the form of a departmental circular? Will we
                have a full opportunity to discuss them? Will they be laid
                before the House as subordinate legislation would be? If not, we
                shall end up with a best value regime that is equally
                prescriptive but not subject to democratic scrutiny in the
                Assembly.</p>
                <p>If we are to talk about transparency and accountability, the
                Executive must clearly explain to the Assembly what is happening
                to the review of public administration. This issue is one of
                directing best value to councils alone. Where is the rest of the
                quango state? Where are all the agencies that look after what
                would be council functions if we were in England, Wales or
                Scotland? We cannot simply compare a body such as Moyle District
                Council with Glasgow City Council, Cardiff City Council or a
                London borough council. The population is minute by comparison,
                and the range of functions is totally restrictive. What we still
                have, although there are modest changes in the way that best
                value is to be administered, is the best value regime being
                introduced in England. That regime is being applied to a
                completely different set of circumstances in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p>The Department’s original proposals were like using a
                sledgehammer to crack a nut. We now have a heavy single-handed
                club hammer to crack a nut. My Colleagues and I shall seek to
                design a suitable nutcracker, both in Committee and when the
                Bill comes back to the Chamber, rather than use what the
                Government have suggested.</p>
                <b>
                <p>Mr S Wilson:</p>
                </b>
                <p>I endorse many of the remarks that have been made about the
                necessity to drive the legislation through as quickly as the
                Minister has suggested. I suspect that one of the reasons behind
                driving through quickly is that it will provide the Minister
                with an excuse for not including many of the concerns that
                people have, and many of the legitimate amendments that should
                be made to the legislation. It strikes me as odd that we have to
                rush the Bill through in Northern Ireland, when voluntary best
                value could be extended in Scotland for a period of time.</p>
                <p>I have served in local government for a long time, therefore
                I am not against local government being forced, and legislation
                being introduced, to ensure that ratepayers get good value for
                money.</p>
                <p>Many Members who have served on councils know that value for
                money is important because ratepayers are increasingly asking
                questions about the delivery, cost, quality and nature of
                services. Let nobody run away with the idea that asking for the
                legislation to be delayed is an excuse for not wanting value for
                money at local government level. Serious questions need to be
                raised about the legislation. However, I suspect that the
                impetus being applied by the Department will drive the
                legislation through.</p>
                <p>I wish to deal with two aspects of the legislation; one
                aspect is included in the legislation and the second is not.
                First, the Minister spoke about the need to make allowances for
                local variations. He referred to clause 2 (Best value guidance,
                performance indicators and standards) and said that he would
                establish a joint working group to make best use of the
                knowledge at local government level. The working group would
                advise the Department as to what should be contained in
                guidance.</p>
                <p>Looking at the record of the Minister and of the Department
                to date, I doubt very much if anyone will pay any attention to
                the working group. As mentioned earlier by Mr Ford, one change
                in the new legislation is that it will not allow for indicators
                to vary between councils. Allowance was made for that in the
                original legislation. The working group that was set up to look
                at the indicators recommended that there should be different
                indicators for different councils, given the diverse nature of
                some councils. One example is street cleaning in Belfast. It is
                unfair to impose an indicator of cost-per-head-of-population for
                street cleaning on a city that has so many daily visitors,
                whether they be tourists or workers. It does not make sense to
                apply the same indicator to Belfast as to a rural town that does
                not have the same numbers of visitors and therefore does not
                have the same street-cleaning problems.</p>
                <p>The original intention was to allow variations in indicators
                between councils. However, the Minister has removed that
                allowance, despite the fact that it was recommended by a working
                group that was made up of practitioners at local government
                level. If that is an example of how he intends to heed the views
                of local practitioners or the people who he says have knowledge
                of local government, we should be sceptical about his promise.</p>
                <p>When the Environment Committee goes through the legislation
                clause by clause, I hope members will re-examine clause 2(4) and
                ensure that the words</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p>&quot;different performance indicators or standards may be
                specified for different councils&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p>are reinstated. It is logical to include those words in the
                legislation. Having worked in local government, I know that if
                something is measured, it is likely to be done. I am in favour
                of indicators. Problems arise when a bad indicator is set and
                resources are pushed towards meeting that indicator; the
                exercise is futile and wasteful and does not give good value for
                money.</p>
                <p>My second point relates to something that is absent from the
                legislation here but is included in the legislation for the rest
                of the United Kingdom.</p>
                <p>Section 16 of the Local Government Act 1999 allows the
                Department to confer additional powers on councils so that they
                can enact best value. Those additional powers might change the
                way in which councils do things or they might allow councils to
                enter into partnerships. That is important.</p>
                <i>
                <p>11.45 am</p>
                </i>
                <p>Six pilot studies were carried out before best value
                legislation was introduced, and 75% of them showed that the
                authorities believed that partnership was important in their
                approach to best value. The team reported that partnerships
                enabled innovation in service delivery and made more effective
                use of existing resources.</p>
                <p>Despite the evidence from the pilot studies in England, the
                Minister has dismissed the inclusion of any clause enabling him
                to give additional powers to councils to let them have
                partnership arrangements if it was believed that they would lead
                to a more effective delivery of services. The Minister has made
                a number of arguments. He wrote to the Committee Chairperson
                with the usual &quot;I am committed to broader powers for local
                government, et cetera, et cetera.&quot; However, the first
                argument was that this legislation must go through. One reason
                why the Department wishes the legislation to go through is that
                it will allow the Department to avoid having to look at whether
                or not to give those additional powers to local authorities.</p>
                <p>During my time in local government, I learned that the local
                government branch of the Department of the Environment wants
                very little to do with local government; it certainly does not
                want local government to have too much power. I suspect that
                there is an element of in-house fighting going on.</p>
                <p>The Minister did not believe that the councils were large
                enough to benefit from partnerships. However, the joining of
                three bodies — the councils that joined together to look at
                waste management — has shown that it is possible for
                partnerships to be effective.</p>
                <p>As long ago as 1997 — I remember this because I was
                involved through Belfast City Council — Lord Dubs promised to
                look at the possibility of allowing councils to enter into
                partnerships for economic development purposes. Yet, here we are
                four years later, and nothing has been done about that. Lord
                Dubs has gone; there is a new Minister; and we are still getting
                the same promises.</p>
                <p>For the Minister to say that he is looking at ways of
                enhancing the powers of local government but that consultation
                will be required is an excuse. The Local Government Act 1999
                allows for scrutiny when a council asks for those extra powers,
                and that means that the process does not need to be delayed any
                further.</p>
                <p>The Minister says that he does not believe that partnerships
                are critical to the early success of best value. That is bizarre
                considering that 75% of the councils involved in the initial
                pilot studies said that that was the case. Surely the Minister
                has to give cognisance to the evidence from local government
                where best value has been practised and partnerships have been
                used.</p>
                <p>The Minister should respond to the first position adopted by
                the Committee, that the legislation should not be pushed
                through. There is no need for haste.</p>
                <p>If the Department insists that the legislation come before
                the Assembly, it could be voted down. If that does not happen,
                then it is important that the legislation be amended to change
                clause 2 to allow individual performance indicators for
                different councils. Belfast could have a performance indicator
                that is the same as those used in medium-sized cities in other
                parts of the UK. That would be reasonable.</p>
                <p>A clause should be inserted to allow additional powers to be
                given to individual or groups of local authorities. Additional
                powers are believed to lead to a more efficient use of resources
                when entering into partnership with other bodies or with the
                private sector. This would lead to a council’s achieving best
                value objectives.</p>
                <p>Unlike the situation under direct rule, we can look at flaws
                in the legislation. This is the view that has come from the
                practitioners, the people who have to implement the legislation.
                The Minister ought to use the evidence that is coming from the
                Environment Committee, local government and Members of the
                Assembly to see the folly contained in the Bill as it presently
                stands and remedy it.</p>
                <b>
                <p>Mr ONeill:</p>
                </b>
                <p>The thought of getting rid of compulsory competitive
                tendering is wonderful to me. The depredation that the policy
                has wreaked on councils and the delivery of public services is
                sufficient to encourage me to support the legislation.</p>
                <p>I am convinced that the concept of best value, if not always
                its practice, emphasises, reinforces and values public service.
                This is something that was vilified by previous Administrations
                in England and led to the introduction of compulsory competitive
                tendering.</p>
                <p>Public service is, and could be in the future, excellent.
                However I am amazed at the approach, not just by the Minister
                and his Department, but by the entire Executive towards best
                value. Why does it apply only to councils? If we look at the
                concept of best value and at the statistics that the Assembly
                Research and Library Service can provide, we see that the
                estimated net expenditure by councils in 2000-01 amounted to
                £275 million, out of a total Northern Ireland public
                expenditure of £9·9 billion. This is approximately 2·8%, even
                lower than the figure of 5% that Mr Ford referred to.</p>
                <p>There are 148 other public bodies operating in Northern
                Ireland that are run by 2,000 appointees. There are 46 executive
                non-departmental public bodies and 32 National Health Service
                bodies with an expenditure of £5·5 billion, approximately 56%
                of public expenditure. Nothing is being done about best value in
                that sector. Why should Departments escape the discipline and
                rigour of best value? They are responsible for the rest of the
                expenditure. If we look at best value and its introduction into
                the Administration in Northern Ireland, 2·8% of that
                expenditure is hardly exciting.</p>
                <p>I am not a member of the Environment Committee, so there are
                a number of points that I would like the Committee and the
                Department to examine. First, on page 1 of the Bill, clause 1(1)
                (The duty of best value) refers to the three Es — economy,
                efficiency and effectiveness. Although there are differences
                between local government in Britain and in Northern Ireland, we
                can learn from the experience of the operation of best value
                there.</p>
                <p>Economy, efficiency and effectiveness are good things, but
                they apply principally to finance. There is little emphasis on
                the human element, or on delivery to the population. Now,
                instead of three Es, we talk about five Es: economy, efficiency,
                effectiveness, equality, and environment. This is often referred
                to as the well-being factor, as it addresses the well-being of
                the community and not just the monetary aspect of best value. I
                would like to see that emphasis included in the amended
                legislation.</p>
                <p>Mr Wilson referred to clause 2(1) of the Bill. The
                introduction to that clause reads</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p>&quot;The Department may issue guidance to councils as to the
                carrying out of their functions under this Act.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p>Although it is hinted at, nowhere does it actually say that
                there should be consultation with the people involved. An
                amendment should be included to emphasise that the Department
                may issue the guidelines as to carrying out of their functions
                under the Act, &quot;following full and detailed consultation
                and agreement with all stakeholders&quot;. I am suggesting an
                emphasis on the well-being factor. It would not be a big job for
                the Department to discover who its stakeholders are — they are
                councils, community groups and various other people. Departments
                could quickly investigate that through an audit.</p>

                </b>
                <p>I agree with the Member’s point. Clause 2(5) states</p>

                <p>&quot;Before specifying performance indicators or standards,

                <p>Mr ONeill:</p>
                </b>
                <p>I was referring to clause 2(1). Mr Wilson is referring to a
                clause that is specifically on performance indicators.
                Consultation should apply to the whole operation of the
                introduction of best value.</p>
                <p>In addition, I refer to clause 3(4)(b), where there is a
                requirement for inspection in circumstances indicated in the
                Act. It would be sensible, fair and wise to have a specified
                date for the inspection to be carried out. Such a date could be
                chosen to allow local authorities time to compile a full annual
                report.</p>
                <p>A date such as the end of June would give councils an
                opportunity to compile that report and help people adjust to the
                requirements of the Act.</p>
                <i>
                <p>12.00</p>
                </i>
                <p>Finally, I refer to section 16 of the Local Government Act
                1999, which Mr S Wilson has already mentioned. I emphasise again
                that the experience in Britain has been good. In fact, I
                understand that Nick Raynsford has agreed for work to be done on
                that sector to improve the regulations under section 16. The
                well-being concept and partnerships have been highlighted. Mr S
                Wilson made the arguments very well, and I do not need to
                reiterate them. Among the regulations is a new power to provide
                indemnities to members and officers involved in partnerships and
                external bodies.</p>
                <p>While we have had bad experiences here, the ravages of
                compulsory competitive tendering in England have produced some
                frightful cases. I read recently about an employee who has five
                pensions because he was shoved around from one private
                contractor to another. He has lost all the stability and
                security that he had as a council employee.</p>
                <p>In addition to the partnership emphasis, section 16 helps to
                ensure that employees are safeguarded and that their benefits
                and job standards are not lost or interfered with through any of
                the partnerships or public-private deals that might be made. It
                is, and should be, an area of great concern to us as we embark
                on a best value approach. We should learn from what has happened
                in England in that regard and be very wary of the damage that
                could be done to individuals.</p>
                <b>
                <p>The Minister of the Environment (Mr Foster):</p>
                </b>
                <p>&nbsp;I thank the Members who contributed to the debate.
                There is, undoubtedly, a keen interest in this matter. Members
                have dwelt upon the issue and looked into it, and it is right
                and proper that it should be debated thoroughly. The responses
                mirror the genuine interest shown in the earlier consultation
                process, which sought to deliver best value in the interests of
                council residents and district ratepayers.</p>
                <p>I have listened to the debate carefully and I will try to
                reply to as many points as possible in the time available. My
                officials will, in any case, scrutinise Hansard, and I will
                write to those Members who raised issues that require further
                clarification.</p>
                <p>Rev William McCrea asked why we need legislation if councils
                have already introduced best value voluntarily. First, the
                requirement for compulsory competitive tendering (CCT) has
                merely been deferred using subordinate legislation that remains
                on the statute book and cannot be deferred further. That means
                that the CCT obligation becomes effective again on 1 April 2002
                unless the legislation is repealed before that date. Secondly,
                experience of voluntary implementation of best value to date
                indicates that a statutory framework is essential if we are to
                deliver transparency, accountability and consistency.</p>
                <p>Should best value legislation be deferred pending the review
                of local government? In accordance with the Programme for
                Government, the Executive are committed to a full review of
                public administration, including the administration of local and
                public services. I have been pushing for that for quite a while
                but other events have taken over. However, best value principles
                apply irrespective of the structure and responsibilities of
                local government. I therefore see no need to defer the
                introduction of best value legislation on those grounds.</p>
                <p>Why the urgency with the Local Government (Best Value) Bill?
                Why does the Minister not simply defer it? That approach has
                been used in Scotland, where a moratorium has been placed on CCT
                pending the development of appropriate best value legislation.
                However, it is not possible in Northern Ireland, where a
                different legislative framework exists. The Department has
                already used subordinate legislation to defer the implementation
                of CCT, but it is still enshrined in primary legislation. Legal
                advice indicates that further deferral in this way is not
                viable.</p>
                <p>Should the Bill deal with the repeal of CCT alone, leaving
                the framework of best value to be formulated by the Department
                and local government at a later date? That is a good question;
                indeed, there were several good questions. The clear objective
                underpinning best value is that it is a policy designed with the
                interests of residents and ratepayers at heart. If we are to
                deliver the transparency and accountability, which local people
                deserve, while ensuring consistency of approach, experience to
                date of voluntary implementation of best value indicates that
                the framework needs to be clearly defined in legislation. That
                is vitally important. As drafted, the Bill would allow local
                people to have their say on the levels and standards of service
                provision in their areas.</p>
                <p>Rev William McCrea also asked if all councils were happy with
                the redrafting of the Bill. The draft Bill has been circulated
                to all councils, and they have not advised me of any particular
                problems. That does not surprise me, as the redrafted Bill
                addresses their key concerns.</p>
                <p>Mr Doherty asked why the Bill did not apply to Government
                Departments. I contend that central Government already operates
                under a value-for-money or best value framework. Elements of
                that include a Government accounting manual and accompanying
                financial regulations; a requirement to operate resource
                accounting and budgeting; a detailed Programme for Government
                incorporating departmental public service agreements, corporate
                and business plans, internal scrutiny and Northern Ireland Audit
                Office scrutiny, and the Public Accounts Committee of the
                Assembly. I assure the Member that we are very well scrutinised.</p>
                <p>Mr Doherty also asked if best value would concern process at
                the expense of outcome. That issue was highlighted during the
                consultation process, and I am anxious to ensure that it will
                not occur. At the same time, councils expressed a need for
                guidance concerning best value.</p>
                <p>Mr Doherty wanted to know why the Department had not
                conducted an equality impact assessment of draft best value
                legislation. My officials have closely screened the proposed
                policy and have identified no issues of concern on equality
                grounds. A decision not to undertake a full equality impact
                assessment was ratified with the Equality Commission. Under
                section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, councils are
                required to produce equality schemes for approval by the
                Equality Commission. Councils will therefore have a legal
                obligation to operate best value within the parameters of their
                approved schemes.</p>
                <p>Mr McLaughlin referred to support for the partnership
                approach. I have already advised his party that we have delayed
                the introduction of this legislation pending local government
                reform. Mr Ford asked why we need a statutory framework for CCT,
                and why we do not adopt the Scottish approach. I referred
                earlier to the Scottish approach and to our legal difficulties.
                Is it true to say that the Department has ignored the concerns
                of councils and the Environment Committee in bringing forward
                the draft Bill? I assure the Member that that is definitely not
                the case — we do not do business like that. We want to work
                with people and we co-operate with people. I refute any
                suggestion that my staff override any Department or area. The
                draft legislation was subject to an extended consultation
                process. My officials and I met the Environment Committee to
                discuss the draft proposals. That approach proved most useful
                and led me to instruct my officials to redraft the legislation
                and address many of the concerns expressed at that time. In
                particular, there was a genuine concern that my Department would
                use subordinate legislation to establish a framework that placed
                more emphasis on process than on outcomes. We have examined that
                issue and dealt with it; we do not want to override anyone’s
                responsibility.</p>
                <p>Mr Sammy Wilson made a number of points. He referred to
                individual performance indicators, which are not appropriate to
                all councils. He asked why councils do not have the freedom to
                set their own performance indicators. I see clear merits in
                having a set of four indicators, which are used by all councils,
                instilling some consistency across local government. However, I
                recognise that individual performance indicators will not be
                equally relevant to each council. No indicator, taken in
                isolation, can accurately measure the performance of a council.
                We need benchmarks, and that is why we seek them. I therefore
                expect councils to supplement cross- council indicators with
                local indicators, which they will develop themselves to reflect
                local circumstances. The joint use of cross-council and local
                indicators should prove an effective means of summarising
                council performance.</p>
                <p>Mr Sammy Wilson also asked whether the Department would
                genuinely listen to local government when producing guidance. I
                have assured the Assembly that the Department collaborates with
                the Environment Committee and all relevant agencies and groups
                to ensure that we are working together for the common good.</p>
                <p>I emphasise that my record shows that my officials have
                worked positively with council officials and I refute the
                suggestion that we are not working in co- operation with others
                or discussing matters with them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Great Britain’s legislation gives the
                Secretary of State the power to amend or remove the legislative
                barriers to achieving best value. Mr Sammy Wilson asked why
                those powers were not replicated in the Local Government (Best
                Value) Bill. As in Great Britain, certain legislative barriers
                to best value might become apparent over time. Any legislation
                that could impede the full implementation of best value would
                need to be examined and discussed, in the first instance, with
                the appropriate Department. If a decision were reached to change
                existing provision the relevant Department would be responsible
                for any amending legislation, which would be channelled through
                the normal legislative process.</p>
                <p>Mr Sammy Wilson asked about economic development powers, a
                matter that has been referred to many times in my years as a
                councillor. The issue has cross-cutting implications for many
                Departments; it will be addressed in due course through
                interdepartmental discussion. However, the matter should not be
                allowed to delay the progress of the important task of
                establishing a sound framework for best value.</p>
                <p>Mr ONeill welcomed the demise of CCT, and asked whether the
                statutes of guidance would be subject to consultation. I have
                responded to that point and his question on whether we could
                draw on the English experience.</p>
                <p>I assure the House that I do not wish to be over-
                prescriptive in regard to best value. I recognise that best
                value touches all aspects of local services; none is more
                important than the well-being of local communities. I have every
                confidence that councils will continue to address that issue
                within the best value framework.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the Minister responsible for local
                government in Northern Ireland, I consider it my duty to further
                promote transparency and accountability in the use of council
                resources and the provision of local services. In bringing the
                Local Government (Best Value) Bill to the Assembly, I sought to
                achieve that objective. I listened carefully, therefore, to all
                of the representations, and I thanked everyone who contributed
                to the consultation process. It is true that concerns were
                expressed about the labour-intensive nature of best value and
                about the apparent emphasis on procedures rather than outcomes.</p>

                late to get rid of CCT by next April; therefore, we would be

                points and concerns expressed. I want the Bill to proceed. I am
                not trying to push something through against anyone’s will.
                However, while some negative points have been made, not
                everybody has said that they do not want the Local Government
                (Best Value) Bill. Members are concerned and have questioned
                some points, but, in the main, they welcome the Bill. I would
                not therefore give way on that point.</p>
                <p>Many people support the provision of greater guidance to help
                streamline processes, provided that allowance is made to
                accommodate the diversity of circumstances among councils. There
                was uniform agreement that CCT should be replaced, with greater
                emphasis on quality service delivery rather than the lowest-cost
                option.</p>
                <i>

                </i>
                <p>It was also widely recognised that in order to achieve
                quality services a framework for best value — which I still
                contend is necessary — must be developed to engage local
                people in meaningful consultation. I have fully considered all
                of these matters; we need a common statutory framework to ensure
                that people in different council areas have equal opportunity to
                participate in local services provision and to obtain quality
                local services. Again, such a framework must be transparent,
                consistent and accountable to ratepayers and users of local
                public services. The framework should provide a basis for local
                people and councils to work in partnership with each other. The
                framework has to be workable and proportionate to the
                requirements and circumstances of district councils. That is why
                I have made provision in the Bill for my Department to develop
                further guidance on partnership with local government. The
                guidance should benefit councils in their implementation of best
                value by providing the necessary consistency of approach and
                enabling councils to learn from one another. It is important
                that we have benchmarks and that we learn from one another.</p>
                <p>In the Local Government (Best Value) Bill I have responded to
                the representations made to me. I firmly believe that the Bill
                makes provision for the framework that I described. The Bill is
                proportionate to the needs of local government in Northern
                Ireland and, at the same time, it addresses the needs of
                residents and ratepayers, giving them the assurances that they
                require. The Bill needs to proceed, and, although I understand
                everything that was said, I know that not everyone is against
                the Bill because we have discussed and co-ordinated the matter
                across the realm. I commend the Local Government (Best Value)
                Bill to the Assembly.</p>

                <p>That this Assembly views with concern the ever-increasing
                waiting lists for medical and hospital treatment in our local
                health services, and requires immediate action to remedy this
                unacceptable and growing problem.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p>One of the most urgent issues facing the Assembly, which acts
                on behalf of the community, is the spiralling increase in
                waiting lists for medical and hospital treatment and the
                consequential increase in waiting lists for all types of health
                care, including community care.</p>
                <p>I — and, no doubt, others — will quote many statistics
                today. Behind those statistics is a huge amount of human
                suffering and misery. Waiting for surgical appointments means
                additional suffering, and that should be and can be avoided. In
                some cases, waiting leads to premature death, and society should
                strive with all its might to eradicate death and suffering. That
                is what health care is all about.</p>
                <p>There are continual stories and statistics in the press about
                the rise in waiting lists. In September 2000, we were told that
                the waiting lists in Northern Ireland were the longest in the
                UK. In November, we were told that one of the reasons that the
                waiting lists were extended was that one plastic surgeon in the
                Royal Victoria Hospital could not be replaced. As a consequence,
                waiting time for plastic surgery increased to two years for
                elective surgery. Such is the fragility of the current system.</p>
                <p>As the Minister said at Question Time yesterday, the
                quarterly figure for ordinary and day-case admissions stands at
                a massive 54,246 — and that includes elective and non-elective
                admissions. In the quarter from March to June of this year, the
                waiting list increased by 2,251 — a 4·3% increase. Examined
                from a different angle, the figure for those ordinary and
                day-case admissions from June 2000 to June 2001 rocketed by a
                massive 4,728, to 54,246.</p>
                <p>Last Tuesday, a news item referred to Northern Ireland’s
                chronic nursing shortage, which has caused the closure of 55
                beds in the Royal Victoria Hospital and has doubtless
                contributed to the waiting list. The issue is not simply the
                number of surgical procedures performed, it concerns capital
                back-up, existing facilities and time.</p>
                <p>For example, according to the Eastern Health and Social
                Services Council, 93 patients in Northern Ireland waited more
                than seven days for emergency repair to hip fractures. Medical
                guidelines state that the waiting time for such treatment should
                be no more than 24 hours. Yet, not just one or two people, but
                93 people waited seven days for treatment.</p>
                <p>The Acute Hospitals Review Group has published the most
                up-to-date, analytical, independent report into the issue, and
                it is entirely divorced from departmental figures. Indeed, the
                Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety appointed
                that review group, which provided startling statistics about
                hospital and medical waiting lists in June 2001. On page 20, at
                paragraph&nbsp;3.9, it states:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p>&quot; Northern Ireland has the longest per capita hospital
                waiting lists in the UK. In March 2000 there were over 47,000
                people waiting for elective treatment, an increase of nearly
                11,000 compared to March 1996. More significantly, there has
                been a huge increase in waiting <i>times, </i>with the number of
                patients waiting 18 months or more for treatment increasing from
                632 in March 1996 to 5,200 in March 2000.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p>The Hayes report refers to the rising numbers on waiting
                lists for outpatient departments:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p>&quot;the number of people recorded as waiting for an
                outpatient appointment has increased significantly from 59,000
                in March 1996 to over 102,000 in March 2000.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p>Yesterday, the Minister told the House that that figure had
                risen to 128,438. Should we not be anxious about those figures?
                There is something wrong with a society that cannot focus on
                such a massive failure to provide normal public health care. The
                report continues:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p>&quot;Of these patients, the number waiting six months or
                more for an appointment has increased from 7,300 to over
                26,700.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p>Those are frightening figures. Supplementary material to the
                Minister’s oral answers, available in the Assembly Library,
                shows that 498 people are waiting for cardiac bypass surgery in
                the Eastern Health and Social Services Board area; of those, 63
                have been waiting for six to eight months. There is a waiting
                list of 1,385 people for hernia operations; of those, 810 have
                been waiting, in much discomfort, for more than two months.
                There is a waiting list of 638 people for knee replacement
                operations; of those, 118 have waited for six to eight months.</p>
                <p>Considering the size of the population and the number of
                hospitals in Northern Ireland, the average waiting time for
                specific operations such as cataract removal, heart bypass
                surgery, hernia repair and knee replacements is longer than in
                England, Scotland or Wales.</p>
                <p>The despair engendered by such a long waiting list is
                obvious, and I see it in my constituency surgery. It increases
                day by day. A Rostrevor constituent has been on the urgent
                cardiac bypass list for 13 months. Another constituent, from
                Downpatrick, has been waiting for over two years for quadruple
                bypass surgery. Recently, a consultant told him that surgical
                slots had been reduced by 50%. The average waiting time for
                cardiac bypass surgery is two years. Earlier this year, I
                visited an elderly woman in Mayobridge who has a chronic hip
                condition and has been waiting for over two years for a hip
                replacement. An Annalong constituent has been waiting for a lung
                transplant for two years, even though he has a donor who has
                been medically approved. The consultant cannot give him a date
                for the transplant surgery because he has been given no surgical
                slots for September. We are talking about human suffering.</p>

                <p>Mr McGrady:</p>
                </b>
                <p>I have concentrated on my constituency, but every Member
                could tell horrific stories of unnecessary human suffering.</p>
                <p>Since the introduction of devolution, there has been a
                concentration on deficits, underfunding and the need for
                adequate capital revenue expenditure on health. Substantive
                additional allocations have been made. I am grateful to the
                Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety for
                finding the time to be present at today’s debate. I ask her to
                respond to the growing problem of waiting lists. She may say
                that the problem could be solved by additional financial
                investment in the health service, despite the fact that there
                has been substantial additional funding. The amounts were £3
                million last year and £8 million this year. We are entitled to
                ask how the additional money has been used and managed, and what
                changes to the waiting lists have been brought about by it.</p>
                <p>At Question Time yesterday, the Minister again identified
                under-resourcing and overall capacity problems as the main
                factors contributing to the lengthening waiting lists. Have the
                Minister’s officials sought, or thought about, other ways of
                improving the position? For example, has consideration been
                given — I am not making a political point — to further
                cross-border co-operation? Hospital waiting lists in the
                Republic of Ireland have decreased in the past year. A news
                report that I saw in April showed that waiting lists in the
                Republic of Ireland had decreased by 9,000 patients. That means
                that there is a capacity there that we should be able to buy
                into.</p>
                <p>What consideration have the Minister and the Department given
                to the reversal of the political dogma of centralisation? Why
                not decentralise surgical procedures and use hospitals in the
                more rural areas — or not so rural areas — where surgical
                expertise still exists, before it is lost altogether? On 11
                September, the Minister referred to the work already undertaken
                to address the waiting list problems. What was the outcome of
                the ‘Framework for Action on Waiting Lists’, policy that was
                announced last autumn? What significant changes have taken place
                in the past 10&nbsp;months? In a press release of the same date
                — I am sorry to quote her, but she is the authority on, and
                has responsibility for, our health care — she said that:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p>&quot;the only long-term solution is money.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p>As a layperson, I disagree with that analysis. Certainly,
                extra money is essential, and it must be provided. However, is
                the money given to the Department of Health, Social Services and
                Public Safety — especially that given specifically for
                reducing waiting lists — managed effectively? The Minister
                should examine such issues, instead of simply saying that money
                is the solution to everything.</p>
                <p>The lack of resources has been referred to by the Minister,
                by the Assembly’s Health Committee on 2 July, and by the
                Eastern Health and Social Services Council on 12&nbsp;September.
                However, the debate about the lack of resources should not
                detract from the need for the Department to manage the current
                health budget more professionally and to deploy resources more
                effectively than at present. Some trusts are allowed to run up
                deficits while those that manage budgets properly suffer as a
                consequence. Residents in those trust areas have a diminished
                health service.</p>
                <p>It is also interesting to note what Dr Hayes and his
                committee said about waiting lists:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p>&quot;While undoubtedly there is a need for a substantial
                injection of funding, it is of even greater importance that
                existing resources are used as effectively as possible.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p>The report also states:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p>&quot;It is difficult to argue for additional resources for
                hospital and community health services against other national
                and regional priorities if we cannot also demonstrate that
                existing resources are being used to the best effect by
                generally accepted levels of comparison.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p>I must emphasise that point. An independent report is saying
                that there must be a clear demonstration that existing funding
                is being used effectively.</p>
                <i>
                <p>2.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p>The Hayes team demonstrated that spending on acute services
                in Northern Ireland was higher than in any other region in the
                British Isles, apart from Scotland in this particular instance.
                Another study of comparative waiting times for elective surgery
                demonstrated that the problem of lengthy waiting times had not
                even been targeted in Northern Ireland and that an initiative to
                tackle the problem was urgently required. The report also stated
                that Northern Ireland had more acute beds and staff per capita
                than many regions of England. Up to 10% or 15% of acute beds
                could be unavailable due to bed blocking caused by their use as
                follow-on accommodation for patients waiting to be transferred
                from residential to community care.</p>
                <p>The time is now ripe for the Department to address urgently
                the problem of hospital waiting lists. It is clear from recent
                newspaper coverage, questions posed in the Assembly, and
                contributions made this morning and on the radio that people are
                anxious about what is happening to their health service.
                Everyone has experienced in some way the dire consequences of
                extended waiting lists. The problem is creating unnecessary pain
                and suffering for many in our community. I submit the motion to
                the Assembly for its consideration; we should not allow that
                situation to continue.</p>

                <p>Madam Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p>Given the large number of Members who have asked to speak,
                and the high level of interest in the matter, Members should
                limit their contributions to five minutes.</p>

                <p>The Chairperson of the Committee for Health, Social Services
                and Public Safety (Dr Hendron):</p>
                </b>
                <p>I could not possibly cover the main points in five minutes,
                but I understand the restriction. I congratulate Mr McGrady on
                bringing such an important motion to the House, and I thank the
                Minister for her presence.</p>
                <p>Mr McGrady mentioned waiting lists and waiting times. Waiting
                times are a far more accurate means of measuring delay in the
                delivery of health care. People — in some cases, those with
                cancer — can wait long periods before getting an appointment
                with a consultant. We are all aware of the importance of early
                diagnosis and proper treatment, a massive subject in Northern
                Ireland today. I therefore draw the Minister’s attention to
                waiting times, as opposed to waiting lists.</p>
                <p>Some things are being done, and I appreciate that money has
                been spent and that several projects are under way. For example,
                lower back pain, one of the most common cases for referral in
                the primary care sector, can be caused by muscular problems
                rather than secondary cancer. Next month, a clinic will open at
                Musgrave Park Hospital at which physiotherapists will play a key
                role — and rightly so. Doctors in the Eastern Board area can
                refer patients to the clinic, rather than to an orthopaedic
                surgeon. Unfortunately, I do not have enough time to elaborate
                on that point.</p>
                <p>Similarly, if there is the slightest chance that a patient’s
                chest pain is caused by problems with a coronary artery there
                must be a diagnosis and, if necessary, treatment. However, a
                good deal of chest pain is caused by other factors. The Royal
                Hospital Group has, therefore, set up a clinic to which a
                patient can be sent if his doctor concludes that he is unlikely
                to be suffering from ischaemic heart disease. Skin cancer is
                another common illness in Northern Ireland, and a clinic at
                Belfast City Hospital treats patients affected by that disease.</p>
                <p>I appreciate that the Minister has made a bid for £122
                million for next year. However, the Health Committee fears that,
                if the full allocation is not made, the waiting lists will get
                worse. That point needs to be addressed by the Executive.
                Elderly people who live at home but who require residential care
                or increased packages of care are affected by waiting lists.
                Massive waiting lists also affect the professions allied to
                medicine, including occupational therapists, chiropodists, and
                speech and language therapists.</p>
                <p>Trusts will have to overspend dramatically, because boards
                and fundholders cannot provide enough funding to cover demand.
                Unsurprisingly, elective procedures will be the first to be
                affected, and there will be an obvious impact on waiting lists.
                For every pound that is now spent on the National Health Service
                in England, the equivalent in Northern Ireland is 75p.</p>
                <p>On 31 July in the Eastern Health and Social Services Board
                area alone, there were approximately 22,000 people on waiting
                lists for elective surgery. Of those, 3,600 had been on the
                lists for longer than the charter time limit.</p>
                <p>Orthopaedic surgery is a major problem in Northern Ireland.
                The elective orthopaedic service at Musgrave Park Hospital is
                reaching a crisis, and patients are now waiting for up to three
                years for some operations. Even waiting for an outpatient
                appointment to see a specialist orthopaedic surgeon can take up
                to three years. The current fracture crisis has caused the
                Department and area boards to concentrate on trauma problems.
                Although that is necessary, the elective service has been
                allowed to deteriorate, storing up a crisis in waiting times.
                Musgrave Park Hospital has been asked to help in operations on
                trauma cases, which the hospital has been able to do without
                cancelling other operations.</p>
                <p>There is a massive problem; orthopaedic surgery could be the
                subject of a debate on its own. As Mr McGrady mentioned, people
                with fractured femurs at Craigavon Area Hospital and Antrim
                Hospital have had to wait for a week; 24 hours is the stipulated
                waiting time.</p>
                <p>What can we do about it? I will not talk about finances; I
                accept that we need more money, but there is more to it than
                that. It is important how the resources are used. In her
                statement on 11 September, the Minister said:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p>&quot;the increases [in waiting lists] highlight the fact
                that, without major new investment, our hospital and community
                care services simply cannot cope with the present, growing
                levels of demand.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p>We agree with that. The Minister also said:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p>&quot;all boards and trusts are working on measures at the
                moment to improve efficiencies in the system.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p>For goodness’ sake, let us look at the system. That is
                where the problems are. There are 19 trusts for a population the
                size of Greater Birmingham — I say that with respect to the
                Minister. We must look at the trusts. If Sir Reg Empey can merge
                LEDU and IDB without waiting for a review of public
                administration, there is no reason why we cannot examine the
                whole structure of the Health Service. Primary care can be
                talked about another day.</p>
                <b>
                <p>Madam Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p>I thank Dr Hendron for his understanding of the time
                constraints. Fifteen Members have asked to speak, and we want to
                allow them all the opportunity to do so.</p>
                <b>
                <p>Dr Adamson:</p>
                </b>
                <p>I also thank Mr McGrady for bringing this motion before the
                House; as he said, it is extremely important. The agreement of
                the Department of Health in England to allow health authorities
                there to commission services from other European countries was
                prompted by a ruling by the European Court of Justice. It stated
                that patients facing an &quot;undue delay&quot; in treatment in
                their country should seek earlier treatment in other European
                countries. That means that the door is now open for a
                significant reduction in the waiting lists in England for
                cardiac surgery, hip and knee replacements, cataract surgery and
                an increasing variety of other elective procedures. The decision
                of the Secretary of State to allow individuals to make their own
                arrangements to be treated in Europe at the expense of the
                National Health Service may also, I hope, prevent the
                development of a massive bureaucratic network to facilitate that
                extension of the service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGrady and Dr Hendron have shown that, as
                most of the progressive countries in the European Union operate
                without waiting lists, it would not be hard to prove &quot;undue
                delay&quot; in Northern Ireland. We have the worst waiting lists
                of any of the four countries of the United&nbsp;Kingdom, yet
                fundholders in Northern Ireland have shown that it is possible
                to buy cost-effective services in England and Scotland, despite
                their own waiting list problems. Patients generally show a
                willingness to travel rather than wait indefinitely for
                treatment, and the quality of clinical outcomes is at least
                equivalent to the quality of service achieved locally. Some
                health boards have used the facilities of the Blackrock Clinic
                in Dublin with similar success.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People in Northern Ireland are entitled to
                treatment equal to that available in other parts of the United
                Kingdom. Some people feel that when resources move away it
                undermines the ability to provide quality services in Northern
                Ireland. Reliable, guaranteed funding is needed so that we can
                retain staff with the required skills and ensure that those
                skills are kept up to date. On the other hand, some feel that a
                lack of competition creates complacency. Cardiac surgical
                services have had guaranteed resources. However, the standard of
                performance is clearly damaging patients in our Province. There
                is probably an element of truth in both those arguments. The
                fundamental aim of the Health Service should be to meet the
                needs of the population, and we are not doing that at present.
                Action must be taken both in the short and longer terms.</p>
                <p>In the rest of the National Health Service there has been a
                considerable injection of cash as part of the modernisation
                process. The NHS plans to achieve parity with European health
                funding over the next five years. However, the Health Service in
                Northern Ireland has been demonstrably unable to attract similar
                injections of cash. We have, therefore, been given an
                opportunity to redress the balance in a way that would benefit
                patients immensely. We must always remember that if treatment
                were more timely, there would be fewer lost working days and
                benefit claims, and that would be a positive boost to the local
                economy.</p>
                <p>In the longer term, we can consider how to handle existing
                resources and any increase that we might receive. Like many of
                my medical colleagues, I believe that using services from other
                EU countries is an interesting idea and takes us away from the
                parochial thinking that affects so much of life in Northern
                Ireland. Are we not all Europeans now? Can we not show the rest
                of the community that we are equal to the task?</p>
                <b>
                <p>Mr Berry:</p>
                </b>
                <p>I commend Mr McGrady for tabling the motion. It has given us
                an opportunity to highlight the serious problem of waiting
                lists.</p>
                <p>The whole Health Service in Northern Ireland is in disarray.
                Regrettably, it does not seem to be dealing with the problem of
                waiting lists. We listened to Mr McGrady talk about his
                constituents, who have been waiting for operations for over two
                years. The Chairman of the Health Committee was just warming to
                the subject of what is needed to deal with the problem.</p>
                <p>The waiting lists will get worse if sufficient funding is not
                found. It is regrettable that the Department’s bid for an
                extra £122 million for next year has no guarantee of being met.
                It will merely maintain the status quo. Not only is funding
                needed but, as the Chairman of the Health Committee said we must
                examine the whole structure of the Health Service. It is
                disgraceful that there are 19 trusts and four boards. The
                problem with the Health Service in Northern Ireland is that
                there are far too many chiefs and too much bureaucracy. Our
                constituents are not being treated fairly.</p>
                <p>In Craigavon Area Hospital and Daisy Hill Hospital 42
                patients were waiting in the accident and emergency departments.
                Over two thirds were waiting for a bed to become available
                before they could be admitted to a hospital ward. Patients were
                waiting in the corridors. I went to Craigavon Area Hospital the
                other night at 10.30 to speak to a constituent who had been
                waiting for over a week for an operation and was still lying on
                a bed in the corridor. Her privacy had been taken away. It was
                ridiculous. That hospital was like something in a Third- World
                country. It is not just Craigavon Area Hospital; it is a
                Province-wide problem. The situation should be dealt with. It is
                distressing for patients and their families. Patients’ charter
                standards are not being met, and urgent action is required from
                the Minister.</p>
                <i>
                <p>2.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p>We need more consultants, nurses and medical staff. If that
                need is not met, there will be severe problems ahead. In 1998,we
                had a document entitled ‘Fit for the Future’. It recommended
                that we abolish boards and merge the trusts. Then we had ‘Fit
                for the Future — A New Approach’, which advocated merging
                trusts and increasing the role of general practitioners. Then we
                had a document titled ‘Putting It Right’. The next thing at
                our door was the Hayes report, which contains a lot of
                recommendations. The Hayes report says that from now until 2010
                we will need 400 more consultants, which will cost £40 million
                per annum; 250 more general practitioners, which will cost
                another £25 million; and 2,300 additional nurses — an
                increase of 20% — which will cost £60 million per annum.</p>
                <p>There is no way in which we can meet such costs, and we can
                start to deal with the problem only if we have more funding. We
                must call upon the Chancellor of the Exchequer to examine the
                funding of the Health Service in Northern Ireland. There is no
                doubt about it — we are underfunded. That must be addressed,
                so that the Department can deal with the problems it faces. The
                Department has a responsibility to the people of Northern
                Ireland, especially those who are waiting for surgery. Health
                Service structures must be examined immediately, so that there
                is less bureaucracy and more work is done for all patients in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland, no matter what their postcode is.</p>
                <p>It is distressing to walk into hospitals in a so-called
                modern society and see people lying on beds in corridors. One
                lady waited for heart surgery for over a year. During that time,
                she suffered another heart attack and had to go through the
                whole system again, just because she was on a waiting list for
                over a year.</p>
                <p>I commend all the staff of the Health Service, especially the
                nurses and doctors in hospitals throughout this country. They
                are being mentally and physically affected by these problems. I
                support this motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p>Mr J Kelly:</p>
                </b>
                <p>Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I support the
                motion, but I disagree with Mr McGrady’s view about finance.
                This is a matter of finance. Any consultant, doctor, nurse or
                hospital executive will say that. There is no doubt that the
                health services in this part of Ireland are underfunded.
                Research tells us that the north of Ireland is losing the battle
                for increased investment in personal health services. We know
                that there has been an increase of 12% in Scotland as against
                7·2% here. In England, £1 billion has been invested in the
                improvement of primary care because of new initiatives announced
                last year by the British Government. There is a disparity
                between the funding of the Health Service here and the Health
                Services in England, Scotland, Wales and the rest of Ireland.</p>
                <p>Waiting lists, as we all know, do not happen by accident.
                Nurses, doctors and consultants are not happy to see people
                waiting in corridors for a bed or to be examined or operated on.
                They are there to ease pain and suffering. They do not want to
                see that happening in any hospital in this part of Ireland.</p>
                <p>The problem goes back to the underfunding of the Health
                Service in the north of Ireland. It comes down to what is
                available to cover scarce resources. I was on the phone this
                morning to a rheumatology consultant. Hundreds of people are
                waiting for a new drug, at a cost of £700 per month, to ease
                their pain, but there is no money for that drug. There are
                people suffering from certain forms of leukaemia who require a
                drug that eases their pain and helps prolong their life. It
                costs £100,000 a year to ease the suffering of one person.</p>
                <p>It is a question of finance. Doctors and other staff in the
                hospital services are also under pressure. They are trying to
                decide how the money should be allocated. It is unfair that that
                extra burden should be placed on them. We need to know how much
                money is needed. Mr Berry said that about £60 million per annum
                would be required if all the elements of the Hayes report were
                to be implemented, and he said that we would never get that
                amount of money. However, if we are serious about health, we
                must be serious about finding the money to alleviate the
                suffering.</p>
                <p>This is a matter not just for the Minister of Health, but for
                the whole Executive. If the Assembly is saying that the Health
                Service is underfunded, we should approach the members of our
                parties who are on the Executive and put the case to them. We
                should ask them to exercise their influence to find the moneys
                that are so desperately needed.</p>
                <p>Many things in life, including home and family, come down to
                finance. Finance is the big factor in the problems that confront
                the Health Service. Doctors, nurses and professionals are trying
                their best with limited resources and, we must find the money to
                ensure that the suffering is alleviated, if not obliterated.</p>

                </b>
                <p>Health should be our number one priority. Someone who does
                not enjoy good health cannot wholeheartedly enjoy life. It is up
                to those of us who, thank God, enjoy good health and are in a
                position to provide a good comprehensive Health Service to
                enable everyone in the community to be as free as possible from
                unnecessary pain, anxiety or suffering, and thus live and
                contribute to society for many years in good or, at least,
                reasonable health.</p>
                <p>The rot in the National Health Service and the increasing
                waiting lists started some years ago when the Thatcher Tory
                Government presided over a massive reduction in funding and
                training, and it has continued to this day. We used to call the
                Tory Government uncaring and they certainly deserved that title.
                I hope that those years are now behind us. We were promised a
                modern, quality Health Service by the new Labour Government —
                that has yet to be achieved.</p>
                <p>Waiting lists and times are getting worse. &quot;Trolley
                time&quot; and &quot;armchair time&quot; are new expressions,
                but they are also getting worse and are totally unacceptable.
                Behind every figure on a waiting list is a human being who is
                not in good health and is quite possibly in pain, probably
                severe pain. That could and should be preventable. I have
                listened to constituents crying for help to get off waiting
                lists. They have been on those lists for far too long, and in
                many cases they are convinced that they are being overlooked,
                forgotten or just not considered to be as important as other
                patients because they are senior citizens. It is a shame that
                any official or consultant would discriminate against a patient
                because of his or her age. The Assembly has offered its support
                to senior citizens, not only in health care but in other areas
                that contribute to better health. Elderly patients must never be
                overlooked or abandoned, and they cannot be expected to remain
                on a waiting list for any longer than is necessary. Waiting
                times for patients affect young and old, and there are signs
                that the waiting lists will continue to increase across the
                spectrum unless radical action is taken immediately.</p>
                <p>There are all sorts of reasons for the situation. The
                Assembly must tackle the inherited problems. The Health Minister
                has acknowledged that underfunding has taken place over the
                years, and Members must give her credit for what she has
                achieved. However, she must do more. Eight million pounds was
                found to tackle the waiting list problem. That is welcome, but
                much more is required. That is why the Alliance Party calls for
                tax-varying powers for the Assembly. We must have the money as
                well as the power to make a difference to people’s lives.</p>
                <p>The Executive must be convinced of the need for considerable
                extra funding to reduce waiting times and waiting lists. Every
                effort must be made to ensure that funds are not squandered and
                that fat-cat handouts are stopped. The public must also help by
                attending appointments on time and by not making fraudulent
                prescription claims. Those measures would add money to the
                Health Service’s coffers. The total cessation of paramilitary
                attacks — which are on the increase — would also help the
                already over-stretched resources and cut back on waiting times.
                Those acts of barbarism require emergency treatment that uses
                resources that would otherwise be used to cut down waiting
                times.</p>
                <p>Even with Mr Blair’s return to power, the Health Service
                continues to fail. Recently, the Department of Health, Social
                Services and Public Safety has sent patients to other European
                countries for treatment in its efforts to reduce the waiting
                lists. That is far from ideal, but I suspect that many patients
                would be happy to do that if the alternative were to remain at
                home in pain.</p>
                <p>Today may be the last Assembly sitting. On behalf of
                suffering patients on waiting lists and everybody in Northern
                Ireland who might be on a waiting list in the future, I appeal
                to the Minister to do what the Assembly wants to do — continue
                the business for everyone in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <b>
                <p>Mr Boyd:</p>
                </b>
                <p>Most Members have direct knowledge of the issue of hospital
                waiting lists, because of the number of constituents affected.
                It is unacceptable that waiting lists should continue to grow.
                There are over 54,000 people on waiting lists for treatment and
                operations, and that brings with it a lot of pain and misery.
                Northern Ireland has the longest waiting lists in the United
                Kingdom, and the additional £13 million allocated in the past
                12 months to address the problem has had little impact on
                halting the trend. Waiting lists have increased by 5,000 in the
                past 12 months, and the situation will deteriorate further in
                the coming winter months.</p>
                <p>Fractures are a huge problem, made worse by the daily
                paramilitary beatings and shootings that create an enormous
                strain on vital health resources. Many people bury their heads
                in the sand and hide from the problem. The Government’s
                patient’s charter states that patients will receive treatment
                within 48 hours of admission, compared with the 24-hour target
                for the rest of the United Kingdom. Despite that, in the past
                four months, over 1,000 fracture patients have had to wait more
                than 96 hours for treatment.</p>
                <p>The Royal Victoria Hospital, which is the only facility for
                cardiac surgery in Northern Ireland, was recently forced to
                cancel heart operations because of a shortage of beds. That is
                scandalous. People stay longer in hospital because of the lack
                of resources for a full care-in-the- community programme. That
                creates a shortage of hospital beds, and we have horrendous
                examples of patients sleeping on trolleys and in corridors.
                Doctors and nurses work a horrendous number of additional hours.</p>
                <p>A vital meals-on-wheels service in Carrickfergus may have to
                cease because of lack of funding. That will result in greater
                demand for home helps, a service that is already under severe
                pressure. Despite all of that, many health trust chief
                executives continue to enjoy huge and unjustified annual pay
                rises, sometimes up to 27%. Do we need all those boards and
                trusts?</p>

                <p>Waiting lists for occupational therapy visits are at crisis
                level. Disabled people are particularly affected, and many have
                been waiting for months, even years, for grants to carry out
                essential repairs and improvements to their properties. My local
                Housing Executive office has told me that money for such much
                needed work is available but is not being taken up because of
                occupational therapy waiting lists. That is not a criticism of
                occupational therapists; it is the exact opposite. I know
                occupational therapists who are working additional hours without
                pay to help those in need of their services.</p>
                <p>The University of Ulster at Jordanstown made the foolish
                decision to deny a young person, who attained two As and one C
                at A level, a place on an occupational therapy course, because
                she did not get three Bs. She has been able to attend the same
                course in Edinburgh. There is a possibility that that student
                and many others will complete their studies in other parts of
                the United Kingdom and get employment outside Northern Ireland.
                That situation is illogical. Our occupational therapy lists are
                critical, and we must aim to keep our young people and their
                much-needed skills here.</p>
                <p>There are no rheumatology services for patients in the
                Northern Board area, and those awaiting diagnosis are sent to
                Belfast, which has a waiting list of up to 16 months. That is
                unacceptable. The hospital waiting list crisis graphically
                illustrates the folly of those who naively believed that the
                Assembly would be the answer to all our problems. Despite the
                additional resources, the waiting list situation is continuing
                to deteriorate. The Assembly has failed the people of Northern
                Ireland.</p>
                <b>
                <p>Mr Douglas:</p>
                </b>
                <p>The problem with waiting lists in the Health Service is not
                new. People are concerned that the lists are growing, while
                little is done at strategic level to deal with them. I am sure
                that every Member knows someone who is waiting for an operation
                or some other surgical procedure. Those with the least need will
                probably be taken first, but that will only massage the waiting
                times.</p>
                <p>There appears to be a severe problem with orthopaedic
                procedures. We often hear horrific stories of people waiting
                days for treatment for broken limbs. The main reason for that is
                the shortage of beds. The problem is particularly acute in
                winter, but it is with us at all times of the year. Many
                surgical beds are taken up by medical emergencies for which
                there is also inadequate provision. That must be dealt with
                immediately.</p>
                <p>There are difficulties with recruiting and retaining staff,
                particularly nursing staff in intensive care units. Many major
                operations could be carried out if suitably qualified staff were
                available. The main obstacle to recruiting and retaining staff
                is the poor pay that they receive for the responsibilities that
                they shoulder. Compared with staff in other countries that
                recognise the importance and skill of the profession, our
                nursing staff are shamefully treated and poorly paid. I ask the
                Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety to push
                for a significant increase in pay for our nursing staff at a
                time when the pay review body is taking evidence on the subject.
                We have a dedicated workforce in the Health Service, but we
                cannot expect people to work for gratitude alone. Hospitals must
                be well staffed if we are to have a responsive service.</p>
                <p>It has been stated that in Northern Ireland we have the
                longest waiting lists in the UK, but significant strides forward
                have been made in the area of cardiac operations. That has been
                possible because the boards have purchased services from the
                mainland. HCI International Health Centre in Glasgow has carried
                out many cardiac and hip operations under contract for the
                Western Board. Most of the patients that I spoke to journeyed to
                Glasgow, and they gave good reports of their experience and the
                care that they received. I do not advocate that as a long-term
                remedy, but if we can see shorter lists and a healthier
                population as a result of such initiatives, we must provide
                funding to achieve those aims.</p>
                <p>In the past 10 years, we have seen the rolling closure of
                small hospitals across the Province. The beds that were lost
                were not replaced by the larger ‘golden six’ hospitals. Many
                of those beds were for long-term care and minor operations,
                which took pressure off the larger centres and provided
                step-down care. If that system were adopted, we would see
                critical care places released more swiftly, and more people
                would ultimately be treated. Those spaces would come at less
                cost to the Health Service, because they would not require the
                same level of medical supervision and expertise as the larger
                centres.</p>
                <p>We must place the subject at the top of our agenda. Our
                system must ensure that we have more bed spaces, manned by
                well-paid and motivated personnel, to ensure that the Health
                Service can treat more people with appropriate, adequately
                resourced step-down care. In the long term, it would be cost
                effective, creating savings in other areas of the health budget.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, we must purchase more high quality care from
                other providers, if necessary. We must not remain at the bottom
                of the league. We often hear the cry that certain people are
                second-class citizens. I ask the Minister to ensure that we do
                not have a second- class Health Service in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <b>
                <p>Ms McWilliams:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As this is one of the last debates before
                suspension — although there are days yet to play for — I
                would like to record my concern about what happened during
                Question Time yesterday, when it appeared OK to beat up the
                Minister and hold her solely responsible for the Health Service
                budget. The problem will be resolved only when the Executive sit
                down this Thursday and make funding available not only for this
                area, but to address the serious issues that come up every day.
                The facts are well known, because of the media coverage and
                because Members have asked question after question.</p>
                <p>I was disappointed. Where is the collective responsibility
                for the Health Service in Northern Ireland? Either the members
                of the Executive begin to get to grips with the issue and agree
                that Northern Ireland’s Health Service is of concern to all of
                them, or they leave Minister de Brún on her own to face the
                Question Time wrath of Members from other parties who feel that
                that is the way to get the budget increased. Members of other
                parties represented on the Executive should take the opportunity
                between now and Thursday to tell their Ministers what they said
                at Question Time — that they would like to see an increase in
                the budget.</p>
                <p>The demand for £122 million has been put forward as an
                urgent requirement. As a member of the Committee for Health,
                Social Services and Public Safety, I am concerned that we will
                not get £122 million. We will simply go on having this debate.
                If the budget increase is as urgent as Members are suggesting,
                it should be the number one priority for Thursday’s meeting.
                Then we could argue whether the Executive are truly functioning
                or not. Certainly, having witnessed yesterday’s responses to
                Members’ concerns about waiting lists, I feel that the
                Executive’s sense of collective responsibility leaves a lot to
                be desired.</p>
                <p>There are three issues. There is the issue of how Northern
                Ireland is faring compared to the rest of Britain, with regard
                to funding. It is not just about money, it is also about
                management and what was once called manpower, but is now called
                human resources. I have mentioned funding. It is extremely
                important for the Minister to tell us whether, with the
                available funding, it is realistic to think about getting the
                numbers down from 54,000 to 48,000, or anywhere close to the
                target of 39,000. If that remains a realistic target, how soon
                will it be met?</p>
                <p>Other things happened that were out of the Minister’s
                control, such as the use of single-use instruments in
                tonsillectomies, which caused waiting lists to go up. Can the
                Minister tell us about anything else that resulted in targets
                not being met? Is there another explanation? There may be other
                explanations; but if it is not about funding alone, we need to
                know what other things must be factored in. Are sickness levels
                increasing, or is it that the longer people stay on the waiting
                lists, the sicker they become and the longer they take to
                recover? Hence, the waiting list cycle goes on. From calls made
                today, and on other occasions, to the Royal Victoria Hospital, I
                know that our regional centre is in danger of collapsing.</p>
                <p>Theatres are cancelling operations, and a cancellation
                culture exists in Northern Ireland’s regional centre, where
                people from across the Province have urgent operations. There
                are two reasons for that, and a strategy must be put in place.
                One reason is that there are not enough anaesthetists. The
                trainee anaesthetists who used to want to work in the Royal
                after they completed their training no longer want to do so and
                do not stay to become consultants. The second reason is that
                there are insufficient intensive care beds. When will there be a
                framework, and when will the human resource strategy be in
                place?</p>

                <p>I totally endorse Mr McGrady’s motion. However, I listened
                with a degree of political astonishment to Ms McWilliams’s
                remarks —</p>

                </b>
                <p>I listened to her remarks about the beating up of Ministers.
                I have made that point since the Assembly began: there is no
                collective responsibility. The Executive cannot control
                individual Ministers, who act as warlords in their respective
                Ministries, and in those circumstances they become the objects
                of collective criticism and attack rather than of collective
                support. I am surprised that that astonishes Monica McWilliams
                — <i>[Interruption].</p>
                </i>
                <p>Members went through a long catalogue of deficiencies in the
                Health Service, but we must look at the root causes. Many
                Members are cheerleaders for devolution. Devolution was supposed
                to bring more sensitive, accountable and effective government.
                Yet, under devolution, standards of the health care in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland are falling below even the indifferent
                standards of the National Health Service in the rest of the
                United Kingdom. Devolution was never properly financed from the
                start. Those who negotiated the Belfast Agreement were so busy
                with purely political and constitutional matters that they never
                directed their mind to the price that they ought to have
                demanded from central Government for taking on the
                responsibilities of devolved government. Devolution has enabled
                central Government to distance themselves from the welfare of
                the people of Northern Ireland. The block grant controlled by
                the British Exchequer simply leaves the devolved Government to
                divide an inadequate cake, the size of which is determined by
                others.</p>

                <p>The reply to our complaints of disparity of service with the
                mainland will be: &quot;How you allocate your money among
                competing priorities is a matter for you, not us.&quot; However,
                some economies and some reforms may be made. Dr Hendron and
                others have pointed out the need for drastic reform in the
                bureaucratic organisation of the Health Service and the vast
                amount of money that could be saved by severely pruning
                bureaucratic expenses, not only in salaries but in the provision
                of facilities that are available.</p>
                <p>I also mention something that was taken up by a number of
                contributors. I shall indulge, if I may, in a bit of
                &quot;beating-up&quot; of the Minister responsible. The Minister
                responsible is from Sinn Féin, a party that Prime Ministers
                have said is inextricably linked with the IRA. The treatment of
                victims of the IRA and its counterparts in the so-called
                Loyalist organisations eats up an enormous amount of money.
                Every year, huge amounts of money, particularly in orthopaedics,
                are paid out to treat the victims of IRA and Loyalist terror,
                yet we have a Minister who is also given the duty of attempting
                to economise. For their own purposes, Central Government are
                willing to lay out up to £200 million on the bloody Sunday
                inquiry, and perhaps another £50 million to £100 million on
                some of the additional inquiries that are being called for. That
                money and other money could be used for Unionist patients,
                Nationalist patients and all other patients in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p>If we want to get the Health Service right; if we want to get
                our priorities right; if we really care about the welfare,
                economic well-being, health, and education of the people of
                Northern Ireland, we will have to return to real democracy,
                instead of a partnership between a terrible form of democracy
                and terrorism.</p>
                <b>
                <p>Mr Davis:</p>
                </b>
                <p>A previous speaker mentioned that this subject has been
                visited many times. The topic of waiting lists has been raised
                in the Assembly since the Executive took office. All Members
                have grave concerns.</p>
                <p>It must be accepted that the Minister cannot be blamed for a
                historical problem that has been with us since direct rule.
                However, the Minister should remember the sign on President
                Truman’s desk, which stated: &quot;The buck stops here&quot;.
                Waiting lists are now the Minister’s ultimate responsibility,
                and it is up to her to provide a solution.</p>
                <p>Last week we were told that waiting lists were at their
                highest level ever. That is not acceptable in a society that
                should pride itself on the care of those who are in ill health
                and who face long periods of pain and discomfort because the
                structures are not in place to treat them. In March 2000, over
                47,000 people were awaiting elective treatment — an increase
                of more than 11,000 in the four years from 1996. Only last week
                the Minister confirmed that the figure had risen to over 54,000
                by the end of June 2001 — an increase of 4·3% since March.</p>
                <p>There has also been a huge increase in waiting times. Between
                1966 and 2000, the numbers waiting for treatment for 18 months
                or more increased from 632 to 5,200.</p>
                <p>The Minister has set targets for the reduction and
                elimination of those unacceptable figures. That is to be
                welcomed, but there is currently no clear indication that those
                targets can and will be met.</p>
                <p>In many cases, the elderly are suffering. They are the
                greatest users of health care resources. That is the nature of
                the problem, and it will always be so. However, it is unfair
                that those who have been the backbone of society in the past are
                now suffering because of the problems of the present. The long
                wait to deal with matters such as cataracts and joint
                replacement is a scandal that must be addressed quickly.</p>
                <p>Northern Ireland is short of specialist surgeons in
                orthopaedics and neurology, and the departure of even one
                surgeon from these specialities can cause a crisis. Over the
                years, the system has received additional money, but the
                position does not appear to have been greatly improved. It was
                reported in May that there was a delay of nine months even to
                get on to the waiting list in some specialities. It was also
                reported that there was a wait of nearly two years for what are
                described as non-emergency operations. All of that reflects
                badly on the current system.</p>
                <p>Much of the problem is historical. The drive by the
                Conservative Government towards market economics in all aspects
                of society — especially in health — was ill-judged and
                ill-thought-out nonsense. We are paying for that folly now
                because we have a system that was introduced with cost-cutting
                priorities rather than health care factors in mind.</p>
                <p>There has been a problem with the number of medical staff,
                and the long lead-in periods required for training new staff
                have not helped. These matters, and others, will take time to
                sort out. Demand for health care will always be on the increase.
                People are living longer, and their health care costs increase
                as they grow older. The birth rate is falling, and that, along
                with other factors, means that the costs will fall upon the
                narrow band of those in employment.</p>
                <p>We must look closely at the entire health care system. It is
                notable that in some European countries almost twice as much of
                the gross domestic product is spent on health care than is spent
                in the United Kingdom. Northern Ireland is tied to United
                Kingdom spending levels, but the Minister must find the means,
                regardless of those financial restraints, to deal with an urgent
                and growing problem. Pressure is mounting on the system, and the
                limited projected spending increases per head of the population
                to the end of this decade will only exacerbate the situation,
                with Northern Ireland falling further behind comparable United
                Kingdom regions.</p>
                <p>I support the motion. I have no doubt that this issue will be
                a recurring theme for a long time to come.</p>
                <b>
                <p>Mrs Courtney:</p>
                </b>
                <p>I support the motion and congratulate my Colleague Mr McGrady
                for proposing it.</p>
                <p>Members have already spoken about the dramatic increase in
                waiting lists that may have cost people their lives. Figures
                recently released by the Department of Health, Social Services
                and Public Safety confirm that increase. A comparison of the
                quarter ending June 2001 with the quarter ending March 2001
                shows that the total number of patients waiting has increased by
                4·3%. Over the year, comparing the end of June 2001 with the
                end of June 2000, the total number waiting has increased by
                9·5%. Over the past year, therefore, the total number of people
                waiting for a hospital bed has increased by almost 10%. More
                than 54,000 people are waiting for treatment. That is not good
                enough.</p>
                <p>We must ask how many people have suffered or have died while
                waiting to undergo treatment. How many family members’ lives
                have been affected while patients wait for vital surgery? I
                appreciate the fact that the Minister of Health, Bairbre de
                Brún, is in the House today. There is an onus on her to explain
                the reasons for these appalling figures and the high rise in
                waiting times.</p>
                <p>I accept that the growth in the numbers awaiting elective
                procedures must be seen in the light of the overall increase in
                pressure on our hospitals. However, only last week the chairman
                of the Western Health and Social Services Board stated that the
                staff at Altnagelvin Hospital are near breaking point as they
                push themselves to retain high standards of service with
                inadequate resources. That is repeated in hospitals throughout
                the Province. There is no point in attempting to reduce waiting
                lists at the expense of the health of doctors, nurses and health
                professionals, who are stretched to the limit.</p>
                <p>The Minister states that work is already underway to address
                the problem of waiting lists. Although I accept that that is the
                case, waiting lists will never be reduced without adequate
                resources. There is no point in appointing extra consultants in
                specialist areas, such as orthopaedics, if the resources are not
                in place to employ staff such as theatre and intensive care
                nurses, orderlies and other professionals who are necessary to
                provide back-up. At present, there are many examples in our
                hospitals of consultants being appointed as a cosmetic exercise
                because of public pressure. As other members of staff are not
                available, and theatre space is at a premium, consultants
                already in post must hand over operating sessions to allow the
                new employee to work. That is not acceptable. To make such
                appointments only fools the public and does not help the
                situation. The Minister must be made aware of that.</p>
                <p>I agree that there has been historic underfunding in the
                Health Service. However, if we are ever going to make a serious
                attempt to cut waiting lists for elective surgery we must listen
                to the staff who are continually under pressure. They are the
                same people who are expected to work long hours because, for
                example, they have to cover sick leave. More money must be found
                to pay for extra staff. There is no point in a hospital owning a
                magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner or a computerised axial
                tomography (CAT) scanner if the staff are only available during
                office hours — 9.00 am to 5.00 pm. Hospitals need to provide a
                24-hour service — emergencies occur at all times.</p>
                <p>In the Royal Group of Hospitals we can see the serious
                consequences of not having back-up resources. Cardiac operations
                have been cancelled because there have not been enough intensive
                care beds. A complete re-evaluation of the system must be
                undertaken. I support what my Colleague, Dr Hendron, said about
                changing the management structures. We must look seriously at
                that issue.</p>
                <p>Our waiting lists are currently the worst in the United
                Kingdom. We must make a concerted effort to ensure that the next
                quarter’s report shows considerable improvement on the most
                recent one.</p>
                <b>
                <p>Mrs I Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p>It is with great concern and a degree of frustration that we
                find ourselves debating this important issue. The fact that the
                topic of waiting lists for elective surgery has reached the
                Chamber should illustrate the serious nature of the issue and
                the urgent need for action. On quarterly and annual comparisons,
                inpatient waiting lists have increased by 4·3% and 9·5%
                respectively. The total number of people on the waiting list has
                increased by 2,251 since March 2001.</p>
                <p>Rather than witness an increase in the quality of service,
                the past few years have seen the NHS and health care provision
                undermined and reduced. The figures released in the Department
                of Health, Social Services and Public Safety’s monitoring
                returns are cause for grave concern. The number of people
                waiting for inpatient and outpatient treatment in Northern
                Ireland has increased considerably. They have not only risen
                since the last quarter; in comparison to this time last year, in
                some cases, they have increased dramatically.</p>
                <p>One of the most worrying aspects is the number of patients
                who are termed &quot;excess waiters&quot;. There are people who
                are seeking inpatient treatment and have been waiting more than
                12 months for cardiac surgery and 18 months or more for other
                specialist treatment. The increase of 15·8% for that group
                since last year is alarming.</p>
                <p>It is particularly worrying that the Eastern Health and
                Social Services Board is responsible for 60% of the inpatients
                who are waiting for treatment, and a staggering 78% of those who
                are classed as &quot;excess waiters&quot;. Of course, statistics
                are always susceptible to being twisted and massaged to suit one’s
                own point of view. In this case, however, the figures do not
                require any artificial enhancement.</p>
                <i>
                <p>3.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p>The statistics prove that this issue must surely be
                addressed. The doctors, nurses and other staff servicing the NHS
                are under serious pressure, and we must pay tribute to all those
                who are doing their best to carry out their duties.</p>
                <p>However, it is obvious that the Department of Health, Social
                Services and Public Safety has failed to address the problem. It
                is now time for the Department to look seriously at the
                considerable problems that exist. The published figures show
                that, without an increase in the financial support given to the
                NHS by the Government, the service will eventually have more
                people waiting for treatment than are actually receiving
                treatment. If the necessary and resolute action to address the
                problem is not taken now, the service will continue to
                deteriorate.</p>
                <p>Therefore, it is essential that sufficient funds are provided
                so that local services can meet demands for surgery. We must do
                all in our power to maximise what health care provision we have
                left.</p>
                <p>I am sure that most, if not all, MLA’s receive a heavy
                mailbag of letters from their constituents every day imploring
                us to use our good offices to enable loved ones to get
                appointments with consultants. Worst of all, we often receive
                complaints outlining how loved ones would still be alive if they
                had been able to access services in time.</p>
                <p>It is an utter disgrace that, to date, we do not even have
                the money in place to start the building of the new cancer
                hospital at the Belfast City Hospital site — especially when
                we consider that cancer is our number one killer, claiming more
                victims than strokes or chest and heart illnesses. Meanwhile,
                Belvoir Park Hospital has to cope with huge waiting lists and
                run-down hospital equipment. Unless we take the bull by the
                horns and dismantle the four boards and 19 trusts, this
                top-heavy structure will use up much-needed revenue.</p>
                <p>The NHS needs additional, financial assistance. This
                Administration, like all new Administrations, takes the easy
                option of blaming the previous incumbents for the failures and
                inadequacies of the system. In Northern Ireland, the message is
                that any shortcomings are due to previous direct rule from
                Westminster. It is only a matter of time before this bluff is
                uncovered. Three years have passed, and we have still not
                addressed the problem of bureaucracy, much less any other
                problems. I support the motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p>Mr Molloy:</p>
                </b>
                <p>Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. We all agree
                that waiting lists have escalated over the last number of years.
                This trend started about 30 years ago. We need to rectify that
                situation. No one can stand over the long waiting lists or
                waiting times.</p>
                <p>We reject the Hayes review as it has failed to deal with the
                problem sufficiently. It has failed to deliver any new or
                imaginative thinking in relation to hospitals or acute care
                facilities — particularly in rural areas.</p>
                <p>However, we also have to examine the root of the problem.
                Like Iris Robinson, I would like to see a restructuring of the
                boards, but the Hayes review does not address that problem.
                Replacing four boards with three, or 19 trusts with a greater or
                fewer number of trusts will not solve the problem of bureaucracy
                in the system.</p>
                <p>I agree with Mrs Robinson that each Administration blames the
                previous one. However, we can clearly point the finger of blame
                at the last Conservative Administration, which many Unionists
                propped up. That Administration ran down the entire Health
                Service over many years. There are Unionist MPs in the Chamber
                today who stood by over the last 30 years and allowed the Health
                Service to be run down by Margaret Thatcher and others in the
                Conservative Administration. It is quite clear as to when we
                fell into this rut; and we have a right to point the finger at
                those who are to blame.</p>
                <p>Research also shows that other European countries,
                particularly the Twenty-six Counties, have reduced the problem
                of waiting by putting enough money in place to ensure a proper
                service. While all parties in the Chamber agree that we need to
                reduce waiting lists, we also need to agree that one of the ways
                to do that is to provide adequate funding for the service. We
                need to ensure that we have a proper service in the future. It
                cannot be done by people pointing to cancer services, hospitals
                and other services and saying that the proper money has not been
                put in. The money can only come from the Chamber and from the
                block grant — it cannot come from anywhere else.</p>
                <p>We have missed out on opportunities under the present British
                Administration. They have made announcements on health every
                time they needed a perk for an election or for some other issue.
                They have put large amounts of money into the Health Service in
                England to eradicate problems there, but we have not got our
                fair share of that money. The Barnett formula has failed to
                deliver and failed to follow need in this particular situation.
                We have not got a fair share of the distribution of the money.
                While Mr Durkan announced a 7·2% increase in the health budget
                last year, in Scotland it was 12%. In England, £1 billion was
                invested to improve primary care. That is money being allocated
                for a particular reason, and if we had received our fair share
                we would have at least had an extra £35 million to put into the
                Health Service.</p>
                <p>We need to put our money where our mouths are. The test here
                is whether the Executive have a collective decision-making
                process. Where will all the parties actually stand when the
                Minister of Finance and Personnel asks where they want to
                allocate money to? It is recognised by most parties that an
                injection of money is required by the Health Service. We need a
                collective voice today. We want the Health Service to be a
                priority in order to get the bulk of this year’s Budget. We
                want to ensure that the Health Service can provide the proper
                health care facility that we all want and that we all talk
                about. We have to meet the needs of that service, and it will
                only happen if we have a collective decision in the Chamber and
                in the Executive.</p>
                <p>We can lay the blame and pass the buck, but at the end of the
                day the buck will stop at the Executive and the Assembly. The
                Assembly needs to be satisfied with the budgets when they come
                here to be approved. The Committees scrutinising the whole
                process need to be satisfied that enough money is going into the
                Health Service to allow the Minister to deal with the problem.
                We also need to be able to trace that money. I accept that there
                are certain question marks over where the money allocated to the
                boards and trusts ends up. I hope that the Assembly gives a very
                clear message to the Minister of Finance and Personnel that we
                want to prioritise health in the new Budget.</p>

                <p>Mr Savage:</p>
                </b>
                <p>There can be no doubt that a waiting list crisis exists in
                the Health Service. Only yesterday, in answer to a question from
                my Colleague, the Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Mrs
                Carson), the Minister told the House, in a document deposited in
                the Library, that the Southern Health and Social Services Board
                had a waiting list of 228 for hernia operations, with 32 people
                waiting more than a year. I noted that 5 patients had been
                waiting more than two years. With mounting disbelief I went on
                to read that, across the Province, 26 people had been waiting
                for a hernia operation for more than two years.</p>
                <p>I mention hernia operations because, as the Minister knows, I
                am currently dealing with such an issue for a lady constituent
                from Lurgan who has been waiting for more than two years. I
                suppose she is one of the Minister’s statistics. She was
                placed on a waiting list in October 1998 and is still waiting,
                with no date for the operation having been set. In fact, her
                consultant informs me that she is still fourteenth on the list.
                This lady is more than a statistic. She is suffering daily
                discomfort and pain, to the extent that her quality of life is
                severely curtailed. That is the reality of waiting lists —
                pain and suffering.</p>
                <p>Further searching of the Minister’s document showed that
                approximately 20 people had waited for more than two years for
                knee replacement operations, and some of the figures that were
                supplied yesterday, including those for heart bypass operations,
                were provisional. That word may be appropriate for the Minister,
                but it is not appropriate in a written answer to an Assembly
                question about a major public service. Such data should be
                readily available because it enables the public to judge the
                service they are paying for.</p>
                <p>I urge the Minister to give serious consideration to a
                suggestion by my colleague, Dr Adamson, that patients who have
                waited for a long time be treated in European hospitals. That
                happens in Great&nbsp;Britain, where patients are transferred to
                France and Belgium, and it is no more expensive than treating
                them here.</p>
                <p>Insufficient capacity causes long waiting lists. Hospitals in
                Europe have more capacity, so why not transfer long-wait
                patients there for treatment? After all, we are all Europeans,
                so why not give people the choice of going to Europe or, if they
                prefer, wait here on the long list.</p>
                <p>The Minister’s paper also shows that people in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland have a significantly longer average
                waiting time than people in England and Scotland in two out of
                four key areas. In Northern&nbsp;Ireland the average wait for a
                cataract removal is 227&nbsp;days, compared with 119&nbsp;days
                in Scotland. In Northern&nbsp;Ireland someone needing a knee
                replacement operation has a waiting time of 234&nbsp;days,
                compared with 105&nbsp;days in Scotland.</p>
                <p>There appears to be a serious shortfall in specialisms, and I
                ask the Minister when and how that will be addressed. It gives
                me no pleasure to point that out, because I have nothing but the
                highest regard for the doctors and nurses who are so dedicated
                to our Health Service. However, the Assembly has a right to
                demand a better performance from our Minister when addressing
                the glaring issue of hospital waiting lists.</p>
                <p>She has been in office for approximately three years, and
                that is just a little longer than a constituent of mine has been
                waiting for her operation. However, a further extension of the
                accident and emergency unit in Craigavon Area Hospital will open
                soon, and I give the Minister credit for that. It will help to
                alleviate some of the problems confronting that area.</p>
                <p>I know the Minister takes the problem very seriously, but if
                something is not done to alleviate the situation, it will get
                out of hand altogether. I support the motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p>Madam Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p>There are two further Members to speak, and I ask both to
                curtail their contributions to two&nbsp;minutes.</p>

                <p>Ms Hanna:</p>
                </b>
                <p>I support the motion. The statistics are depressing. The
                headline rate of increase is accelerating. The three months up
                to June saw an increase of more than 47% of the yearly increase.
                If the rate of increase continues unchecked, there could be a
                waiting list of more than 64,000 by June 2002. The last quarter
                did not include the winter pressures.</p>
                <p>The only qualitative criterion for determining whether a
                patient needs an operation is an assessment of clinical need.
                The emphasis on waiting lists distorts clinical priorities, and
                the pressure on acute hospitals to meet heart targets means that
                there has been undue emphasis on performing larger numbers of
                routine operations at the expense of patients who need longer,
                more complex and ultimately more serious operations.</p>
                <p>Doctors with outpatients waiting for investigations such as
                magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, possibly to diagnose
                serious illnesses, have to resort to admitting patients into
                acute beds to move them up the waiting list, and that compounds
                the problem.</p>
                <p>We do not live in a perfect world. If a quantitative
                benchmark is to be used, the length of time that a patient is on
                a list is a better measurement than the number of patients on a
                list.</p>

                </i>
                <p>The situation is not just drifting; it is out of control. On
                11 September the Minister said that she was very concerned at
                the growth in the number of patients awaiting admission. I am
                sure that she is, but, with respect, she is paid to do much more
                than that. She went on to say that the basic problems are money,
                lack of investment and past underfunding. Nobody will disagree
                with that.</p>
                <p>We want to know what specific proposals the Minister has put
                to her Executive colleagues. We need details, chapter and verse.
                We need to know what monitoring is taking place to ensure that
                the actions outlined in the framework for action on waiting
                lists are being implemented and monitored. If we do not know
                what is being measured, we do not know what actions are
                effective. The Minister is in a difficult position. She has a
                complex portfolio —</p>
                <b>
                <p>Mr Shannon:</p>
                </b>
                <p>In my constituency there is one of the largest hospitals in
                Northern Ireland — the Ulster Hospital. It has repeatedly been
                in the news over the length of time that people have had to wait
                before getting medical attention or a necessary operation. A
                source told me just last week that the waiting time for
                emergency theatre treatment was three days. If someone required
                a bone pinned or a wound stitched, they would have to wait more
                than 72 hours.</p>
                <p>I would expect the sort of scenes that patients described to
                me last week to have come from a war film or a Dickens novel.
                There were people waiting on trolleys and in corridors, and some
                critical surgeries were taking place in the wards alongside
                other patients. This situation is not only deplorable, but also
                deadly dangerous. Infections are rife in wards, with methicillin-resistant
                staphylococcus aureus being a killer disease that affects every
                hospital in the United Kingdom. The carrying-out of procedures
                in wards where an infection that attacks open wounds is present
                is unbelievable, but we can understand how desperate doctors are
                to administer the aid that they are trained to give.</p>
                <p>Many people, including myself, are further angered because
                the Minister and the Department do not seem to know how to spend
                money or time wisely. We were recently told in an article that
                the Ulster Community and Hospitals Trust was to receive an
                investment of £20 million, yet the lists keep getting longer.</p>
                <p>I was made aware yesterday of a new scheme operating in the
                trust area. A social worker’s assistant delivered folders to
                each person claiming disability living allowance. The folders
                contained five sections, and every time a home help, social
                worker or health visitor pays a call to a client, they must
                write the purpose of the visit on the folders. Two things have
                been highlighted by that: first, the money spent on the folders,
                dividers, paper and, not least, the petrol; and secondly that a
                member of staff was specifically sent out to do that job. It is
                a waste of money.</p>
                <p>Much money is wasted annually on the administrative side of
                the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety. The
                old Newtownards Hospital is a prime example, having had many of
                its wards, such as the Thomas Bailie ward, turned into offices.
                It was converted both physically, with bricks and mortar, and
                also decoratively. The bill was staggering. I suggest that some
                of the money spent on the decor should be spent on reducing
                hospital waiting lists.</p>

                <p>I am grateful to Mr McGrady for tabling this important
                motion. Today’s debate has covered an issue of deep concern to
                many people in our community.</p>
                <p>I have listened carefully and with great interest to the
                points made by Mr McGrady and other Members. Many of the views
                expressed echo my own thoughts: thoughts about the
                unacceptability of sick people waiting for a long time for
                treatment; thoughts about the increasing pressures on our acute
                and community services; and thoughts about our staff, who
                continue to provide a professional service. I am grateful to
                Members for stressing the value they place on health service
                staff.</p>
                <p>Like other Members, I listen to constituents who value our
                health and social services and feel betrayed when these services
                are not readily available to meet their needs. I too have spoken
                to constituents who have to wait, often in pain or distress, for
                a hospital operation, or support at home. I also share Members’
                desires to put in place high-quality and responsive services
                that will be available to support those who need them, when they
                need them.</p>
                <p>What are the obstacles to achieving this shared vision? More
                than 54,000 people are now waiting for operations, and many are
                worried about how long it will be before they are treated.
                Members have rightly spoken about the level of human suffering
                that lies behind the statistics. I was particularly glad to hear
                so many Members calling for better resources as a practical
                means of ensuring that services are adequately geared to provide
                the level of service necessary to meet the needs of our
                community. The availability of adequate funding is a key element
                in reducing waiting lists, although as I stated yesterday, and
                state again today, there is an allied question of management,
                which we will also address.</p>
                <p>Although this debate is focused on waiting lists, the
                underlying problems are much broader. Waiting lists are in some
                ways like a barometer registering the overall levels of pressure
                on our health and social services. The current high waiting
                lists reflect both the pressures on our services’ overall
                capacity and a continuing growth in emergency admissions. It is
                not easy to find a single cause for this. One factor is
                undoubtedly our ageing population; another factor may be
                advances in medicine that offer new therapies for previously
                untreatable conditions. This makes it likely that people can
                avail of services that were not previously available.</p>
                <p>However, this year in the Eastern Health and Social Services
                Board, medical activity in hospitals has increased by 9%.
                Increases of this magnitude are difficult to meet, and
                year-round trolley waits are becoming a fact of life in too many
                hospitals. The system is simply running too close to full
                capacity. Increased waiting lists are one symptom of a service
                that was grossly underfunded in the past. It will take some
                time, and a great deal of money, to address that problem. I am
                glad to see that Members have recognised this and made
                references to the effect that small, or temporary, changes in
                staffing levels or capacity in any given speciality can have. I
                am also grateful for their comments regarding historic funding
                decisions.</p>
                <p>Members have also drawn attention to the situation beyond our
                hospitals. That is of equal concern. People, many of them
                elderly, are waiting at home for the support needed to maintain
                their independence and quality of life. Without prompt and
                appropriate assistance, some of these people will end up in
                hospital. There will be a delay in returning people to the
                community after hospital care because the services are not in
                place to support them, and that is equally worrying.</p>
                <p>Since becoming Minister of Health, Social Services and Public
                Safety I have brought this situation to the attention of the
                Assembly and sought its support in tackling the underlying
                problems that face health and social services. Since December
                1999 the Executive have found some additional funding for these
                vital services. However, in order to turn the corner, a
                sustained increase in funding over a number of years is
                required. The service faces some difficult choices this year.
                The additional resources in this year’s Budget fall far short
                of the bids that I submitted, as a number of Members,
                particularly those on the Health and Social Services Committee,
                have drawn out.</p>
                <p>To make a lasting impact on waiting lists we must address the
                issue of capacity in hospital and community services. Given the
                current financial climate, I am greatly concerned — and I note
                that Committee members share that concern — that I will not
                receive the level of resources needed to bring about
                improvements. The situation will worsen without these resources.
                I am aware that the Health Service can do, and is doing, a great
                deal to cut waste and to operate with maximum efficiency. I
                support such action.</p>
                <p>Last September I issued a comprehensive framework for action
                on waiting lists to improve the process. That was the first
                long-term strategic approach to dealing with waiting lists here.
                Previous reductions in waiting lists were not sustained because
                recurrent investment was not forthcoming. I want a sustained
                programme of action over a number of years to deliver long-term
                improvements. We need that sustained and long-term action,
                supported by recurrent resources, to boost service capacity and
                to reduce waiting lists.</p>
                <p>I have put in place the necessary framework, but there is
                still a long way to go. I am glad to say that it has been
                possible to allocate some additional funding to reduce waiting
                lists. In the current year, for instance, I have been able to
                allocate an extra £3 million for specific action on waiting
                lists. In addition, last year’s non-recurrent allocation of
                £5 million was made recurrent, thus increasing to £8 million
                the total additional resources available for action on waiting
                lists this year.</p>
                <p>Following the June monitoring round, I also made available to
                the service an extra several million pounds to strengthen
                community infrastructure and services. Although that money is
                welcome, the service needs more overall investment if it is to
                meet the demands placed on it. Those demands have been clearly
                illustrated by the very graphic personal stories that Members
                have today related on behalf of their constituents.</p>
                <p>To make the required impact on waiting lists and waiting
                times, we must address the shortage of acute hospital capacity,
                particularly at peak periods. We must also deal with the under-resourcing
                of community care services. Against that backdrop, however,
                there are some rays of hope. Boards and trusts are implementing
                a wide range of measures to improve the management of hospital
                admissions and discharges. Every board has devised a
                comprehensive action plan to address necessary measures, and a
                great deal of work is being done.</p>
                <p>For example, an additional 60 opthalmology patients have been
                treated as day cases in the Mater Hospital — patients who
                would otherwise have had to wait for treatment elsewhere. More
                than 200 patients have been treated in ward 8 of the Royal
                Victoria Hospital under an initiative by which the ward is used
                as an elective surgery ward for six months per year and as an
                emergency admissions ward for the rest of the year.</p>
                <p>Many hundreds of people have been offered the opportunity to
                receive their treatment at a more distant hospital rather than
                continue to wait. The Eastern Health and Social Services Board
                has contacted 300 people on long waiting lists to offer them
                early treatment at Downe Hospital.</p>
                <p>Additional cardiac surgery operations have been provided for
                patients who have agreed to travel to Glasgow rather than wait
                for treatment locally. A new angiography facility due to open
                soon at Altnagelvin Hospital will increase overall capacity for
                diagnostic testing of that nature and will help to reduce
                waiting times. Mobile MRI scanners operating from several
                locations have reduced waiting lists. I have also allocated
                additional funding for new supernumerary nursing posts in
                cardiac intensive care to support the existing staff, and to
                allow more nurses to get the specialised training that is
                needed. That will help to increase bed capacity and the number
                of operations carried out.</p>
                <p>Some Members commented on the structures and organisation of
                the Health Service and the forthcoming review of public
                administration; they mentioned that those matters were dealt
                with by the Acute Hospitals Review Group. As Members know, I
                have issued a report, and consultation on it will last until 31
                October. That consultation will provide the initial information
                and reaction that will help me to formulate proposals, which I
                will then discuss with my Executive Colleagues. I encourage
                Members, and all those with an interest in health and social
                services, to respond to the consultation.</p>
                <p>Members commented on the need for overall efficiency in the
                service. Despite the fact that since the early 1980s the
                equivalent of £190 million, in today’s terms, has been
                removed from the Health Service’s baseline budget, it has
                treated almost 10% more patients in the last five years. During
                that time, there has been a 27% increase in the number of
                community care packages. In addition, the service plans to
                achieve savings of £12 million by the end of 2002-03 through a
                range of improvements, including a review of acute sector
                performance, improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of
                prescribing, improved waiting list management, improved bed
                management and further rationalisation of the Health Service
                estate.</p>
                <i>
                <p>3.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p>We heard about difficulties specifically in relation to our
                ageing population. Kieran McCarthy was worried about
                discrimination on age grounds. I fully accept that there must be
                no discrimination on the grounds of age, gender or any other
                such factor. All of our services are covered by equality
                legislation. That means that we are bound in law to ensure that
                all patients are treated fairly, and that is what I would expect
                to happen.</p>
                <p>Eddie McGrady talked about co-operation with the South, and I
                am very keen to encourage the services in the North and the
                South to work together. I hope that the work already undertaken
                by CAWT (Co-operation and Working Together for Health Gain and
                Well-being in Border Areas) can be built upon.</p>
                <p>Dr Adamson and some other Members asked about the use of
                services in other countries. I am happy, in principle, to draw
                on services available elsewhere in the interests of our
                patients. We already make very good use of services in Glasgow,
                London, Dublin and other centres, as part of the overall
                services available to patients. There is, as Dr Adamson pointed
                out, the issue of how that draws money into the overall
                financial resources available elsewhere as opposed to here.
                However, we want to establish an appropriate balance and to
                ensure that the services that people need are accessible and
                readily available.</p>
                <p>Eddie McGrady talked about decentralising services to make
                capacity available. I am very committed to using all of our
                capacity to its fullest effect. That is evidenced by the
                increased use of hospitals such as Lagan Valley Hospital to help
                tackle waiting lists in hospitals such as Craigavon Area
                Hospital. We are also now making better use of day facilities at
                South Tyrone Hospital with ophthalmology cases receiving
                treatment there. I am conscious of the difficulty of the
                availability of expert staff, and we need to be careful to avoid
                creating staffing problems in other centres.</p>
                <p>A range of specific measures has been introduced to deal with
                the difficulties in fracture services. The Royal Group of
                Hospitals Trust and the Green Park Healthcare Trust have put on
                additional theatre lists. Additional day cases have been taken
                at the Ulster Hospital. Fracture lists at the Royal Victoria
                Hospital have been protected, and I am monitoring the situation
                very closely. There is a shortage of orthopaedic surgeons both
                here and in the overall NHS, and we are taking steps to increase
                the number of trainees in the speciality, although that will
                obviously take time. We have also recently dealt with a
                difficulty relating to the number of theatre nurses.</p>
                <p>I was very grateful to Monica McWilliams for the points that
                she raised about collective responsibility. It was a very
                thoughtful contribution, which we need to keep in mind. Prof
                McWilliams also asked whether 39,000 is a realistic target, and
                I believe that it is not unless there is a substantial recurring
                investment in service capacity and in staff. I have repeatedly
                emphasised that reducing waiting lists will require a sustained
                effort over a number of years.</p>
                <p>Carmel Hanna told the House that 47% of the rise occurred in
                the last quarter. Both she and Monica McWilliams talked about
                the last quarter and the factors involved. Some 60% of the
                increase in the last quarter — therefore some 60% the figure
                that Carmel Hanna told us was such a large part of the overall
                figure — was in the ear, nose and throat speciality. That
                increase can therefore largely be explained by the delays in
                some operations due to the directive to use single-use
                instruments for tonsillectomies. There were also some delays
                caused by the absence of key consultancy staff through illness,
                and others as a result of patients being transferred to the
                Causeway Hospital. Those last two factors were temporary and
                should be overcome quickly — the former less so.</p>
                <p>Outpatient waiting lists increased due to an apparent
                across-the-board surge in numbers being referred to outpatient
                services.</p>
                <b>
                <p>Madam Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p>I ask the Minister to bring her remarks to a close.</p>
                <b>
                <p>Ms de Brún:</p>
                </b>
                <p>I recognise these difficulties. When I issued the ‘Framework
                for Action on Waiting Lists’ last year, I said that only
                long-term focused management action, coupled with new investment
                in the service, would improve the waiting list situation.</p>
                <p>I have set a long-term programme of work in motion to ensure
                that the Health Service makes the best use of what it has and
                that efficiency is improved where possible. I look to the
                Assembly and my ministerial Colleagues to recognise the pressing
                need and to agree to put in place the funding necessary to
                ensure that health and community services are adequately
                resourced so that we can meet the challenges facing us in the
                years ahead.</p>
                <b>
                <p>Mr McGrady:</p>
                </b>
                <p>I thank all Members who participated in the debate, and
                particularly the Minister for the time that she has given to
                this problem and the detailed response that she gave in the past
                16 minutes. She will undoubtedly agree that it will take some
                time for the lay person to digest all that she has said, and I
                am sure she will understand that I do not have the capacity to
                reply to all aspects of her response.</p>
                <i>
                <p>(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr McClelland] in the Chair)</p>
                </i>
                <p>The main thrusts of the motion enable the Assembly to
                consider its collective concerns, and its view that immediate
                action is required. Those are the two important themes —
                Members’ concerns about representing community concerns, and
                their concerted action with, it is hoped, the Departments to
                bring about an improvement in the situation.</p>
                <p>There were 15 valuable contributions made this afternoon, and
                it is impossible for me to reply to them all as the Minister has
                done. However, they had some common themes. The matter of
                additional funding arose in many contributions. The structures
                through which the Health Service delivers were strongly
                criticised for being ineffectual and inefficient. There was an
                underlying theme that no matter how much money is thrown at the
                problem, it will not change unless the Assembly does something
                urgent and dramatic. No Member said that, but that is the
                feeling one got from many of the contributions.</p>
                <p>Many Members also referred to the enormous debt of gratitude
                owed to the medical fraternity, nursing and ancillary staff. Not
                only do they deserve credit for what they are doing, but they
                should be doubly credited for doing it under conditions that we
                have allowed to be imposed upon them.</p>
                <p>Ultimately it is the patients who suffer the prolonged and
                unnecessary pain that I referred to in my introductory remarks.
                Sometimes that pain can lead to premature death, and that is
                what Members must strive to avoid.</p>
                <p>I have three pages of notes that I intended to use for my
                response, but I have given up the prospect of doing so. However,
                I will nail a remark that was made by Ms McWilliams. I did not
                come here to bash, or gang up on, the Minister. I came here
                because my representative role gives me the responsibility of
                articulating people’s concerns. I doubly resent Ms McWilliams’s
                insinuation because, metaphorically speaking, she waded in in
                her pinstripe wellingtons to a debate to which she had not heard
                the introduction. The thrust of my introduction was not to bash
                the Minister. The thrust of my introduction was that finances
                are needed and we must ensure that that need is properly
                addressed. In addition, I would point out that the
                &quot;delicate flower&quot; of ministerial responsibility can
                well defend herself.</p>
                <p>Undoubtedly the crisis with hospital and medical waiting
                lists is not solely about money, and I have said that time after
                time. Mismanagement of resources has been endemic for a long
                time, not just during the past three years but for longer than
                that. I have asked the Minister to address that problem.</p>
                <p>In the Assembly on 17 October 2000, Minister Durkan, speaking
                about the Budget, said:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p>&quot;In the Department of Health, Social Services and Public
                Safety, the budget will grow by over £150 million (or 7·2%) to
                some £2·3 billion. Within this total, over £1·16 billion
                will be available for hospital and community health services,
                and £460 million will be available for personal social
                services.</p>
                <p>Additional provision is also being made to address winter
                pressures and waiting lists, while family health services show
                an increase in funding of over 8%.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p>Even with the additional money, we still have a spiralling
                waiting list. We must find out if the cause is inefficient
                spending, misallocation or a lack of funds. I doubt if it is a
                lack of funds.</p>
                <p>In November 2000, an extra £17 million — £5 million of
                which was carried over — was allocated to the health services.
                In January this year £14·5 million was given to the health
                services. In February 2001, £18 million of additional spending
                was injected into the health services. These are vast amounts of
                money. The figure of £18 million had been analysed by the
                Department of Finance and Personnel and by the Department of
                Health, Social Services and Public Safety as being required. If
                the Departments made an assessment of what was required, they
                got it. Where are the funds going? Why are they not having the
                desired effect? It is important to remember that a further £8
                million has been allocated for this year, specifically to reduce
                waiting lists.</p>
                <p>Seven months have passed since the interdepartmental
                consultation study and review of the consequences of trust
                deficiencies were put in place. What progress has been made? Is
                it near completion, and have any conclusions been reached? These
                are urgent matters that require urgent answers.</p>
                <p>There is an absence of decision making. We have consultation
                fatigue; we have &quot;paralysis by analysis&quot;. No decisions
                have been made, and everything is under review. However, the
                Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety is not
                alone in being in this situation. Reviews are being conducted in
                almost every Department, and reviews of reviews. It goes on and
                on.</p>
                <p>Decisions are needed about primary care, acute care and the
                administrative structure of the health services. There is almost
                universal agreement today that there are too many trusts —19
                for a population the size of Birmingham. The situation is
                ludicrous, and we cannot wait for reviews of public
                administration.</p>
                <p>There is a lack of co-ordination. Why is Northern Ireland the
                only part of these isles that has not carried out an audit on
                the reasons for the waiting lists? An audit could tell us what
                factors are contributing to the waiting lists, and also whether
                money is being spent wisely or if a bucketful more money is
                needed. At least we would know what is happening.</p>
                <p>I will finish on a parochial note. Last night in my home town
                five patients were lying all night in the corridors of the Downe
                Hospital. That is the epitome. Endemic centralisation should be
                reversed rapidly, and we should make use of what already exists
                and enhance it. Surely that is the way forward.</p>
                <p>I am not here on a bashing exercise, nor am I here on a
                political platform. I am here, along with my Assembly
                Colleagues, to say that the Minister, fortunately or
                unfortunately, has responsibility for the health services. We
                look to her to address these issues. We plead with her, and we
                will back her in any way we can, to ensure that the waiting
                lists that are literally killing people are reduced as soon as
                possible.</p>

                <p>That this Assembly deplores the ongoing catalogue of
                paramilitary activity particularly from groups which are
                allegedly on ceasefire and which claim to accept the premise
                that only those committed to the use of exclusively peaceful and
                democratic means can participate in government in Northern
                Ireland; and further determines it is inconsistent and
                intolerable that any party associated with active terrorism
                continues to hold Executive positions.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p>I am mindful that this is possibly the last debate on the
                last day — at least before suspension, perhaps even for all
                time — of the Assembly. None the less, it is vital that the
                issue be dealt with before the close of business of the Northern
                Ireland Assembly. The Assembly has been dogged by the issue
                since its inception, which is no small part of the reason why it
                faces its present problems.</p>
                <p>I consider it a reasonably effortless task to show the
                Assembly that each of the main paramilitary organisations has
                violated the terms of its ceasefire. My task is even simpler,
                because I do not confine myself to their definition of a
                ceasefire. Rather, I will use the definition that is set down in
                law — namely, that parties associated with paramilitary groups
                and all others must show that they are committed to exclusively
                peaceful and democratic means. There are still some in this
                community — even after all these years — who refuse to face
                the reality of the violence in our midst. They still hold on to
                the illusion of a peace process, shutting their eyes to the
                violence that surrounds them. When they are pushed to come to
                terms with breaches of the ceasefires, we hear the hypocritical
                cant that &quot;it’s better than it was 10 years ago&quot;. It
                follows that we are to be grateful to the terrorists for
                adjusting the nature and level of their terrorism. Setting for a
                lower level of terrorism may have led to an improvement on the
                streets, but that does not amount to peace, nor does it justify
                providing seats in Government for those who are still actively
                engaged in terrorism.</p>
                <p>There are others who — almost convincingly — advise us
                that we are coming out of a long and sustained period of
                violence and that we cannot expect an unblemished record in
                those circumstances. They tell us that terrorism is in its death
                throes. That is nonsense; we must look at what is happening. We
                must face the fact that terrorism in Northern Ireland is
                cranking up — it is not winding down. Moreover, there are
                those at the head of Government and of policing who refuse to
                point the finger at the paramilitary organisations involved.
                They tell us that the act was probably carried out by dissident
                groups; they tell us that the police are still investigating the
                incident; they tell us that we have to consider it in the round;
                and they tell us that it may be the activity of mavericks, not
                sanctioned by the organisations themselves. Almost any excuse is
                made for such terrorist activity.</p>
                <p>For some in the political world, the highest legal standard
                of proof and evidence is required before an organisation can be
                blamed for anything. Yet, it seems that they do not require the
                same high legal standard for infractions perpetrated by
                &quot;the other side&quot;. I suspect that even an admission
                from the terrorist organisations would not cause those people to
                act as if those organisations had been in breach.</p>
                <p>There are some in this community who, when their colleagues
                carry out their terrorist activities — in violation of the
                declared ceasefires of those organisations — and are arrested,
                demand a higher legal standard of proof and evidence. Indeed,
                those people demand more human rights for the terrorists than
                the terrorists themselves accord when they wear balaclavas and
                meet their victims in the backstreets of Belfast and other
                cities and towns in Northern Ireland. That is the reality.</p>
                <p>Some things become obvious when we look at the breaches of
                the ceasefires and the catalogue of incidents. The first is that
                the failure of the exclusion mechanism has given the IRA the
                message that it can — literally — get away with murder. The
                failure to hold Sinn Féin/IRA to account and to remove it from
                government has shown that there are parties in the House that
                are afraid of the consequences of the safeguards that they
                signed up to in the Belfast Agreement.</p>
                <p>Events have also shown that the legislation was not only
                ineffective, but incomplete. Members had an instrument with
                which to punish Sinn Féin/IRA, had they chosen to use it.
                However, there was no mechanism to deal with parties that were
                not in government if the paramilitary group with which they were
                associated breached its ceasefire, especially if they were not
                in the Assembly itself.</p>
                <p>Because of the higher standard required for participation in
                government, the failure to deal with Sinn Féin/IRA has been the
                central problem. The SDLP, and even the Ulster Unionist Party,
                must take the rap. Both parties have failed to vote on the
                violations of the IRA ceasefire during all the years of this
                Assembly. The greatest difficulty — particularly for Ulster
                Unionists — is that they went through the referendum telling
                the people of Northern Ireland that they had the issue covered
                and that, no matter what Sinn Féin/IRA might do, they would get
                it thrown out of the Executive, if it turned to violence.
                Moreover, they convinced some people in Northern Ireland that
                they had a belt-and- braces provision. If the SDLP did not
                answer the call and fulfil an explicit commitment in the
                agreement by throwing Sinn Féin out, the leader of the Ulster
                Unionist Party had a letter from the Prime Minister.</p>
                <p>The letter said that if those measures proved to be
                ineffective, the Prime Minister would propose some changes. Many
                of us said that the letter meant only that such changes would be
                proposed to co-signatories to the agreement. If two of the
                parties to the agreement had already refused to comply, it was
                unlikely that they would agree with any proposal that the Prime
                Minister might make. The weakness of the Ulster Unionist Party
                is that it has never actually triggered that mechanism. The
                party never voted to exclude Sinn Féin and thereby test the
                Prime Minister on whether he would propose a provision that
                would ensure that those who were engaged in violence would be
                excluded from government.</p>
                <p>Why has there been no action against Sinn Féin/IRA? Is the
                case for exclusion marginal? Is there a shortage of evidence?
                That is not the case.</p>
                <p>First, the loyalist paramilitaries, who receive less
                attention in the House on this issue, because they are not in
                government have indisputably breached their ceasefires. That was
                seen most graphically and tragically when the two organisations
                went to war with each other. Hundreds of so-called punishment
                shootings and beatings have been carried out by both Loyalist
                paramilitary groups. Given the frequency and the geographical
                pattern of the attacks and the co-ordination required, all one’s
                intelligence, judgement and senses would have to be suspended
                for one to believe that the ongoing attacks on Roman Catholic
                homes with pipe bombs and other missiles were the work of
                anything other than a major Loyalist paramilitary group.
                Equally, the bomb left in Ballycastle could not conceivably be
                the work of anyone other than a member of one of those
                paramilitary organisations. Those attacks must be condemned
                without any verbal or mental reservation.</p>
                <p>It is a sick irony that the groups responsible were among the
                most enthusiastic advocates of the so-called peace process and
                the Belfast Agreement. That the behaviour of Loyalist
                paramilitary groups does not directly impact on the functioning
                of government has meant that they are under less scrutiny and, I
                suggest, less pressure than their violent acts deserve.</p>
                <p>What should we make of the behaviour of Sinn Féin/IRA? They
                have representatives in government and are bound by the terms of
                the Belfast Agreement and the Northern Ireland Act 1998 to
                employ exclusively democratic and peaceful means of effecting
                change. They broke their first ceasefire and re-engaged in a
                campaign of bombing and shooting, murder and carnage. Even while
                signing up to the Belfast Agreement, they were involved in the
                planning of the massive bomb attack on London. That shows their
                sincerity.</p>
                <p>Since the reinstatement of their ceasefire on 20 July 1997,
                the IRA has been responsible for 170 so-called punishment
                shootings and 250 paramilitary beatings. In July 1997, the IRA
                was involved in the preparation of a major robbery in the
                Republic of Ireland. Provos were arrested while staking out the
                Allied Irish Bank headquarters in Dublin. In January 1998, the
                IRA murdered a well-known Loyalist, Jim Guiney. He was gunned
                down in his carpet shop in Dunmurry. In February 1998, the IRA
                murdered 38-year-old Loyalist Robert Dougan, again in Dunmurry.
                In February 1998, the IRA, using its DAAD cover name, murdered
                Brendan Campbell. They claimed that he was a leading drug
                dealer. In July 1998, 33-year-old Andrew Kearney from New Lodge
                in north Belfast was shot by the IRA. After the shooting, they
                jammed the lifts, and he bled to death. It transpired that Mr
                Kearney had been shot because he had got the better of a local
                IRA hero in a fight.</p>
                <p>In January 1999, author and former IRA man turned informer
                Eamon Collins was beaten to death by the IRA in Newry, County
                Down. In May 1999, the IRA murdered Brendan ‘Speedy’ Fegan.
                They again justified their action by claiming that he was a
                leading drugs dealer. They shot him dead in a bar in Newry. In
                June 1999, the IRA murdered Paul Downey. Once again, they
                claimed that he had been a prominent drugs dealer. In June 1999,
                Martin McGartland, an RUC agent who infiltrated the IRA,
                narrowly escaped with his life after being shot in Whitley Bay,
                Northumbria, by IRA members. I have a copy of a letter sent to
                Mr McGartland by Northumbria police. It shows that they had
                arrested Henry Fitzsimmons and Scott Gary Monaghan, two well
                known Provisional IRA members, and that they were regarded as
                responsible for the attempt to kill Martin McGartland. However,
                even with all of that evidence, the Secretary of State
                considered that in the round there had been no breach of the IRA
                ceasefire or the terms of the Belfast Agreement.</p>
                <i>
                <p>4.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p>In July 1999, the IRA abducted and murdered Charles Bennett,
                a New Lodge man. Also in July, the men arrested, and convicted
                in connection with the importation of arms from Florida were
                shown to be members of the Provisional IRA. It was proven that
                that activity was sanctioned at the highest level of the
                Provisional IRA. I will come back to that issue in my winding-up
                speech. Clearly, those men were members of the Provisional IRA.
                On the Noraid Internet site, they are described as IRA prisoners
                in an American jail. An article in ‘GQ’ magazine shows
                clearly the links between the Provisional IRA and those who were
                arrested, and asserts that they were part of an IRA gun running
                escapade. It is interesting that that activity was being planned
                at the same time as the organisation’s representatives were
                sitting down with Senator George Mitchell and telling him how
                sincere they were about trying to achieve progress on
                decommissioning. While they were telling the senator that they
                were serious about decommissioning, they were importing guns
                from the United States to increase their stockpile of weaponry.</p>
                <p>In August 1999, the IRA deported five men from Dungannon and
                one from Belfast for what they judged to be antisocial
                behaviour. I suppose that they consider their murdering and
                gunrunning to be civil and convivial. In October 2000, the IRA
                murdered Real IRA man, Joe O’Connor, in Ballymurphy, west
                Belfast. In April 2001, the IRA used the usual excuse of drug
                dealing to justify murdering Christopher O’Kane in
                Londonderry. In May 2001, the IRA again murdered someone who, it
                claimed, was a drug dealer. The victim, that time, was Paul Daly
                from Belfast. He was shot in front of his family.</p>
                <p>In April 2001, Londonderry man, Gerald McFadden, from Rathlin
                Gardens in the Creggan estate was charged after he was found to
                have personal details of senior RUC officers. He has since been
                convicted of that offence. That demonstrates that the IRA was
                engaged in the targeting of RUC officers and that, once again,
                it was in contravention of the explicit requirement to use only
                peaceful and democratic means. In June 2001, the Provisional IRA
                raided Belfast docks and stole about £4 million. Also in June
                2001, the IRA raided the house of an arms dealer in Athlone,
                County Westmeath. The attackers threatened him, tied up his wife
                and children, and stole over 100 shotguns, rifles and a quantity
                of ammunition.</p>
                <p>In August 2001 came Colombia, another effort by the
                Provisional IRA to secure the peace process. I will deal with
                that issue in my winding-up speech. That was an added
                embarrassment for Sinn Féin, because all three men involved had
                party connections. According to the Government of their friend,
                Fidel Castro — to whom Mr Adams is soon going out to talk —
                one of the men, Connolly, was the accredited representative of
                Sinn Féin in Cuba and, no doubt, in South America. I have said
                James Monaghan was on the brigade staff at the headquarters of
                the Provisional IRA. He is their well-known chief engineer and
                bomb maker. Such an individual would not have been a freelancer;
                he was on a mission sanctioned by the so-called Army Council of
                the Provisional IRA. They tried to tell us that those boys were
                really on holiday. I can think of more attractive places in
                which to holiday than the malaria-stricken jungles, where the
                opportunities for the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC)
                to kidnap or kill must be greater than anywhere else in the
                world. Clearly, the Provisional IRA, at the very highest level,
                sanctioned that mission.</p>
                <p>I cannot say anything about the arrest of IRA leader, Eddie
                Copeland, in north Belfast, as the matter is before the courts.
                I could have spoken of many other IRA failures to maintain its
                ceasefire. One wonders, after hearing that catalogue of events,
                what the IRA must do before the House imposes sanctions on Sinn
                Féin/IRA. I hope, in what may be the last act before the
                suspension of the Assembly, that the House will not again dodge
                the issue and that it will support the motion.</p>

                <p>&quot;and calls on all parties who profess to be committed to
                exclusively peaceful and democratic means to unequivocally
                repudiate any and all such violence and to call on all
                paramilitary groups to give real effect to the decommissioning
                provisions of the Good Friday Agreement.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p>If we — and certain illegal organisations — so choose,
                the events of the past summer can enable us to deal conclusively
                with illegal weapons on this island. If some fail to choose that
                option, they will be failing to acknowledge and accept the
                impact of the still unfolding events of recent days in the
                United States, Latin America, Ireland and in the communities
                that we represent. If some fail to choose that option, they will
                miss the beat of the people of this part of the world. They will
                also miss the opportunity to contribute meaningfully to events
                in other parts of the world. Decommissioning would confirm that
                we are moving beyond conflict at a time when others seem to be
                moving towards greater conflict.</p>
                <p>All of us have, or should have, real concerns about the
                conduct of more than one, or indeed all, of the illegal
                paramilitary groups that are still active on this island. The
                attitude of some inside and outside the Chamber to illegal
                organisations now and in the past has been informed by their
                worst fears. That is a valid and genuine perspective, but it is
                one that paramilitary organisations and their advocates dismiss
                with the ritual recitation that &quot;the guns are silent&quot;.
                That is not always the case, and that is not their only
                obligation. If the worst has been done to someone’s family or
                community by an illegal organisation, their fears will inform
                their judgements about the nature and intentions of that
                organisation. If evidence exists that discredits that
                organisation’s claims, mistrust will prosper. That is not to
                give succour to leaders who alarm their communities or
                constituencies; I say that to acknowledge the real anxiety in
                those communities about their future on an island that is
                changing enormously but which contains illegal organisations
                which, they feel, have not changed enough.</p>
                <p>There are others inside and outside the Chamber who have
                experienced the realisation of their worst fears in the years of
                violent conflict and who have consciously sought to allow their
                judgements about illegal organisations to be informed a little
                more by their best hopes. Others have attempted to understand
                the transition that those organisations and those associated
                with them have tried to make from unambiguous support for armed
                struggle to exclusively peaceful and democratic means of
                conducting political affairs. That is a difficult political and
                moral line to walk. It becomes longer and more difficult to walk
                when evidence emerges that organisations have acted in a way
                that is contrary to a commitment to exclusively peaceful and
                democratic means of conducting political affairs. That is the
                context for those of us who have expressed and maintained
                confidence in the ceasefires of various organisations.</p>
                <p>Contexts and politics change. Today the context is the
                unfolding events of recent weeks and months, set against the
                backdrop of the uncertain and difficult years since the Good
                Friday Agreement. The new context and the continuing doubts
                about, and dangers to, the agreement now require a further
                response. If illegal organisations do not acknowledge the impact
                of recent threats and terror in the North on our political
                situation, or the mistrust arising from events in Latin America,
                or the parallels and consequences of attacks on commercial,
                civilian and military targets at home or abroad, recently or in
                the past, they will contribute to an environment wherein the
                worst fears can gather and the best intentions can fracture.</p>
                <p>To rehearse tired and tested responses to the need to put
                weapons verifiably and completely beyond use, without
                appreciating the changed and changing local and international
                environment and the extent of the investment in the Good Friday
                Agreement, is to ignore unfolding events. If any political party
                professing commitment to exclusively peaceful and democratic
                means fails to repudiate unequivocally violence, it contributes
                to the environment wherein worst fears inform, not merely the
                judgement of political leaders, but the judgement of the wider
                community.</p>
                <p>There has been ambiguity about sectarian attacks and
                evasiveness about events in Latin America. There have been
                parades with ranks of people in balaclavas and articulation of
                the grievances of one community, coupled with silence about the
                grievances of the other. None of that aids the resolution of the
                issue of illegal weapons, nor does saying — rightly — that
                our best response to events in America is to make our agreement
                work, while failing to recognise that illegal organisations and
                their past or present conspiracies and actions, at home or
                abroad, are at the heart of the threat to that agreement.</p>
                <p>The UDA and UFF ceasefire does not exist in any meaningful
                way. The six UDA and UFF commanders are not likely to meet and
                declare their ceasefire over, but in at least half of their
                command areas, and in more than half of their areas of
                influence, the ceasefire has been breached — and that breach
                is systemic, to borrow the words of the Secretary of State. The
                situation requires both political and security responses. First,
                the UDA should be made aware that in the event of its ceasefire
                being redesignated, all its command areas will be affected.
                Secondly, the full weight of the law should be brought to bear
                on those persons — on licence or not — involved in threat or
                terror, particularly those directing the operations of the UDA
                and the UFF. The police must be — and be seen to be — more
                interventionist in bringing the full force of the law to bear on
                those carrying out activities that are anti-Catholic,
                anti-Nationalist, anti- agreement and anti-change.</p>
                <p>Yesterday, with regard to the IRA ceasefire, John Hume said:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p>&quot;Given the current international atmospheres, could I
                say directly to Sinn Féin please do all that you have to do now
                and all that you actually can do by taking the necessary actions
                to ensure that all weapons are put completely beyond use&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p>That was a request to respond to the particular circumstances
                of this week. It should be heeded. The IRA will make a
                monumental error of judgement if it concludes that if it hunkers
                down and keeps its head down, events will pass it by, and people
                will return to it on more tolerable terms than might otherwise
                be the case. The IRA will commit a further error of judgement if
                it concludes that its engagement with the de Chastelain
                commission is an adequate or convincing response to that
                requirement.</p>
                <i>
                <p>4.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p>Although the media and the political leadership has its
                doubts, and the world sees the issue of terror more
                single-mindedly than before, the IRA may think that that will
                pass and that people will support the movement again. It may
                conclude that such isolation will be much as it was in the past:
                the IRA has been there, done that, survived it and come back
                stronger. If that is what the IRA concludes, it will have
                misread the shifts on this island and elsewhere. The sooner that
                that is recognised, the better it will be for the agreement, for
                all our citizens and for all of us who are responding creatively
                and purposefully to the unfolding events in a world that is
                smaller, more intimate and more familiar — but also more
                vulnerable — than at any time in history.</p>
                <p>Some will refer to a series of real or alleged breaches of
                the Good Friday Agreement and failures of implementation to
                explain why weapons have not been put completely and verifiably
                beyond use. The Unionist political leadership will be blamed for
                its failure to lead. There is some truth in that, but it ignores
                the wider unease in pro-agreement unionism about the IRA’s
                intentions.</p>

                <p>Mr Trimble:</p>
                </b>
                <p>When he moved the motion, Mr Robinson made it clear that it
                was directed against all paramilitaries, and I was glad to hear
                his condemnation of Loyalist violence. Although there are
                reasons to focus on the Republican movement’s activities, this
                side of the House should make its condemnation of Loyalist
                violence clear.</p>
                <p>The motion refers to a commitment to exclusively peaceful and
                democratic means, which is one of the fundamental principles of
                the agreement. Two words that are used in the motion are also
                significant: &quot;inconsistent&quot; and
                &quot;intolerant&quot;. It is asserted that violent activity is
                inconsistent with a commitment to peaceful means and to holding
                office. The motion is absolutely right in principle.</p>
                <p>I made it clear in my first speech to the Assembly in July
                1998 that those who signed up to the agreement and its
                implementation would give people the opportunity to change. I
                shall not quote everything that I said, but I recall that I said
                that if people had a past it did not mean that they could not
                have a future. However, they were required to demonstrate
                change. I have returned to that point many times since, most
                recently in December 2000, when I said that there could not be a
                moral vacuum at the heart of the process.</p>
                <p>We are engaged in a transition, and in the course of that
                transition we will hold people to the promises that they have
                made. I have held the Republican movement to its promises, and
                it was because Republicans failed to implement their promises
                that I imposed sanctions on them, first by preventing their
                attendance at North/South Ministerial Council meetings, and
                secondly by triggering the present crisis through my
                resignation.</p>
                <p>The Ulster Unionist Party has been clear about the
                principles. We have given people opportunities, but
                opportunities are also a challenge. I say to the Republican
                movement as firmly as I can that there has been a litany of
                Republican activities over the past few years, as Mr Robinson
                laboriously set out, culminating in what did happen and what may
                have happened in Colombia. Those events, the Republican movement’s
                reaction to them and its failure to deal with them have
                destroyed its credibility. That does not mean that the situation
                is irretrievable. However, for the situation to be retrieved,
                the Republican movement must move urgently to rebuild that
                credibility. It must do that now, quickly and convincingly.</p>
                <p>It would be intolerable for the present situation to continue
                indefinitely — indeed, it will not. As Mr Robinson noted, this
                might well be the last time that we debate this issue in the
                Assembly. It may well be that, come this weekend, the Sinn Féin
                Ministers will be turned out of office. Unfortunately, others
                will suffer the same fate. If that happens, it will not be
                because of this motion, or because of any posturing — it will
                happen because of the actions that my Colleagues and I have
                taken. Also, to be fair, it will happen because Tony Blair did
                effect change. Reference was made to his promise to propose
                change. He went further; he made changes, and they will take
                effect this weekend unless certain things are done by
                Republicans.</p>
                <p>The amendment is worthy of consideration. It challenges
                paramilitaries to give real effect to the decommissioning
                provisions of the agreement. I welcome the amendment because it
                is important that that challenge be put. Consequently, my
                Colleagues and I will support the amendment. If the amendment
                fails, we will support the original motion. At this stage, it is
                important that we concentrate on what has to be done and what
                people should do — even if there is not that much prospect of
                its happening. As a result of that, other action will be taken
                in the next few days and weeks.</p>

                settlement.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p>That is the agreement that Sinn Féin is wedded to. Sinn
                Féin is absolutely committed to resolving our conflict by
                democratic and peaceful means. There is a collective
                responsibility on all parties to the agreement to resolve the
                issues, and Sinn Féin has told the Governments and other
                parties to go back and read the agreement. I note the telling
                omission of any recognition of this salient reality from the
                amendment, so I remind the SDLP of that fact once again. Of
                course, Mr Trimble has constantly misrepresented the agreement
                on this matter. It is of particular regret that the SDLP, by
                this ill- conceived amendment, has today given credence to that
                — perhaps inadvertently, perhaps because it is still reacting
                to recent election results, or because it is preoccupied with
                internal party matters.</p>
                <p>This year, Loyalists have carried out over 200 bomb attacks
                on Catholic homes, businesses and churches. Loyalists have shot
                dead two young men in recent weeks and have created a blockade
                to prevent Catholic primary school children from going to school
                in north Belfast. Last weekend, Loyalist murder gangs again
                attempted to kill Catholics. If the process is to succeed, the
                two Governments and all the parties that signed the agreement
                must defend the agreement. It is the template for dealing with
                the matters that still need to be resolved as part of the
                conflict resolution process, including the issue of arms.</p>
                <p>Under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement the British
                Government are committed to delivering on several key issues,
                including the creation of a representative policing service that
                is fully accountable for its actions and free from partisan,
                political control, a fair and impartial system of justice,
                effective structures to safeguard human rights, economic,
                social, cultural and political equality and the demilitarisation
                of our society. They have not delivered on those.</p>
                <p>Sinn Féin has a vision for the future that goes beyond
                present difficulties. That means facing up to rejectionists,
                sceptics and cynics in the British political establishment as
                well as rejectionist Unionism. It means facing up to the reality
                that the paramilitary threat to the process comes from Loyalist,
                Unionist guns.</p>
                <p>We have a significant common responsibility. We were elected
                to provide leadership that would represent the diversity of our
                society. We are leaders with a mandate to lead our community out
                of conflict and into a new and more democratic political
                dispensation. When we signed the Good Friday Agreement, we
                accepted that there were matters on which we could not, at that
                point in our history, reach agreement. We accepted pragmatically
                that we should either take the necessary time to develop
                sufficient mutual trust to move forward or that independent
                bodies should be set up to deal with such matters. That
                proposition is as valid now as it was in May 1998, when it
                received powerful endorsement from the people of Ireland. The
                motion was tabled by a party that failed the test of commitment
                to democratic dialogue during the negotiations. It would be
                unfair to accuse the DUP of having lost the plot with regard to
                the peace process — it was clearly always out of its depth.</p>
                <p>I see no value in following the DUP agenda. It knows that the
                motion cannot achieve its objectives, because it has no effect
                on policy and no binding authority. Its only purpose is to
                harden hearts that were already too hard. It is a divisive
                motion that reflects only the sad vision of its authors. The DUP
                will, no doubt, refuse to discuss the sectarian attacks on
                Catholic schoolchildren on the streets of Ardoyne. We can see
                members of the DUP standing shoulder to shoulder with the UDA in
                Glenbryn, as they did in Harryville, in order to promote and
                prolong sectarian tensions and violence.</p>
                <p>The SDLP’s amendment, much like its arguments on
                post-Nationalism or its decision to cave into Unionist and
                British demands on policing boards, demonstrates clearly why
                Sinn Féin is now the largest Nationalist party. The amendment
                abandons the collective responsibility spelt out in the Good
                Friday Agreement and refuses to acknowledge that, in May 2000,
                we agreed on the need for consistency in the agreement. We
                agreed a route out of our divisions. Go raibh míle maith agat.</p>
                <b>
                <p>Mr Neeson:</p>
                </b>
                <p>My party also submitted an amendment, but it will support the
                SDLP’s amendment. Once again, the institutions are under
                threat, and we must ask ourselves why. The answer lies in the
                refusal by paramilitaries – Republican and Loyalist – to put
                illegal arms verifiably beyond use. I ask paramilitaries whether
                their armed struggles have been ended or merely suspended.
                Loyalist and Republican paramilitaries must answer that
                question.</p>
                <p>Is the Good Friday Agreement a means to an end or is it a
                settlement that secured the support of the vast majority of
                people in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland?
                Unfortunately, paramilitarism is still with us. There are those
                who want to control territory and achieve their own selfish ends
                with bullets to the arms and legs and severe beatings with
                pickaxes.</p>
                <p>There are those who carry out murders and bomb attacks
                because of their blatant hatred of their fellow citizens. There
                is clear evidence that those who are officially on ceasefire
                have been involved in serious violence, including murder and
                murder attempts. They include the IRA, UDA, UFF, UVF and LVF. It
                now appears to be acceptable for Protestants to murder
                Protestants and for Catholics to murder Catholics. It seems to
                have become acceptable.</p>
                <p>The reaction to last week’s carnage in the United States
                demonstrates the democratic world’s total abhorrence of
                international terrorism. Is it any wonder that the vast majority
                of Members treat with contempt the excuses for the presence of
                three Irish Republicans in Colombia? That cannot be dismissed as
                the dying embers of paramilitarism. Loyalist and Republican
                paramilitarism has been allowed to become institutionalised in
                Northern Ireland. Is it not ironic that the police have now
                become the targets of Republican and Loyalist paramilitaries in
                Northern Ireland?</p>
                <i>
                <p>4.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p>The DUP’s motives in tabling this motion are questionable,
                especially as DUP members have shared platforms with Loyalist
                paramilitaries and have also been present at Loyalist memorials.
                Such scenes have been captured by cameras on many occasions. Are
                they democrats, or do they want to stand shoulder to shoulder
                with those who have been involved in some of the worst
                atrocities in Northern Ireland? Time is running out; it is now
                time for the paramilitaries on all sides to deliver their
                illegal arms and weapons. That was what was agreed in the Good
                Friday Agreement.</p>
                <b>
                <p>Mr Roche:</p>
                </b>
                <p>The events of the past week have highlighted a principle that
                is fundamental to democracy — there must be a clear separation
                between democracy and terrorism. That means that no political
                party associated with terrorism should be permitted into any
                form of government that purports to be democratic. That
                principle must be applied equally to Sinn Féin and to parties
                in the Assembly that represent so-called Loyalist terrorist
                organisations, although my comments will be primarily directed
                at Sinn Féin.</p>
                <p>What is the true political character of Sinn Féin? That
                question can be easily answered using the party’s publications
                and statements. Sinn Féin is committed to the Armalite and the
                ballot box. There are three fundamental features of the Armalite-and-ballot-box
                strategy. The first is that the political activity of Sinn Féin
                in the context of that strategy can never be construed as a
                renunciation of violence. In fact, it is a form of political
                activity that is meant to support and legitimise violence. The
                second point is that this Armalite-and- ballot-box strategy is
                not a localised strategy; it is a strategy that links into a
                global network of international terrorism. It is beyond dispute
                that the IRA has long established links and connections with
                Basque terrorists in Spain, the Palestine Liberation
                Organisation in the Middle East and the FARC terrorists in
                Colombia. The international network of terror to which the IRA
                is connected is supported by a number of rogue states,
                particularly — in the case of the IRA — by Libya, which
                supplied it with a huge arsenal of arms in the 1980s. Those arms
                have been kept secure by the IRA in the Republic of Ireland,
                where the authorities have never been able to find them.</p>
                <p>The political activity of Sinn Féin, the political wing of
                this so-called Republican movement, is again linked into that
                network of international terrorism. For example, Amyee
                Hernandez, the spokesperson for Fidel Castro, said on 17 August
                that Niall Connolly, now in a Colombian jail, was the official
                representative of Sinn Féin in Cuba.</p>
                <p>The question that we must ask in assessing the true character
                of this party, and therefore its suitability for involvement in
                any democratic institution, is what is it that cements its
                connection with international terrorism? The answer is
                anti-capitalism, fanaticism and a hatred of the United States,
                which was manifest in the ‘Republican News’ on 12 September,
                the day after the appalling acts of terrorism in the United
                States. An article in ‘Republican News’ actually asserted
                that the United States was itself responsible for the deaths of
                thousands of innocent people in the Middle East and Colombia. It
                was precisely that hatred that motivated those who drove the
                planes into the two towers and the Pentagon.</p>
                <p>That strategy is absolutely incompatible with democracy. The
                relationship between democracy and terror is a one-way
                relationship. Terrorism corrupts democracy. The whole so-called
                peace process and the institutions are based on the opposite
                assumption that, somehow or other, the democratic process could
                democratise terrorism. That was the assumption, and the best
                possible reading that can be given of the UUP leader’s
                concessions to Nationalism. However, Mr Trimble now knows that
                he was wrong and that there is no integrity despite what he has
                just said, in this movement, which is inextricably wedded to
                violence. The refusal to decommission arms is the litmus test of
                that.</p>
                <p>It was not only Mr Trimble who operated under the false
                apprehension that, somehow or other, democracy could democratise
                terrorism. The whole process was sustained by the soon-to-be
                ex-leader of the SDLP. Anyone who has a heart for democracy in
                Northern Ireland will be delighted that this man is, I hope,
                beginning his exit from the political stage.</p>
                <b>
                <p>Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p>The Member’s time is up.</p>
                <b>
                <p>Ms Morrice:</p>
                </b>
                <p>I support the amendment. There is no question but that we
                must address the unacceptable level of paramilitary activity, be
                it Republican or Loyalist. At the same time, we must encourage
                people to remain committed to exclusively peaceful and
                democratic means. As David Trimble has said, we must encourage
                people to adopt those means.</p>
                <p>In Northern Ireland we have a special understanding of what
                has happened in the United States. We must use that
                understanding as an opportunity to move our own peace process
                forward. Every one of us has a responsibility to do that, and
                that includes using our influence to urge the decommissioning of
                all paramilitary weapons. We should use our influence to combat
                sectarianism and bigotry at all levels of society. For example,
                we should get a police force that is representative of our
                communities. I urge all the relevant parties to respond
                positively to the Secretary of State’s call to nominate to the
                Policing Board. We need a well- resourced, highly motivated
                police service to tackle lawlessness.</p>
                <p>We must also confront the problems of sectarianism and
                sectarian violence. We are still living with them. We have not
                tackled them, and it is our responsibility to do so. Political
                leadership is essential. We must never forget that the politics
                of division at leadership level leads to division at street
                level, so it is important that we, as politicians, act
                responsibly in word and deed. There is nothing to be gained by
                using this Chamber for political point scoring. We need to be
                involved now in collective, inclusive negotiations.</p>
                <p>The South Africans suggested that if the chemistry does not
                work between parties or personalities, we should find
                personalities between whom the chemistry will work,
                personalities who will find understanding, so that there will be
                a new dynamic in the process. Above all, we want to continue to
                encourage people to remain committed to the peace process. That
                is essential. In his opening remarks, Mr Peter Robinson said
                that we were settling for a lower level of terrorism. That is
                not the case. We are moving out of conflict. That is what the
                peace process is about. We have come far, but what we need now
                is political stability. We cannot afford instability. We cannot
                afford a political vacuum. Not so long ago, we were held up as
                an example of how mediation can help to resolve conflict. We
                must continue to show the world that it can be done. We can work
                problems out through meaningful engagement and dialogue. We were
                getting there; we are getting there.</p>
                <p>We have the means, in the Good Friday Agreement, to live
                peacefully together. We must fully implement that agreement. If
                we let it go, we let hope go. We must never do that. That is why
                I look forward to seeing every Member back in the Chamber, if
                not next week, then sometime very soon.</p>

                <p>Mr McCartney:</p>
                </b>
                <p>The hypocrisy of David Trimble is truly mind-boggling. He
                condemns the UVF and the UDA — they do need some condemning
                — but he used them to get the capacity to sign the Belfast
                Agreement. He was photographed flanked by them, among his
                supporters. He also used their votes to be elected to the office
                of First Minister. They were useful then.</p>
                <p>From the beginning, my party has said that there must be no
                truck of any kind and no political intercourse with the
                representatives of terror, whether they be Sinn Féin, the UDA,
                the UVF or others. The purpose of the Belfast Agreement was
                never the creation of a democratic political settlement. It was
                about resolving the conflict between the British state and
                violent Republican terrorism, in order to protect the British
                mainland from a bombing campaign. It was cynical, but that was
                the purpose. That is why all Members of the Assembly must know
                that breaches of the ceasefires by Sinn Féin/IRA, the UDA or
                the UVF, no matter how blatant they are, will never be
                determined as such by the Secretary of State. The ceasefires are
                necessary to keep Sinn Féin/IRA in the process. Without
                ceasefires the process is not worth a penny candle, from the
                British political point of view.</p>
                <p>It is necessary for Sinn Féin/IRA to retain its weaponry,
                because that is the accelerant that ensures that the British
                Government, fearful of attacks on the mainland, adhere to a
                policy of movement to a united Ireland. The British Government
                will never find that any of those terrorist groups is in breach
                of its ceasefire. In fact, they are so cynical that they dismiss
                murders such as that of Charles Bennett by the IRA as matters,
                as one NIO civil servant put it, of internal housekeeping.</p>
                <p>The Assembly must face the fact that these terrorist groups
                have no place in any assembly or institution of democratic
                government. Sinn Féin/IRA never signed up to the
                decommissioning of weaponry. Sinn Féin made it plain in the 24
                hours before the agreement was signed that it would walk if that
                requirement were made. Mr Trimble knew that, but he went on and
                signed a meaningless agreement, an agreement that he knew would
                enable Sinn Féin/IRA to remain within this allegedly democratic
                process.</p>
                <i>
                <p>5.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p>The time has now come for everyone to face up to its failure.</p>
                <p>A lot of sentimental expressions and the voicing of almost
                totally meaningless, lofty sentiments, such as those repeatedly
                expressed by Jane Morrice, will take us nowhere. The harsh
                reality of what happened in New York was a lesson learnt from
                the IRA. The IRA was capable of bringing a world democracy, with
                the fourth largest economy, to a policy of abject appeasement to
                protect itself. Why should Osama bin Laden and others not follow
                its example? Such people have no place in any form of democratic
                institution. That also applies to those murderous people, whose
                political representatives are not here today, from the Loyalist
                section of terrorism, who are persecuting the Catholic community
                — their representatives should not be in any form of
                democratic institution.</p>
                <p>I support the motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p>Mr Hilditch:</p>
                </b>
                <p>I too support the motion, and I thank the proposer for
                bringing the matter to the Floor. It is unacceptable that any
                party associated with active terrorism should continue to hold
                Executive positions. It might be helpful if some Members from
                the Ulster Unionist Party who have still to speak could
                enlighten us and elaborate on the comments of Mr Trimble with
                regard to what exactly the Prime Minister, Mr Blair, has done to
                bring this matter to a conclusion.</p>
                <p>I quote from page 3 of the Policing Plan for Northern Ireland
                1999-2000:</p>

                <p>&quot;While most paramilitary organisations are on ceasefire,
                they retain a capacity for sustained violence&quot; —</p>

                <p>and —</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p>&quot;Racketeering and paramilitary assaults remain a scourge
                in a civilised society, while the increasing fear of the
                influence of drugs, particularly in the youth culture, is a
                growing cause of anxiety.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p>That is evidence that while the Secretary of State chooses to
                ignore blatant breaches of the so-called ceasefire, the Chief
                Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, in his policing
                priorities, quite clearly sees the activities of paramilitary
                groups allegedly on ceasefire as a major threat to public order
                and a source of public concern. Indeed, the plan, under the
                heading of &quot;Protecting the Community from Terrorism and
                Alleged Criminal Activity&quot;, lists one of its main
                objectives as being:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p>&quot;to counter the terrorist threat on behalf of the
                community and bring to justice those responsible for terrorist
                crime.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p>The Chief Constable’s report for 2000-01 states that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p>&quot;Paramilitary activity persists, even by mainstream
                terrorist organisations. These organisations, although they
                continue to adhere to their definition of a cessation of
                military operations, have continued to engage in a whole range
                of criminality. They still retain their weapons and thus the
                capacity to kill, injure and terrorise. The people of Northern
                Ireland have endured enough of this malevolence over the past 30
                years and it serves no cause whatsoever except the evil purposes
                that these individuals and groups seek to pursue for their own
                wicked and selfish reasons.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p>Members will no doubt have picked up on the reference to
                mainstream terrorist organisations and the cessation of military
                operations, which points clearly to IRA/Sinn Féin — Members
                of this House by day and also members of a terrorist
                organisation continuing to engage in a whole range of
                criminality.</p>
                <p>Punishment attacks have continued to increase, and the
                intensity of the attacks continues to shock and leave the
                community feeling violated. The number of so-called
                paramilitary-style punishment attacks has increased by 145 in
                2000-01 when compared to the previous year. These range from
                kneecappings to elbows, wrists and ankles being shot to a bloody
                pulp. People are beaten with hurley sticks and baseball bats
                studded with nails, and with iron bars and bricks. This is the
                kind of justice that Sinn Féin/IRA offers the people of
                Northern Ireland. It speaks of human rights, equality and
                justice and offers kangaroo courts as an alternative.</p>
                <p>The Belfast Agreement has become no more than a political
                cover for terrorist godfathers carrying out their dastardly
                deeds on a daily basis. But is it really good enough to expect
                law-abiding citizens to suffer the indignity of having to endure
                a terrorist in the Executive of the Assembly and his cohorts on
                the Floor of the House as part of the Government here at
                Stormont? They orchestrate a policy of ethnic cleansing in north
                Belfast, similar to the one that we have endured in the border
                counties over the last 30 years. This is the democracy that Sinn
                Féin/IRA has to offer the Protestant people of Northern
                Ireland.</p>
                <p>Sinn Féin/IRA is here under false pretences. It believes
                that it has an entitlement to places in the Government of
                Northern Ireland and at the same time an entitlement to wage war
                upon its citizens and to terrorise, racketeer, carry out
                punishment beatings, control drug lords and pollute our young
                people.</p>
                <p>How can any right-thinking person believe that the presence
                of such a group in the Assembly can be an asset to the
                community? It is to the Assembly’s shame that it has remained
                for so long, but it has been tried and found wanting. It has
                been exposed by the gunrunning incident in Florida, by the
                Colombian escapade and by its connections with Middle East and
                north African terrorists.</p>
                <p>A journalist for the ‘Belfast Telegraph’ wrote</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p>&quot;when the men who had done terrible things to their
                fellow citizens were streaming through the rusty turnstiles
                outside the Maze Prison the Secretary of State, then Peter
                Mandelson, said it was a bitter pill for people to
                swallow&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p>Today the pill has generated bitterness; that is proof of the
                pudding. The Chief Constable has voiced his concerns. The
                increased number of attacks by paramilitary groups on cessation
                speaks for itself as does the determination of IRA/Sinn Féin to
                hold on to its weapons.</p>
                <p>The ethnic cleansing of areas such as Whitewell, West
                Circular, Ainsworth Avenue, Glenbryn, Twaddell Avenue, Oldpark,
                the lower Shankill, the Newtownards Road and the Albertbridge
                Road were all orchestrated by Sinn Féin/IRA in an attempt to
                force further concessions on decommissioning. That shows that
                street agitation is more important to Sinn Féin/IRA than
                anything the Assembly will ever decide.</p>
                <p>The facts speak for themselves. Sinn Féin/IRA is here under
                false pretences and has not been committed to exclusively
                peaceful means.</p>
                <b>
                <p>Dr Farren:</p>
                </b>
                <p>At the Lammas Fair in Ballycastle a few weeks ago a crude but
                massive car bomb was diffused. Had it not been diffused it is
                likely that a tremendous fire would have swept through the
                crowded, narrow streets of the town and that Ballycastle would
                have experienced a tragedy proportionate to the horrific events
                witnessed in New York last week. Ballycastle was spared that
                prospect, but those who planned, constructed and placed that car
                bomb were as contemptuous of human life as those who planned and
                executed the horrific events in the United States.</p>
                <p>The Ballycastle bomb was claimed by a group calling itself
                the Red Hand Defenders. This bomb was another in a long list of
                incidents that have taken place across north and south Antrim,
                east Derry and elsewhere over the past year. In north Antrim the
                targets have mainly been premises associated with the Catholic
                Church, the GAA and the Nationalist community. In south Antrim
                two young men were brutally murdered; one was on his way to
                work, and one was walking the street with his friends. In east
                Antrim my party Colleagues, among many others, have come under
                frequent attack in their homes. North Belfast has witnessed
                violence and tension leading to the obscenity of a picket
                attempting to deny young children access to their school.</p>
                <p>To that list can be added the many so-called punishment
                beatings meted out by people with no mandate and in total
                disregard for any norms of justice. Some of those incidents are
                motivated by nothing more sophisticated than sectarian hatred.
                The planning and execution of many other incidents suggest that
                those involved are politically motivated to undermine the Good
                Friday Agreement.</p>
                <p>While much of the violence that I have mentioned is
                perpetrated by Loyalists, so-called Republicans have also been
                responsible for violence, including murder, and they cannot hide
                from their responsibility for that. If the Assembly’s claims
                to uphold democratic values are to be meaningful — and a
                majority here also claim to uphold the principles of the Good
                Friday Agreement — Members have no option but to condemn all
                such violence and oppose, without equivocation, those
                responsible for it.</p>
                <p>As Members know, we are once more at the brink with crucial
                decisions being made that could affect the future of the
                institutions and the agreement. Underlying the decisions that
                need to be made is the choice between a peaceful and democratic
                way forward and the instability that feeds and makes room for
                paramilitary violence. The obligation on Members is to ensure
                that democracy and the will of the people prevail. That does not
                require, as some suggest, miracles.</p>
                <p>Instead it requires a persistent and determined commitment to
                achieve the objectives of the Good Friday Agreement and to use,
                where necessary, all our influence to convince others to do
                likewise. To do otherwise is to betray the democratically
                expressed will of the Irish people, North and South, who voted
                in favour of the agreement. In the achievement of those
                objectives it cannot be accepted that decommissioning should
                await the implementation of everything else in the agreement.</p>
                <p>It was intended that, through the commitments to exclusively
                democratic and peaceful political means contained in the Good
                Friday Agreement, decommissioning would be achieved within two
                years. Further commitments and developments made since then
                restored hope that decommissioning would be achieved this year.</p>
                <p>Paramilitaries, notably the IRA, pledged to work positively
                and progressively with the Independent International Commission
                on Decommissioning. However, their continued failure to progress
                decommissioning is eroding the mutual confidence that is
                essential to the full implementation of the agreement.</p>
                <p>Now that the world is coming together to defend the
                principles of our democratic way of life, it is beyond time that
                we in Ireland, North and South, made it clear that all traces of
                paramilitary terror must be removed, not just elsewhere, but in
                our own country. This would allow our people to enjoy the peace
                and political stability promised in the agreement. I support the
                amendment.</p>
                <b>
                <p>Mr Foster:</p>
                </b>
                <p>The motion should not have come before the House. It is born
                out of the failure by Loyalist and Republican paramilitary
                groups to fulfil the promises they made to the people of
                Northern Ireland when their representatives signed the Belfast
                Agreement. They have failed miserably.</p>
                <p>The agreement committed those groups holding illegal arms to
                decommission them by May 2000. When the deadline passed, further
                talks were held and the groups were given an extension until
                June 2001. Those were not Unionist deadlines; they were
                commitments entered into by the political representatives of
                terrorism in this country. As a result of that failure, parties
                that are committed to exclusively peaceful and democratic means
                have found themselves at a great political disadvantage.</p>
                <p>The political representatives of the IRA have sought to
                remain in the Executive, and to govern the people of Northern
                Ireland while retaining the means to coerce those people with
                the force of arms and the threat of injury or death. Sinn
                Féin/IRA has continued to use the threat of Republicanism based
                on physical force to squeeze further concessions from the
                Government on issues such as policing. Meanwhile, the other
                democratic parties have had to rely solely on the democratic
                mandate that they achieved at the ballot box. The situation is
                inconsistent with democratic principles and is unsustainable.</p>
                <p>The IRA claims that its guns have been silent — tell that
                to the families of the young people who have been abducted and
                shot by the punishment squads, and the families of those who
                have been murdered. If it is not the Provisional IRA, who else
                is abducting and attacking young people in Republican areas? I
                doubt that the SDLP has acquired a military wing. I have no
                doubt that if it were the work of Loyalists or the security
                forces, the Sinn Féin leadership would be the first to run to
                the media and call for an inquiry into human rights abuses.</p>
                <p>The Sinn Féin leadership has been quick to apportion blame
                to the UDA after the recent spate of pipe bombings in north
                Belfast. However, it has been less vocal in its assessment of
                the perpetrators of the numerous kneecappings that have been
                carried out in west Belfast. The silence of leading Sinn Féin
                figures, including, ironically, the Minister of Health, Social
                Services and Public Safety and the Minister of Education, and
                their failure to unequivocally condemn these attacks on young
                people has been as deafening as it has been telling. Actions
                speak louder than words.</p>
                <p>Let no one doubt my stance on Loyalist violence: whether it
                be by pipe bombs, blast bombs, sectarian shootings or punishment
                shootings, I condemn it wholeheartedly. These attacks, like
                their perpetrators, have no place in a civilised society and
                should cease immediately.</p>
                <p>The Unionist community wants no part of Loyalist violence
                and, time after time, it has demonstrated that by rejecting at
                the ballot box those Loyalist parties linked to terrorist
                groups. Sadly, this has not been the case with regard to Sinn
                Féin/IRA. Anyone has the right to sit in an Assembly, provided
                they have been properly elected, but their inclusion in
                Government is a different matter.</p>
                <p>Governments require a higher standard of probity from their
                Ministers. Ministers must govern in the interests of all the
                people. An Executive therefore should not include Ministers who
                support terror in any way, or who give encouragement to those
                who seek to retain the capacity to inflict terror.</p>

                <p>We have suffered from terrorism for a long time. The United
                States has suffered in the last week. Terror at any level is
                terror — it is destructive. I say again that no party should
                remain in Government while retaining the means to coerce its
                people by force of arms and threat of injury or death. That is
                totally incompatible with democratic principles — it is
                fascism.</p>
                <p>The only people in Northern Ireland who should hold weapons
                are the forces of the state and those properly licensed by the
                state within a legal framework of due process. Only then can the
                safety of the citizen be secured.</p>
                <p>How long can some alleged politicians continue to remain
                politically dishonest, circumventing the whole democratic
                system? There is an enlightening saying ‘Tell me whom you
                associate with, and I will tell you who you are’. Does it ring
                true? Are we being told something? I am convinced that we are. I
                support the amended motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p>Mrs Nelis:</p>
                </b>
                <p>Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. How could any
                decent person take the motion seriously, given the track record
                of the party proposing it? That party talks the most about
                democracy and peace, but it practices them least. That party’s
                very origins are steeped in bigotry, sectarianism and
                anti-Catholic fundamentalism. That party’s members have
                literally got away with murder. That party, over the years, has
                nodded and winked its way to power on the back of Loyalist
                paramilitary activity. That party said no to the Good Friday
                Agreement.</p>
                <p>It is well known in political life in the Six Counties that
                violence channelled through Loyalist paramilitary activity has
                been used by Unionist politicians to bolster their position and
                pressurise their opponents. They have not had to accept the
                practical and moral responsibility for, or the consequences of,
                the actions of their paramilitary comrades.</p>
                <p>Since the inception of this state, when moves were made to
                undermine the Unionist ascendancy, or when there was any hint
                that Protestant and Catholic people might come together as human
                beings, the heavy hand and the big mouths of the party that
                proposed the motion were there to ensure that it did not happen.</p>
                <p>Unionists in or out of Government have used state forces —
                the RUC and the UDR — and Loyalist mobs to terrorise, bully
                and intimidate their way to power. The Nationalist community
                paid the price for this co-operative arrangement.</p>
                <p>The righteous brothers on the opposite benches who proposed
                the motion have no problems with cosying up to their
                paramilitary friends when it suits them. We saw it in Glenbryn
                recently, and we saw it in Harryville. The DUP were cosying up
                to the UDA. The common theme of this cosy relationship is to
                stir up sectarian hatred and violence against Catholics. What do
                we see while they are cosying up to the UDA? The hearts of
                Protestant communities are being ripped apart by drugs.</p>
                <p>We have all seen members of the DUP marching on many
                occasions with the UDA and UVF. This was not only to demonstrate
                unity of purpose, but also to signal to the British Government
                that unofficial armies have always supported their position as
                politicians. Loyalist paramilitaries are the muscle behind
                Unionist rhetoric. Yet the Member who proposed the motion can
                prattle on about exclusively peaceful and democratic means. He
                can produce all the statistics he wants, while his party members
                stand on platforms with the LVF. They elect deputy mayors who
                share platforms with masked gunmen showing off their firing
                skills. The Nationalist community sees these people for what
                they are — the Afrikaners of the Six Counties.</p>
                <p>The blatant hypocrisy of the DUP is matched only by their
                ineptitude as politicians who cannot detach from their
                paramilitary allies because they might blow the whistle on their
                extra-political-curriculum activities. <i>[Interruption].</p>

                Chamber its commitment to exclusively peaceful and democratic
                means. The difficulty is that the DUP is not, and never has
                been, a democratic constitutional party. In 1966, the then
                Ulster Unionist Prime Minister, Terence O’Neill, told the
                House of Commons that the UVF had been involved in the Malvern
                Street murder of a young Catholic — <i>[Interruption].</p>

                constitutional politics by joining the Lagan Valley unit of the
                Ulster Protestant Volunteers. Members who are old enough may
                recall that both groups were involved in the explosions in 1969

                <p>Once again, the Assembly has returned to the recurring
                problem of paramilitary activity. Many of us wonder if we will
                ever come to a day when the word &quot;paramilitary&quot; will
                be put beyond use.</p>
                <p>Last week, we all watched in horror as terrorists flew
                passenger jets into prominent buildings in the United States. We
                in Northern Ireland felt all the old feelings of the past 30
                years flooding upon us: the heartache, the fear, the panic and
                — very clearly and honestly — the anger. Sinn Féin/IRA
                added insult to injury by declaring in the Assembly its
                heartfelt sympathy for acts of terrorism, when it has
                participated in the deaths of many residents of this country by
                committing terrorist attacks.</p>
                <p>Sinn Féin spoke of its sorrow at such losses and condemned
                those who carried out the attacks. That sentiment rang a little
                false for me and for many others, as it is well known that
                Middle Eastern extremists have been allies of the IRA for over
                20 years. Perhaps Sinn Féin/IRA is trying to distance itself
                from the Middle East and its extremists to ensure that it will
                receive the mighty American dollar, or perhaps there has been a
                falling out amongst this den of killers.</p>
                <p>Sinn Féin has tried to tell us that the three men recently
                arrested in Bogota are not in any way connected to it, yet there
                are photographs in newspapers of those men participating in Sinn
                Féin party activities. Of course, rumour has it that they
                actually got lost. They were looking for the Bogside and ended
                up in Bogota.</p>
                <p>Perhaps Sinn Féin is using the Nazi doctrine that if you
                tell a lie often enough, people will think that it is the truth,
                but it will not work this time. In south Lebanon, Irish
                passports belonging to known terrorists were found in a training
                camp for wannabe terrorists. It is somewhat disturbing to hear
                Sinn Féin’s president say that he and his party are totally
                committed to the peace process while his colleagues in the IRA
                are having up-to-date training in warfare in foreign lands.</p>
                <p>Sinn Féin has forged links with Cuba — a country not known
                for its high regard for democracy, and with even less regard for
                basic human rights. Mr Adams intends to visit Cuba shortly. I do
                not see Mr Adams and his Colleagues staying at home to get the
                IRA to put its arsenal of weapons beyond use. That would be time
                better spent. Sinn Féin has been very quiet on that subject
                since the IRA pulled out of the de Chastelain commission.</p>
                <p>Sinn Féin/IRA has been quiet about its organisation. Last
                week they sent me, and I presume many others, the numbers of
                alleged Loyalist attacks. It is uncanny that it always remembers
                Loyalist attacks, but it seems to forget those committed by
                Nationalists. I condemn all attacks, irrespective of who commits
                them.</p>
                <p>In tandem with the silent Sinn Féin is the incompetent
                British Government. To my horror, and to that of many others, Mr
                Blair said on Sunday night past that the world had to learn what
                motivates terrorism. After 30 years of terrorism here, Tony
                Blair is still trying to work it out.</p>
                <p>That brought two questions to my mind. First, did Prime
                Minister Blair not learn anything from the Northern Ireland
                Office or from the members of Special Branch, who put their
                lives on the line for his Government? Secondly, he has put
                convicted terrorists in Government positions. Why not ask them
                what motivates them and their abhorrent friends, the Middle East
                extremists?</p>
                <p>Why is the British Government not like the American
                Government? Why is it not righteously angry with the terrorists?
                Why will it not pay any costs or go to any length in the pursuit
                of justice? Police officers’ families have waited in vain to
                find out who killed their loved ones. At least one widow in my
                constituency went to her grave without knowing who was
                responsible for her husband’s murder. The Government has also
                made it possible that this killer will never be brought to
                justice because terrorists are in Government and negotiating the
                type of peace this country will have.</p>
                <p>This week there have been several gun attacks, and pipe bombs
                were found. Paramilitary activists judge young people, who are
                beaten, shot and evicted from their country by organisations who
                feel that they are the real police forces. Who are these people
                to tell us and our children how to live? What is more shameful
                is that youths who come to the attention of the IRA are told to
                report to Connolly House, the headquarters of Sinn Féin, to
                hear what their punishments will be. Sinn Féin said that it was
                committed to democracy, yet it allows an illegal and tyrannical
                organisation to mete out summary justice to the people of
                Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p>Paramilitary activity and international terrorism are the
                same in this country, and we need to stop them. For 30 years we
                have been at war against Nationalist violence in the name of
                politics. Police, soldiers and civilians have been killed and
                maimed while trying to live their lives in a democratic fashion.
                The people of Omagh, for example, still seek the trial of their
                aggressors in a court of law. Those who take part in violence,
                or condone it in any way, should not be part of a democratic
                process.</p>
                <b>
                <p>Mr O’Connor:</p>
                </b>
                <p>I am amazed at the hypocrisy of the DUP. We heard Mr Hilditch,
                whose constituency is East Antrim, talking about what is going
                on in north Belfast. In the 1970s, over 400 children attended a
                Catholic school in Greenisland. When it closed in 1997, there
                were 27 children. Mr Hilditch talks about ethnic cleansing in
                north Belfast. What is that if it is not ethnic cleansing?</p>
                <p>The DUP has always had an ambivalence about dealing with
                terrorists — the sharing of a platform with Billy Wright has
                been mentioned. The inspection of men with balaclavas on a beach
                in Portrush in 1985 by Coleraine aldermen was talked about also.
                Those things are true, and no one can claim to be able to end
                terrorism having given it so much succour for so long.</p>
                <p>Terrorists are active throughout Northern Ireland. They
                inflict huge suffering on all our people. My home has been
                attacked on several occasions. Less than a week after my
                colleague was elected to Larne Borough Council, his home was
                pipe-bombed. That was his welcome to politics, Northern
                Ireland-style. The problem is that the UDA in Larne operates an
                equal opportunities policy — it recruits young Catholics as
                well.</p>
                <p>We need to decommission all those organisations. I agree that
                terrorism is linked to drug-dealing. We were all horrified by
                the events in America last week, which prompted President Bush
                to say that he would hunt down evil-doers worldwide. We have in
                our country evil-doers associated with the Shankill bomb, McGurk’s
                Bar, Enniskillen, Loughinisland, Greysteel, Omagh — and the
                list goes on. We are not in an ideal world. Terrorism must be
                stopped by political means and a better future given to the
                people in this country who have suffered so much for so long.</p>
                <p>In my first speech to the Assembly, I quoted Martin Luther
                King. He said:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p>&quot;We are not where we want to be, but thank God we are
                not where we used to be.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p>We no longer bury 80 or 100 coffins a year, leaving hundreds
                and thousands of grieving widows and orphans. There are murders
                and punishment beatings, but 10 years ago a punishment beating
                or shooting would not have merited four lines on page 10 of ‘The
                Irish News’.</p>
                <p>We have moved forward. We must make politics work. This
                weekend will tell whether we will. I appeal to those with
                influence, in light of world opinion and the international
                groundswell of public opinion against all forms of terror, to
                give peace a chance. Do what you can to ensure that the people
                of Northern Ireland do not suffer for another 30 years what they
                have suffered for the last 30 years.</p>
                <p>Each of us is duty bound to try to do something about that. I
                appeal to all those with influence to use it to ensure that we
                create the peaceful society that everyone in this country wants.</p>

                </i><b>
                <p>Mr Weir:</p>
                </b>
                <p>The Assembly met last week rightly to express its condolences
                to the victims of the terrorist outrage in America and to
                condemn international terrorism. It met against the backdrop of
                many nations’ leaders committing themselves to the fight
                against international terrorism. Like Jim&nbsp;Shannon, I
                listened with a degree of incredulity to the remarks of our
                Prime Minister, given his record against terrorism. Despite
                that, many of us in the Chamber are committed to the fight
                against international terrorism.</p>
                <p>However, if we are to begin that fight, we should do so in
                our own backyard in Northern Ireland. That is where we must make
                the change. The motion rightly condemns all paramilitary
                activity, Loyalist and Republican. I join with many ordinary,
                decent Nationalists who look with incredulity at the extent to
                which the Government have been prepared to turn a blind eye to
                Loyalist violence. It seems that no matter what they do, the
                Government are still prepared to declare that the ceasefires of
                all mainstream paramilitary organisations are intact. It is
                almost as if the only thing that would constitute a breach of a
                ceasefire is a nuclear strike on part of Northern Ireland. Even
                then, presumably, the Government would say that it was really
                the work of dissidents and not mainstream paramilitaries.</p>
                <p>In the next few days, people should bear in mind the
                Government’s record on defining ceasefires when they give us
                the usual assurances about policing: changes will only occur
                when the security situation allows it.</p>
                <p>It is right that there is no moral difference between the
                bombings last week in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania and
                the bombing of Canary Wharf. There is also no moral difference
                between those murders and a murder in an isolated farmhouse or a
                deserted city centre alleyway. Such murders are often forgotten.
                We must highlight those people who are committed to democracy
                and a peaceful way forward.</p>
                <p>The events in New York last week and those here are not
                linked simply because there is a moral equivalence between them,
                but because terrorism is international. The Republican movement
                has been linked with various organisations across the world such
                as extreme nationalist terrorists in Europe, Islamic
                fundamentalists in the Middle East and drug dealers or Marxists
                in South and Central America. The Cuban regime has declared that
                one of the men arrested in Colombia was Sinn Féin’s
                representative in Cuba.</p>
                <p>The Cuban authorities are probably best able to judge who
                Sinn Féin’s representatives to Cuba are. However, the
                reaction of Sinn Féin has been like some latter-day Manuel from
                ‘Fawlty Towers’ — they know nothing of these people. They
                say that they have never met these people.</p>
                <p>We must bring a degree of credibility to the debate. We must
                say that the demand for decommissioning goes beyond the
                agreement — it is a moral imperative. You cannot be in
                government if you have arms at your beck and call. However, you
                also cannot be in government if you have a private mafia, police
                force or vigilante organisation at your back. The paramilitary
                organisations have all of these things, and they make it
                unacceptable for any of those organisations to be in government.</p>
                <p>Worthy sentiments are expressed in the SDLP amendment.
                However, the days of the Assembly relying purely on worthy
                sentiments are long past. The failure of the SDLP to commit
                itself to excluding these organisations means that, sadly, the
                amendment detracts from the original motion, rather than adding
                to it. Members can tell us as often as they like that we must
                encourage people into the democratic fold, but under a policy of
                carrot and stick there has been concession after concession.
                There has been a constant diet of carrots in this peace process.
                It is time put away the carrot and bring out the stick with
                regard to terrorism. I urge people to take cognisance of what
                has happened in the past few days; to draw a distinct line
                between terrorism and democracy, and to support the motion.</p>

                with the thought that the DUP should change its name to
                &quot;the Party of Déjà Vu&quot;. Nothing changes in that
                party — it is always the same. It has no political realism and
                no reality, just stagnation. It has the same old story and
                history that it has had for the last 50 years — <i>[Interruption].</p>

                <p>The DUP is a party that has consulted, and continues to
                consult, Loyalist paramilitaries. In particular, it consults
                with those Loyalist paramilitaries who are presently engaged in
                attacking Nationalists throughout the Six Counties. The DUP has
                connived with, and continues to connive with, those Loyalist
                paramilitaries who are murdering and attempting to murder
                Nationalists throughout the Six Counties. And yet they, who
                sleep in the same bed as the Loyalist paramilitaries, come here
                with a motion that condemns paramilitary activity. The political
                hypocrisy of the DUP was amply demonstrated last Thursday — <i>[Interruption].</p>

                to speak and trooped back in again to listen to the political
                representative of Loyalist paramilitarism. What message did that
                send out to the Nationalist population? The crude and stark
                message that it sent was that it is OK to — <i>[Interruption].</p>

                <p>Let us, and let the general body of Unionism, make no mistake
                about it — there is a viable connection between those Loyalist
                paramilitaries who are presently trying to murder Catholics and
                the DUP in its drive to destabilise the political institutions.
                That message should go out to the Ulster Unionist Party. The DUP’s
                only interest is in destabilising the political institutions.
                Its sole interest is to further split Unionism and become its
                predominant voice. Were that to happen, it would be a sad day
                for Ireland, particularly for this part of Ireland.</p>
                <p>If the DUP could exclude Sinn Féin from this establishment,
                it would consider it a victory. Let me remind the DUP that Sinn
                Féin has a mandate that is equal to, and perhaps better than,
                its mandate. That political mandate will not be denied. As I
                said — <i>[Interruption]</p>

                <p>With the DUP we experience déjà vu and yet more déjà vu.
                Take the party back 50 years; that is where it belongs and that
                is where its political history lies. It does not lie within the
                context of the present political establishment.</p>
                <p>David Trimble said that if my community has a past, it can
                have a future. Likewise, we could say to David Trimble that if
                his community has a past, it too could have a future. If our
                goal is to build new political structures that take
                responsibility for all the people in this part of the island —
                and the rest of the island — in our terms we are going about
                it the right away.</p>
                <p>I say this to David Trimble: we have all contested elections
                under the same criteria. The results may not have been to the
                liking of some parties, but that is democracy. Although we
                signed the Good Friday Agreement, it is obvious that we are not
                yet ready to place trust in each other. We must ask if we still
                trust ourselves.</p>

                <p>Mr Attwood:</p>
                </b>
                <p>My colleagues and I find it profoundly ironic that Gerry
                Adams could not wait to rush to the microphone yesterday to
                praise John Hume, yet today in the Chamber, Mitchel McLaughlin
                could not wait to damn John Hume’s values and vision, which
                are incorporated in the amendment.</p>
                <p>The irony of the comments made 24 hours ago, and the
                inconsistencies of the argument made in the Chamber today,
                expose the lack of confidence that currently infects the
                Republican leadership and Sinn Féin. Rather than acknowledge
                views firmly held and stated, Mitchel McLaughlin tried to demean
                the contributions of the SDLP by saying that our judgement was
                influenced and upset by election results or internal party
                matters. Anyone who reduces a criticism of other contributions
                to that level reveals a lack of confidence and a lack of
                certainty in addressing the arguments inherent in the motion and
                the amendment.</p>
                <p>It is significant that in all Sinn Féin’s contributions,
                which singularly concerned the DUP, there was no acknowledgement
                of the wider international context, nor was there any
                acknowledgement of the Latin American context. The only point of
                substance made was that there was a collective responsibility to
                bring about the disarmament of illegal groups. That collective
                responsibility appears to include all of us, but to exclude Sinn
                Féin. That is the message that comes across. I see that Mrs
                Nelis is nodding vigorously.</p>

                <p>Mr Attwood, you must direct your comments to the Chair.</p>

                </b>
                <p>I have only one comment to make about Mrs Nelis’s speech. I
                ask her to take a pen to her speech and replace the words
                &quot;Loyalist paramilitary&quot; with &quot;Republican
                paramilitary&quot;, and &quot;Unionist politician&quot; with
                &quot;Republican politician&quot;. She should then give it to Mr
                Robinson to use as his response to this debate. Everything said
                by Mrs Nelis could have been said by Mr Robinson with the change
                of two words only; such is the mirror image at the parties at
                that end of the Chamber.</p>
                <p>Mr Trimble rightly said that the SDLP amendment concentrated
                on what has to be done. We also outlined that in our response to
                the Weston Park document. The SDLP singularly outlined a
                political strategy to get us from Weston Park, through
                suspension, to the full implementation of the agreement. There
                must be a new beginning for policing of the citizens and
                communities of the North. We must ensure that we have a bill of
                rights that is expansive and inclusive — a charter of rights
                on the island and a joint committee of the human rights
                commissions, North and South, to bring about the wider
                enforcement of human rights on the island. We must restructure
                our criminal justice system through the criminal justice review.
                We must address inequality and terror in the national and,
                belatedly, in the international context. There is also a wider
                strategy that we need to address, if not in the coming days then
                in the coming weeks. In the words of Mr Trimble, we must ensure
                that we concentrate on what has to be done, rather than, as some
                have done in this debate, on what has been done in the past.</p>
                <p>I want to go back to some of the comments that I made about
                putting weapons verifiably beyond use. Although this might not
                be a fertile environment for new arguments to get Republicans to
                address the issue of putting weapons beyond use, I want to try
                to do so. I do so somewhat cautiously, because I am trying to
                put those of us who are from a non-Unionist background — from
                a Nationalist and an all-Ireland background, a background that
                wishes to share the life of the rest of the island — into the
                shoes of people from the Unionist tradition. That is something
                that people from Sinn Féin signally failed to do this afternoon
                just as, I have to say, the people from the Unionist tradition
                signally failed to put themselves in the shoes of Republicans.</p>
                <p>I want to see the issue of weapons as Unionists see it. I
                might be wrong, but none the less I want to try. Nationalists
                and, particularly, Republicans must understand that Unionist
                unease about the issue of weapons comes from a number of sources
                — not just from the Unionist leadership. It comes from a much
                wider range of sources. The unease is shared by Unionist people
                who, before and since the ceasefires, have spent long hours
                encouraging those within their own community who doubted the
                thinking and intentions of the Republican leadership to move
                beyond their fears. If we do not address the fears of those who
                have tried to interpret to Unionists what Republicans are trying
                to bring about by the ceasefire, and acknowledge that they are
                beginning to lose confidence, we are not dealing with the issue
                of putting weapons beyond use.</p>
                <p>It is time to acknowledge that Unionist unease is common
                among people who assess issues using standards of both word and
                deed, and for whom the concept of putting weapons verifiably and
                completely beyond use must produce real results. That unease is
                shared by Unionist people, who have been traumatised by threat
                and who are adjusting to radical change. They are looking for
                certainty, as they accept the uncertainties of being a minority
                on the island of Ireland. The IRA should acknowledge all that,
                and all the paramilitary organisations should acknowledge that
                it is time to give real effect to the decommissioning provisions
                of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
                <p>Peter Robinson may be proved right. This may be the last time
                that we will debate the issue in the House. I hope that he is
                wrong. Republican and Loyalist paramilitaries must get
                decommissioning right, and get it right now. Peter Weir’s
                strategy was exclusion and the stick. We dissent from both
                exclusion and the stick. Political conflict is resolved by
                political means and if we go back to exclusion on the one hand
                and a stick on the other, we go back in history.</p>
                <p>The opportunity that is beginning to open up should be
                exploited and we must resolve all outstanding issues relating to
                the Good Friday Agreement. A different mindset is beginning to
                develop on this island and around the world. That mindset is
                saying that we have travelled far with those who use threat and
                terror, but we are not going to travel any further. By hanging
                on firmly to the consequences, implications and requirements of
                the Good Friday Agreement, we can work out a political strategy
                that will resolve the outstanding issues and will not see us
                retreating to the failed policies of exclusion and the stick.</p>
                <b>
                <p>Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p>In my winding-up speech, I will deal with two further issues,
                namely the Florida gunrunning by the Provisional IRA and its
                exploits in Colombia, important aspects of the IRA’s
                international terrorist activity. Before doing so, however, I
                must respond directly to the mover of the amendment, who decries
                Mr Weir’s recommendation of the use of exclusion and the
                stick. Presumably, he is recommending inclusion and the carrot,
                and therefore I must question the SDLP’s ability to sign up to
                the section of the Belfast Agreement that appears ostensibly, to
                offer the stick of excluding any organisation or party that does
                not commit itself to exclusively peaceful and democratic means.</p>
                <p>The SDLP tells us that the agreement should be fully
                implemented. But it does not want that section to be
                implemented, because it does not want to use the stick. There is
                nothing that Sinn Féin/IRA could do that would cause the SDLP
                to use the stick and exclude. Even if the IRA took the nuclear
                option, the SDLP would still piously tell us that we should go
                for inclusive politics and try to encourage people into the
                democratic process.</p>
                <p>There is nothing wrong with the wording of the amendment. It
                is just weaker and less effective than the motion, and the
                purpose of deleting elements from the motion is to weaken it in
                order to avoid saying that organisations that are not committed
                to exclusively peaceful and democratic means should be excluded.
                That is the purpose of the amendment, as demonstrated by the
                attack on Mr Weir’s remarks.</p>
                <p>Now we know where the SDLP stands. Perhaps we are not
                surprised that that has consistently been its position over the
                years. What I cannot understand is why the leader of the Ulster
                Unionist Party is going to support the amendment. By supporting
                the amendment, the UUP will be going for a weaker version,
                letting Sinn Féin off the hook. That can be the only outcome if
                that party’s members follow their leader into the lobbies and
                support the SDLP’s avoidance amendment.</p>
                <p>The leader of the Ulster Unionist Party beat his chest in the
                Assembly and told us how he had called Sinn Féin/IRA to
                account. He even had the audacity to say that because of his
                actions Sinn Fein/IRA would be put out of office. He seems to be
                blind to the fact that it was because of his actions that Sinn
                Féin/IRA is in office in the first place. Then he boasted that,
                having put Sinn Féin/IRA into office, he had taken some action
                to call it to account.</p>
                <p>There was an article in ‘GQ’ magazine about the Florida
                gunrunning. A detailed investigation of the events in Florida
                was carried out. Siobhan Browne said:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p>&quot;I kept quiet and they destroyed me. If I had said what
                I knew, if I had testified at the trial about the things I’m
                going to tell you now, the boys would have got it much worse and
                the Good Friday agreement — the sham that it was — would be
                over.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p>Later in the article, there is clear evidence that the writer
                of the report has come to conclusions about the so-called Good
                Friday Agreement. The report says that it is now starting to
                appear that in his rush to depict himself as the peacemaker in
                Northern Ireland, President Clinton delivered an inherently
                flawed, if not flat-out fraudulent treaty. Again, the article
                says that the Florida attorney, Richard Scrugs, had an ironclad
                case. He had surveillance photos, a confession from Bluestein, a
                copy of the wish list, mail and gun receipts, DNA evidence,
                fingerprints and fibre linking Claxton and Mullen to the
                packages. Thanks to assistance from Scotland Yard, Scrugs also
                had intelligence files on Claxton, Smyth and Mullen’s IRA/Sinn
                Féin activities.</p>
                <p>Is it any wonder that they were convicted and that Judge
                Wilkie Ferguson, passing sentence, criticised the sentencing
                guidelines approved by Congress, saying that they made it
                impossible for him to impose a longer sentence? He went on to
                say that if a person could get a life sentence for possessing
                $400 worth of cocaine, this kind of offence ought to carry the
                death penalty. Yet, the Assembly was not prepared to take any
                action over something that a Florida judge thought was worthy of
                the death penalty.</p>
                <p>In the same article, Unionist Ken Maginnis is inclined to
                give Sinn Féin the benefit of the doubt. He said that with an
                operation as big as that of the IRA, it would probably take time
                to reel in gunrunning operations set up before the Good Friday
                Agreement. The article goes on to say that Mr Maginnis was
                ignoring the fact that Claxton and Mullen arrived in the United
                States on 22 January 1999, a full eight months after the
                agreement was signed. It also makes clear the role of President
                Clinton and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in
                attempting to cover up the activities of the Provisional IRA in
                the United States, lest it do harm to the so-called peace
                process.</p>
                <p>Some of the Sinn Féin Members who spoke in the debate were
                very uneasy, wriggling in panic. Some of them went into an
                incomprehensible rant. Mr John Kelly, almost foaming at the
                mouth, talked about Sinn Féin’s mandate being greater than
                the DUP’s. Where are the Sinn Féin Members of the European
                Parliament? How many Members of Parliament do they have, as
                opposed to the DUP? How many Assembly Members do they have, as
                opposed to the DUP? How many councillors do they have compared
                to the DUP? He should go back to the record books and learn for
                himself that Sinn Féin does not have the mandate that he seems
                to think it has.</p>

                </i>
                <p>Mr McLaughlin gave us a pious homily on the peace process.
                He, incidentally, thinks that people go with false passports on
                their holidays to Colombia. Although he has never been in
                Castlereagh Holding Centre — he is one of the IRA’s draft
                dodgers — he had a similar experience, during his ‘Newsnight’
                interview, when he was clearly embarrassed by the position that
                he was being asked to defend.</p>
                <p>He had the audacity to try to link the Democratic Unionist
                Party with events in north Belfast. I want to commend my
                Colleague, Nigel Dodds, for the sterling efforts that he and
                other constitutional politicians in the area have made to
                overcome the problems in north Belfast and to repair the damage
                done to community relations there. The Sinn Féin position is
                &quot;if we say it, it is true&quot;. Whether the facts are
                absent or whether they contradict it, Sinn Féin is quite
                prepared to peddle a lie in order to cover its embarrassment. It
                kicks up as much dust as it can to conceal its embarrassment.</p>
                <p>The Provisional IRA was clearly involved in international
                terrorism, training, and experimenting in bomb making in
                Colombia. It was involved at the highest level; its chief
                engineer was involved. The sanction of the IRA Army Council was
                needed; an IRA Army Council that has three Sinn Féin Assembly
                Members on it — the leader of the party, Gerry Adams, the
                Minister of Education, Martin McGuinness, and Pat Doherty, the
                former head of southern command of the IRA. All three of them
                were involved in the decision to send people to Colombia to take
                part in international terrorism and to bring death and
                destruction to the cities in Colombia; just as they brought
                death and destruction — and still do — to the streets of
                Northern Ireland.</p>
