    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The Assembly met at 12.00 noon (Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr  McClarty] in the Chair).</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="1"></a>Speaker&rsquo;s Business</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Speaker has asked me to advise the House that he will be  absent from Parliament Buildings today on official Assembly business.</p>
    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="2"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Swine Flu</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I have received notice from the Minister of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety that he wishes to make a statement on the outbreak  of swine flu.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: I wish to provide  Members with a further update on the swine flu virus. The most significant  development has been the announcement of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s first confirmed  case of swine flu. People should not be alarmed by that, because, in the light  of the situation across the world, it was only to be expected that there would  be a case in Northern    Ireland. I am pleased to hear that the individual  concerned, who recently returned from Mexico, is at home and continues to  make a good recovery.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is reassuring that, to date, confirmed cases of swine  flu across the UK  have all been relatively mild, and all those who have been affected have responded  well to antiviral treatment. The strategy to use antiviral drugs to contain the  spread of the virus appears to have been effective in reducing both the spread  of the virus and its symptoms. The Public Health Agency has contacted  passengers who travelled on the same flight as the individual who has been  confirmed as having swine flu. As the flight was more than seven days ago, the  Public Health Agency&rsquo;s advice is that the risk of infection is very low.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also emphasise that there have been no cases of swine flu  in schoolchildren in Northern    Ireland; parents, teachers and pupils can be  reassured by that. The message to schoolchildren and everyone else is to follow  simple, effective measures to reduce the spread of the flu. Hands should be  washed frequently with soap and water, and a tissue should be used to cover the  mouth and nose when sneezing. Anyone who has travelled to Mexico or another affected area in  the past week and who subsequently develops a flu-like illness should stay at  home and seek medical advice from a GP. The GP will then contact the Public  Health Agency, which in turn will quickly ensure that any necessary further  investigation is carried out and treatment administered.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This is a developing situation that we are continuing to  monitor very closely. It is clear that the virus continues to spread across the  world, and there are now confirmed cases in 36 countries. In the UK, there are now 101 confirmed cases, and there  is one in the Republic   of Ireland. As I stated  already, Northern Ireland  has only one confirmed case of swine flu, and two are under investigation. The  World Health Organisation pandemic alert level remains at phase 5. That  indicates the increasing likelihood of a pandemic but does not, I stress,  suggest that one is inevitable.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I realise that the confirmation of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s first case may  have caused some public concern. The clear advice of the Public Health Agency  and that of other health professionals is that, although they are treating the  current global situation seriously, there is good reason to be confident that  we can deal with it. Scientists have examined previous pandemics, and we now  know much more than ever before about treatments and about how to stop the  virus spreading. A good deal of work is under way in studying the virus.  However, it is still too early to determine what impact swine flu will have,  and it is not possible to predict whether the virus will remain mild. We must  continue to be vigilant, and we must prepare for a potential further wave of the  swine flu virus in the autumn, when it may be more widespread.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the light of that, it is essential that we use our stock  of antiviral drugs carefully so that the public will be protected during the  winter months. Northern    Ireland is well prepared for any potential  pandemic and has been planning for such a situation for years. In the past few  days, an agreement to secure the production of a pre-pandemic vaccine has been  signed. That is an opportunity to secure vaccine supplies for the UK in  advance of a pandemic wave. Those arrangements provide the opportunity to have  enough pre-pandemic vaccine by December to protect at least half the population  from swine flu. In addition, as part of our plans to deal with a pandemic, we  have sleeping contracts in place. If the World Health Organization pandemic  alert level moves to phase 6 and a pandemic is declared, we will receive a  vaccine when it becomes available. That means that everyone in Northern Ireland  will have access to two doses of the pandemic vaccine if they need them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It will, however, be several months before a vaccine  becomes available. In the interim, we need to ensure that we have enough  antiviral drugs to treat those who may need them. We have a stock of antiviral  drugs that will cover half the population. Steps are in place to increase that  so that there will be antiviral drugs to treat up to 80% of the population.  Previous global pandemics have not been known to have affected more than one  third of the population.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The arrangements that we have in place and that we are  continuing to make will help us to respond well to any emerging situation.  Officials of my Department, together with staff of the Public Health Agency and  in the health and social care sector, have been working tirelessly to ensure that  there is robust surveillance and appropriate testing of individuals who are at  risk. They have also put measures in place to ensure the immediate availability  of antiviral medications to those who may need them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The public should be reassured that the health and social  care service, GPs and other health professionals are geared up to deal with the  situation. Supplies of antiviral drugs have been sent to hospitals, GP  out-of-hours centres and community pharmacies. Work is also under way to  increase supplies of antibiotics to ensure that we have enough to treat the  potential complications of influenza, particularly pneumonia.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Northern    Ireland swine flu helpline continues to  operate, and up to 1,700 calls have been made to the 0800 0514 142 number since  it was set up at the end of April. Information on swine flu is also available  from the UK  swine flu information line, the number for which is 0800 1 513 513. A major  publicity campaign, including television, radio and newspaper advertising, has  been running over the past few weeks. I believe that that has been effective in  communicating the steps that people can take to protect themselves. The main  way that the public can help to prevent the spread of the virus is to follow  good hygiene practices. That includes washing hands regularly, using a clean  tissue to cover the mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, and remaining at  home if flu-like symptoms develop. Those are simple yet highly effective steps  that every individual can take and that will make a real difference.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Every home in Northern Ireland should now have  received a leaflet providing further public advice and information. Again, I  ask people to read the leaflet and keep it safe. I continue to receive full and  detailed briefings on the situation as it develops, and those include taking  part in regular COBRA meetings, which the Secretary of State for Health in England, Alan Johnson, chairs and which the  Health Ministers from Wales  and Scotland  also attend.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Daily updates on the situation continue to be issued to the  media and to all Assembly Members. I assure the public and the Assembly that  this issue is being taken seriously by the Government not just in Northern Ireland  but across the world. I will, of course, report again to the Assembly if there  are significant changes to the current situation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the meantime, Members can remain assured that we have  the necessary capability to respond to the swine flu virus. The Health Service  is well prepared, and I thank Health Service staff for the commitment, support  and dedication that they have demonstrated in the face of a potential pandemic.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  I thank the Minister for again updating the House on the situation facing us.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Over the past few weeks, people&rsquo;s awareness about what they  can do to curb the spread of swine flu has been raised by a public information  campaign, which involves running adverts and providing leaflets at hospitals,  GPs&rsquo; surgeries and other public places. How much has that cost the Department  to date? Will individual trusts be requested at any stage to pay for adverts,  educational programmes or even vaccines for the areas that they serve?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Substantial costs are involved  that were not contained in the health budget. Therefore, we will be seeking  money to cover those costs in due course. I do not anticipate asking trusts to  pay for Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  share of the vaccine, the cost of which will be considerable. Given the  commercial sensitivity of the issue, I do not want to get into details.  However, I can say that the total cost of vaccines, antiviral drugs, extra  antibiotics and all the other arrangements has placed a considerable burden on  the Health Service. My permanent secretary is in conversation with the  Department of Finance and Personnel (DFP) about the matter. Within UK  funding arrangements, there is a contingency fund for emergency and crisis  situations. That is a matter for discussion between DFP and the Treasury.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Like the previous Member, I thank  the Minister for updating the House today. I give credit where credit is due,  and I congratulate the Minister and his officials, as well as the Public Health  Agency, on taking a measured approach to the issue and on their work to date,  including the daily updates, which have been quite useful. I also take this  opportunity to send my best wishes to the individual who has contracted swine  flu; I wish him a speedy recovery.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In his statement, the Minister said that the Public Health  Agency has contacted the passengers who travelled on the same flight from London to Belfast  as the man who contracted swine flu. Have the passengers who travelled on the  flight from Mexico to London been contacted, because some of them might not have  got that return flight to Belfast?  Have the people who were in the vicinity of the hospital when the man presented  himself at the accident and emergency department been contacted? Is the  Minister in regular contact with the Department of Health and Children in Dublin about the issue?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I am pleased to say that the  patient is responding very well to antiviral drugs. His family and the wider  community are also receiving antiviral drugs. The Health Service is providing  antiviral drugs to 16 people in the community as a precaution.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are no direct flights between Ireland and Mexico; the flights come through  other airports, primarily Gatwick. That individual flew from Mexico to Gatwick, where the  standard procedure is that officials from the Health Protection Agency meet all  aeroplanes and provide information to all passengers. He will have received  that information. Staff from the Public Health Agency meet all planes that  arrive at Northern Ireland  airports and provide information to the passengers. That individual&rsquo;s flight  landed on Friday 8 May. The maximum incubation period is seven days, so the  risk to anyone who was on that flight and has not already developed symptoms is  extremely low.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have contacted the passengers, and we consider that 76  of them, including the crew, are from or are based in Northern Ireland. Of those, 20 have  been placed on antiviral drugs. Other people in England,  Scotland and Wales  will have been contacted by their authorities. I have no doubt that, if they  had been considered to be at risk, they would have been given antiviral drugs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My officials are in constant contact with the authorities  in the Irish Republic, and they keep them updated.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>: I  thank the Minister for providing another update and for his reassurances that  his Department has the necessary capability to respond to and deal with swine  flu. The Minister said that he had signed an agreement to secure a pre-pandemic  vaccine and that the Department will receive that when it becomes available. Is  there a difference between the pre-pandemic vaccine and the vaccine itself? Is  the Department giving clear guidance on travelling to Mexico at this time?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Advice on travel arrangements is  provided by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, which advises that people  should not travel to Mexico  unless it is absolutely essential to do so. It has provided that advice for the  past couple of weeks.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As part of the UK  response, there are sleeping contracts for a vaccine, when it is developed, to  cover every man, woman and child in Northern Ireland. The vaccine will  run to 132 million individual shots or doses, because it is anticipated that  two would be needed for each person. Those sleeping contracts will  automatically go into operation and production once the World Health  Organization declares level 6, which is pandemic level.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have also placed orders for a pre-pandemic vaccine,  which is the same vaccine. If the World Health Organization does not declare  level 6, the sleeping contracts will not come into place. The four countries of  the United Kingdom  will buy what we call a pre-pandemic vaccine, which will provide an immediate  opportunity to begin vaccination.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Deeny</strong>: I  also commend the Minister and his Department for dealing with swine flu in a  professional manner, both medically and politically. We have heard that the  vaccine will be available from December. Will the vaccine be able to be  incorporated into the annual winter flu vaccine, a new one of which is issued  every year? That may not be possible, because work begins on that in February  each year. If that is not the case, I suspect that two vaccines will be needed  to protect our population. One will be the annual vaccine, and the other will  be the vaccine for swine flu. That should not be a problem, considering the  number of vaccinations that children have.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The point about the winter flu  vaccine is important because there is an issue about production capacity, and  our contract requirements to fill the required number of winter flu vaccines  for the current year will be completed in June. Only after that will factories  be able to proceed to production of the vaccine for the pre-pandemic or pandemic  flu &mdash; whichever one wants to call it. Although there may be an opportunity to  combine the two vaccines in future years, in 2009 there will be two separate  vaccinations: one for winter flu, which is already under production; and,  subsequently, the swine flu vaccine, when it becomes available.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>: I  welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement and the hard work that he is putting into the  Department&rsquo;s response to swine flu. Can he tell the House whether the  Department has been in contact with health organisations throughout the world?  The spread of swine flu seems to be slowing down as it moves outside Mexico.  Thankfully, there have been few deaths outside of that country.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The response is very much  international, national and local. The Department is responsible for the local  response. The national response is handled through COBRA and the four health  Departments. The World Health Organization is responsible for co-ordinating the  international response.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One feature of the outbreak is that its spread does not  appear to be slowing down. The US  has overtaken Mexico  in its number of confirmed cases, which is now almost 5,000. The update that I  received on Sunday 17 May 2009 informed me that there have been four deaths in  the US,  although I understand that that number has since risen. I will receive another  update shortly. In Mexico,  there have been slightly fewer than 3,000 cases and 66 deaths. Canada  has slightly fewer than 500 confirmed cases.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One feature of the virus is that its speed of travel  appears to be significant. I say &ldquo;appears&rdquo; because no one can be absolutely  definitive about a new and novel virus. That speed is not simply due to  aeroplane travel; there appears also to be rapid person-to-person infection.  The World Health Organization&rsquo;s estimate, which I heard during the weekend, is  that, within 12 months, approximately one third of the earth&rsquo;s entire  population will be infected with the virus. As the earth&rsquo;s population is around  seven billion people, Members can appreciate that the number of people who are  liable to be infected is staggering. That is why COBRA regards production and  access to pre-pandemic vaccines as highly important.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  I also thank the Minister for today&rsquo;s update. Why did the infected person  present himself at A&amp;E and not to his general practitioner? I was  approached by a constituent who has flu and who had contacted his GP. He was  told not to come into the surgery, and no one was sent to see him. Is it the  case that not all GPs have been brought up to speed on the proper procedure?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: GPs have been brought up to  speed on the proper procedure. Indeed, the BMA commended the Department in that  respect. The proper procedure is that people do not present to A&amp;E  departments or to GPs. The best way to tackle the virus is through  self-containment and isolation at home. A person should ring his or her GP, who  will arrange for antivirals to be delivered, provided that the patient meets  the case definition, which is that he or she has been to an affected area or  has been in contact with such a person and that he or she exhibits the symptoms  of Mexico&rsquo;s  swine flu.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At present, the response to the virus is at containment stage,  which means that, if a person contacts his or her GP, someone will take samples  from that person for testing. As I have said, GPs have received that  information. That is regarded as crucial because GPs are at the front line and  are normally the first point of contact for patients. The procedure is laid  down in the leaflet that has been provided by the Department. Our aim is to  ensure that that procedure is followed during the containment stage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Eventually, I anticipate that the response will reach the  post-containment stage. At that point, there will be no automatic testing. If  someone exhibits symptoms, he or she will be given medication immediately. At  present, however, the aim is to contain the virus.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his commitment and dedication to the issue. His  statement makes it clear that the risk of catching the virus in Mexico  is very high and advises people to not travel there. However, in the real world,  many young couples have recently married and have spent thousands of pounds on  a honeymoon to Mexico.  What pressure has been applied to travel companies and their insurers to give  young couples in that position the opportunity to choose another destination?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I covered that matter in  response to an earlier question. We are in the hands of the Foreign and  Commonwealth Office, which has issued guidance to the effect that people should  not travel to Mexico  unless it is absolutely essential. At this point, we are not being  prescriptive, because there are now more cases in the US than in Mexico. There have been  approximately 8,500 cases worldwide to date, and the figure is rising rapidly.  Therefore, it is sensible for people to follow clear travel guidance.  Containment depends on the sensible co-operation of all individuals.</p>

    <p class="H4StageHeading">Healthcare for Older People</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30  minutes for the debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes in  which to propose and 10 minutes in which to make a winding-up speech. All other  Members who wish to speak will have five minutes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly calls on the Minister of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety to reconfigure and enhance services for older people  to ensure that these services are integrated, person-centred and well-staffed;  that the dignity of the individual is promoted; that information is  communicated effectively to patients and relatives by health professionals;  that inpatients receive a nutritional diet; and that personal care is provided  free of charge to all those with medical need.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that the Minister will be present at some stage  during the debate. I thank the Business Committee for bringing this most  important of motions back to the Floor of the House. I thank the Minister for  now taking his place to hear the debate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the past 50 years, older people in Northern Ireland have witnessed a  world that has changed beyond measure. The current generation of older people  has lived through the turmoil of political and civil instability as well as the  arrival of new technologies and discoveries in medicine and services.  Therefore, as the spotlight shines on the lives of a generation of older people  who have experienced more in their lifetime than previous generations could  imagine, it is important that our devolved institution picks up the challenges  that face our older people, embraces the new opportunities and provides the  leadership that is required to ensure that our older generation and ageing  population are respected, valued and properly cared for in society.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That is why action is required to put in place measures  that are not only fundamental to improving the health and well-being of today&rsquo;s  generation of older people but will set the basic principles for tomorrow&rsquo;s  ageing population.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Estimates that Help the Aged has provided suggest that  almost 240,000 people in Northern    Ireland are aged 65 and over, and that  number is expected to increase by 85% over the next 25 years. There is no doubt  that, with people living longer, there will be an increase in conditions such  as arthritis, diabetes, lung disease, stroke, osteoporosis, mental impairment,  cancer, dementia, and hearing and vision loss. Therefore, access to a greater  number of care services, ranging from primary, secondary and domiciliary care  to community care, nursing homes and residential homes, will be required. That  constitutes a challenge to the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety and his Department to provide that high standard of effective  healthcare, which will continue to be essential to enable individuals to manage  their health and enjoy a good quality of life into their twilight years.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On 13 May 2008, the Minister announced that older people&rsquo;s health  and well-being will be a priority in the next round of service frameworks.  However, despite the many statements, strategies and policies published and  standards set by the Department, and despite the good level of healthcare that  is available in Northern    Ireland, care of older people is not always  delivered to a high standard, and the elderly are not always treated with the  dignity and respect that they rightly deserve.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In October 2008, the British Medical Association Northern  Ireland launched a policy document titled &lsquo;Improving the care of older people  in Northern Ireland&rsquo;  to highlight how the healthcare system should relate to older people now and in  future. That document included a number of recommendations, which are  underpinned by the need for equity of healthcare access and for service users  to be treated with dignity and respect. We would do well to examine some of  those recommendations today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A number of areas of concern prompted the recommendations,  the first of which was the integration and co-ordination of services. I will be  crystal clear: unless and until healthcare services are fully integrated and  co-ordinated right across the Department and among the various agencies and  healthcare providers, the delivery of those services for older people will  continue to fail. The current situation, in which various agencies and  providers all work to their own agenda, must change. They must all be united  and working to the same agenda if the deserved and necessary level of  healthcare services for older people is to be provided.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A second issue of concern was staff recruitment, retention  and motivation. It is a well-known fact that domiciliary care workers are  generally poorly paid and poorly trained. That leads to recruitment and  retention difficulties, and, consequently, a high turnover of staff, resulting  in a lack of continuity, which can be unsettling and distressing for older  people. The recruitment and retention of skilled staff must, therefore, be a  priority for the Department and all agencies that are involved in delivering  care for older people. The Department must ensure that properly trained staff  are in place and that they are properly paid for the job that they do with the  older and ageing population.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Thirdly, care must be person-centred. For far too long,  older people&rsquo;s views have not been sought to enable the Department to provide a  care package that is tailored to meet their needs. Older people must be  empowered to make informed choices about their own healthcare packages. It is  essential that the Department liaises with older people to determine their  views and requirements so that tailored packages that meet their needs are put  in place.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There must be clear lines of communication between  healthcare providers and professionals, the Health Service and users. The  information that is provided to users and their families is totally inadequate,  and that must be addressed urgently. The Department must take appropriate steps  to ensure that all health and social care trusts fulfil their obligations by  providing adequate information to users and their families. The breakdown of  communication between the Department, the Health Service, healthcare providers  and families is a big concern for elderly people and their families, and that  must be addressed by the Department. Furthermore, the BMA has recommended that  standards of nutritional care and diets in care settings must be improved to  prevent poor health outcomes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, it must be emphasised that personal care  should be provided free of charge to older people, who have, over the years,  rendered an invaluable contribution to society. Now that they are in their  twilight years, it is only right that we provide them with free personal care.  I have set the scene for today&rsquo;s debate, and I await with baited breath the  Minister&rsquo;s response and his comments on the delivery of an enhanced service for  our ageing population, as set out in the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Sinn F&eacute;in believes that people have  the right to social, economic, gender and cultural equality. Creating the  conditions for establishing an equal society means recognising that many  diverse groups need enhanced protection from the state. Many of the issues that  must be addressed in promoting social inclusion are related to the provision  of, and access to, quality services. Equal services and equal access must be  given to older people in all areas of life. Discrimination in the health  services that are available to people who are over 65 must be tackled.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The introduction of free personal care for all senior  citizens is essential. In relation to healthcare, age should never be a pretext  for not treating people with dignity. Yet, in a survey that was carried out by  Help the Aged, over 50% of older people said that they expected to be accorded  little dignity in a hospital or a care home. In the same survey, 50% of older  people said that, all too often, health professionals dismissed their symptoms  as being down to old age and, therefore, inevitable. Surely that is wrong; if  that is the perception of older people, it must be changed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Older people in the health system often have complex health  needs. In the process of meeting those needs, an older person&rsquo;s dignity must be  recognised as a clear priority. Professional practitioners should reflect that.  As has been mentioned, the British Medical Association made a number of  recommendations in a publication titled &lsquo;Improving the care of older people&rsquo;.  It states:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The social inclusion of older people in our society  must be at the forefront of policy development, to enable all individuals to  participate fully in society without fear of discrimination or disadvantage. &hellip;  Standards of care in all healthcare settings must not only be rigorously  implemented, but exceeded. &hellip; Healthcare professionals and managers must take  responsibility to ensure that policies, structures and resources are in place  so that elderly patients are nutritionally screened on admission and an  appropriate nutritional care plan implemented. &hellip; Cross-border initiatives that  improve healthcare for older people and reduce economic and social  disadvantage, which can result from the existence of a border, should be  developed and implemented.</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">Living in a border area should not create inequities  for its local population. Healthcare for older people should be easily  accessible and appropriate to an individual&rsquo;s need, regardless of their  location. Improvements in cross-border healthcare offer opportunities to  improve healthcare for older people.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">With respect to mental-health matters:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Bamford Review recommendations must be  implemented in full.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The BMA has a number of concerns:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The lack of services for frail elderly patients &hellip;  That older people should have equal access to specialist treatment and be  treated with respect and dignity &hellip; That older people are discriminated against  in the provision of national health services&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The Minister:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;has an ultimate responsibility to ensure that  adequate resources exist to enable those in care homes to be properly cared  for&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I ask the Minister to confirm:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The delivery of older people&rsquo;s healthcare services  must be fully integrated and seamless across and between agencies &hellip; The  recruitment and retention of adequate numbers of skilled staff must be made a  priority for all agencies involved in delivering care &hellip; Older people&rsquo;s care  must be person-centred, and person-centred care must be a key element of the  Service Framework for Older People&rsquo;s Health and Wellbeing &hellip; Communication  between all healthcare providers should be improved, including the provision of  more effective training in communication skills for staff &hellip; Models of care  should be tailored to an individual&rsquo;s need and free to all those who need it.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That includes personal care. In addition:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Support for carers must be increased as a matter of  urgency, due to the excessive burden placed on informal carers as a consequence  of inadequate funding of community care.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I ask the Minister to consider all those issues, because  society owes a debt of gratitude to its older people, and we must ensure that  they are treated with dignity and respect in all areas of their lives. Go raibh  m&iacute;le maith agat.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Here we are again; after thousands of questions for written and oral answer and  many more debates than any DUP Minister has responded to, we are back  discussing a DUP motion on health. Devolution has been restored for two years &mdash;  two years in which the DUP had opportunities to raise these issues. Yet, here  we are, in the middle of a swine flu outbreak, having this debate, unrelated, I  am sure, to the European election campaign. Is the Health Service in a major  crisis? It probably would be if Peter Robinson&rsquo;s draft Budget a couple of years  ago had got through unchanged. The Health Service is not in crisis. It is being  run and reformed well by an Ulster Unionist Party Minister, yet the DUP  continues to snipe. Indeed, it could be reasonably argued that the DUP protests  too much.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Thankfully, the press and media in Northern Ireland are too discerning  to pick up on the nonsense that the DUP press office pushes every week. Maybe  that is because they know that the Health Minister is doing a good job and that  efficiency savings have been forced upon him by the DUP &mdash; the same DUP that  attempts to mislead people about the savings that the Minister is making.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion calls for free personal care for elderly people.  In 2005, my party launched a policy document that called for the same thing. We  are committed to free personal care for elderly people, because we understand  that the welfare state should mean care from the cradle to the grave. The  Minister&rsquo;s phased abolition of prescription charges highlights the UUP&rsquo;s ability  to make, and deliver on, firm policy commitments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although we are committed to free personal care for elderly  people, the fact remains that Nigel Dodds, like Peter Robinson before him, must  decide whether he wants to pay for it. Consequently, the real question for members  of the DUP, including Mr Buchanan, Mr Easton and Mrs Robinson, is whether they  are actively lobbying the Finance Minister for the resources that are required  to deliver on that commitment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The public knows that the UUP is committed to health and to  following through on policy promises, and that the DUP is the party with the  ball in its court when it comes to money. The DUP must stop its crocodile tears  and false outrage and begin to take seriously its responsibilities on financing  health. Motions such as this achieve nothing. Care for older people in a Health  Service that needs reform must be handled sensitively.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is estimated that, in the next 40 years, the proportion  of the Northern Ireland  population over the age of 65 will almost double. That creates challenges for  the Health Service, and it comes with proportional increases in conditions such  as arthritis, dementia, and hearing problems, to mention but a few.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Northern    Ireland single assessment tool, which the  Minister of Health launched in February 2009, will go a long way to ensuring  that the treatment of older people is more streamlined and efficient as the  number of people needing treatment rises. It will ensure that their treatment  is sensitive to the individual&rsquo;s particular needs and that information will be  collected only once.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Care homes are also crucial to the care of older people.  Many Members will have been inundated, as I have been, by constituents who are  concerned at health trusts&rsquo; recent plans to close care homes. In my  constituency, Slieve Roe House in Kilkeel was under threat from the Southern  Trust, as was Skeagh House in Dromore. Members will be as pleased as I am that  the Health Minister is committed to the quality care that those homes provide  and to keeping homes open unless a suitable equivalent facility is available.  Both Slieve Roe House and Skeagh House were saved, as were many other care  homes across Northern    Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister&rsquo;s actions have shown him to be committed to  care for the elderly and to the quality provision of health services for everyone  in Northern Ireland.  Frankly, the DUP&rsquo;s actions and words paint a very different picture.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Member to draw his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  We know that during this election campaign and the public engagement that goes  with it, the public is glad that the Ulster Unionist Party is safeguarding the  Health Service from the DUP&rsquo;s so-called efficiencies.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  Dignity, respect and equitable value and treatment are the key words that echo  through any article or research piece that pertains to our older people.  However, today&rsquo;s society, and sometimes even our Departments, have trouble  applying those terms when dealing with older people in our community.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion calls for the older person to be at the centre  of any and all decisions that concern their health. I was approached recently  by at least two people who, during hospital stays, shared wards with older  people. They were highly concerned with the treatment &mdash; or rather the lack of  treatment &mdash; that those older people were being given. The younger patients were  so appalled by that treatment that they fed the older people and had to help to  lift them in and out of their beds.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It appears that if older people are unable to feed  themselves, they simply do not eat. Breakfast and dinner trays are left on a  table at the bottom of the beds of those patients who are unable to walk. That  is neither acceptable nor humane. It is becoming clear to me that in many  general hospitals, the pattern seems to be that if someone is old, they are a  burden, but if they are old and infirm, they are forgotten.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is not a crime to be old. It is inconvenient, if not  demoralising, for the older person to ask for help in the first instance. I  stress that it is not the nurses&rsquo; fault &mdash; they are under a lot of pressure. The  fault lies with a bureaucratic system that has forgotten that there are human  beings, in these cases, older human beings, at the end of the red tape. They  are suffering day and daily for the sake of administration. The abundance of  administrative work makes it difficult for nurses to do the real job of  nursing. Today&rsquo;s nurses are professional carers, and it is shameful that health  trusts are using such staff to do paperwork.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Public Accounts Committee commissioned the report  &lsquo;Older People and Domiciliary Care&rsquo;, which was printed just over a year ago.  The Committee said that a survey that the Comptroller and Auditor General  carried out illustrated:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;there is scope for the Department to be more  proactive in seeking the views of older people so that their needs and wishes  can be central to decision making.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I am very interested to know whether that  recommendation was ever taken on board, and, furthermore, whether it was put  into practice.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Older people are not androids who can be shifted from  pillar to post. They should not be made to settle for second best just because  they are older. We all age, some of us better than others. Until last year, the  Assembly was led by an octogenarian. However, I am horrified constantly by some  of the stories that are brought to my constituency office. Our older people are  crying out for equality in health, in society and in employment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister  gave us a glimmer of hope in December 2007, when it finally announced its  intention to create the post of commissioner for older people. However, that  has never come to fruition. We were told that the interim post of an advocate  would not delay the creation of the role of a commissioner proper, but, alas,  it appears to have done just that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The objectives outlined in the motion are optimal for  providing good and basic care for older people. The practice of transferring  trust establishments to private enterprises, which was used in the past and is  used currently, is not a good one. I am particularly mindful of the Waterside Hospital in my constituency, which is a  purpose-built hospital for older people who cannot remain at home and require  round-the-clock care. That unit will also undergo a change of usage, which, I  hasten to add, was decided without consultation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">How can the Department be serious about providing a quality  care package when it is closing the very units that are ideal for providing  such a service? Privatisation of healthcare facilities is not a good idea and  will not, in any way, help us to reach the position that is called for in the  motion. As I have said in every contribution that I have made in the House on  issues pertaining to older people, Wales has got it right; its  strategy is already in its second phase, and it is working.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  has been trying hard to deliver, in spite of a very optimistic Budget. My party  voted against that Budget, because we knew that it did not deliver on the  Programme for Government commitments. Our older people deserve proper treatment  and a dignified life.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Member to draw her remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  They were the people who kept Northern    Ireland on its feet, and it is our turn to  support them. I support the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  My party and I are happy to support the motion. We would be extremely angry if  the issues in the motion &mdash; such as respect and dignity for patients, the provision  of good food and information, and the provision of person-centred and  well-staffed services &mdash; were not being implemented, with our elderly and infirm  patients suffering as a result. I am concerned that the fact that the Assembly  is discussing health provision for the elderly means that there may be  instances of that happening.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A recent report from the Regulation and Quality Improvement  Authority showed that some institutions were falling far short of what is  required; problems related to a range of issues, including care, staffing,  record keeping, and the administering of medicines. That is deplorable and  should not be tolerated under any circumstances. Such findings prove the need  for a full-time commissioner for older people; the sooner that position is  filled, the better.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In its report &lsquo;Improving the care of older people in Northern Ireland&rdquo;,  the BMA acknowledges that the care that is available is not achieving the  outcomes that it should and proposes 11 recommendations, four of which are  detailed in the motion. I draw the attention of Members to the last paragraph  of the report&rsquo;s introduction, which states:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;If local policy makers are serious about improving  healthcare for older people, then action is needed now.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The &ldquo;local policy makers&rdquo; are us, and I sincerely  hope that we, as a local Assembly, will rise to that challenge.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am glad that our Health Minister, who is present,  recently stated his commitment to ensuring that the elderly are treated with  dignity and respect while they are in receipt of any healthcare. That was an  encouraging statement, and it is the bottom line. Everyone must ensure that  that commitment is fulfilled and that the days of horror stories are over and  will never return.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Turning to the final sentence of the motion, I am delighted  that free personal care will become a reality. After the motion is passed, we  expect the Finance Minister to provide the funding for that very important  provision. The Assembly can end the misery of those elderly people who have to  sell their homes to pay for personal care at a time in their lives when they  are unable to cope.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On 27 February 2001,  I and the current Finance Minister, Nigel Dodds, asked the Assembly to  implement in full the report that was prepared by the Royal Commission on Long  Term Care, known as the Sutherland Report, which would have meant the  introduction of free personal care.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That was unanimously agreed by the Assembly. However, in  June 2002, my amendments to the Health and Personal Social Services Bill were  rejected. The then Sinn F&eacute;in Health Minister and the Health Committee had no  funding and the time was not right &mdash; any excuse to say no.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In May 2007, our colleague Carmel Hanna tried  unsuccessfully to introduce free personal care; again, no funding was the  excuse. Now that the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in are in control of the purse strings, we  expect the necessary funding to be provided, especially as the motion was  tabled by a DUP Member.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I remind Members of comments that were made by Nigel Dodds  on 27 February 2001, when he said in a debate on care for the elderly:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;No Member would ever argue that, because cancer  treatment was becoming more and more expensive, we ought not to treat people.&rdquo;  &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official  Report, Bound Volume 9, p317, col 2].</span></span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That comment is as relevant today as it was then, except  that the Assembly did not then have the power to implement the will of its  Members. Today, it has that power, and we now expect the necessary funding to  be given to the Health Minister to carry out the will of the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to put on record the Alliance Party&rsquo;s thanks to Age  Concern, Help the Aged, the age sector reference group, and the many other  groups for their excellent campaigning over many years.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Member to draw his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  We want and expect the Assembly, if the motion is agreed today, to put the  funding in place so that free personal care can be achieved in the very near  future.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  There is a well-known saying that a society is judged by how it treats its  vulnerable members, and I agree with that. One category of vulnerable people is  the older generation, who have contributed so much to our lives and who have  moulded the world and how we live in it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Ivryboadie hes bein effected bae sim aulder boadie laike  members o&rsquo; oor ain femmelies ir neebors an we hae aa hed sim blessin&rsquo; i oor  lives oan account o&rsquo; thon.

    <p class="B3BodyText">We have all been affected by the input of someone older  than ourselves, whether it be a family member or a neighbour, and we have all  had some blessing as a result of that input. I say that not simply because I am  now a proud grandfather myself, and, some might say, starting to move into the  older bracket. I say that because I have respect for those who have lived their  lives working and taking care of others, and who now need the little bit of  care and respect that is due to them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">According to a British Medical Association survey last year  on the care that was provided to older patients, eight in 10 doctors believed  that healthcare services for older people were not good enough. Those are not  my words, but the words of the survey. Only one in 10 doctors believed that the  NHS spent enough money on care for the elderly. About 500 GPs, consultants and  staff-grade doctors responded to the survey.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The biggest concern was the lack of services that were  available in the community, with only 8&middot;1% feeling that activities that were  provided in residential and care homes to maintain mental agility and physical  exercise were adequate; some 62% thought that there were not enough services to  support people with dementia; and just over 33% said that older people have  continuous access to podiatry services.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That is why it is time to focus services more specifically  on older people so that centres are well equipped and staffed. The motto of the  Health Service should be to promote the importance of care services for older  people; if that were the central theme, delivery would soon follow.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have, for some time, advocated a direct-payment scheme  that allows older people to choose how to allocate their budget and meet their  care needs. What has been surprising is that there has been only a small  take-up of the scheme. What steps can the Minister take to ensure that the  scheme is more widely known about? The scheme would definitely help people to  get what they need rather than accepting something less that does not always  completely meet their needs. There must be a way of ensuring better knowledge  and take-up of the scheme, and that is something that the Minister and his  Department could address.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is of the utmost importance that the dignity of the  individual is promoted. I get frustrated and angry when I see how elderly  people are often brushed aside and ignored because of their age. I am sure that  I am not the only person to have heard people making derogatory comments about  people being old and having nothing else to complain about. None of us has  control over life and death, and it behoves all of us who express such  statements to be aware of the fragility of life and to be aware of the fact  that, some day, sooner than we care to think about, we will be in a similar  position, and we would not like to be treated in the way that they are treated.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">1.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">People who come into my advice centre regularly tell me  that information does not flow freely between patients and relatives and health  professionals, and the manner in which some news is given can, at times, breed  fear. That information may not always be the most palatable, and it may  represent bad news, but it must be relayed. Although the information is always  relayed professionally, sometimes a stark and cold approach adds to the angst that  is felt. There is often a better way of doing things, and it is important that  we address that issue. Older people in particular may find it harder to  understand what is said to them in a clinical manner. They would benefit from  someone spending time with them and explaining in detail and in everyday terms  their prognosis and treatment plan.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Too often, as elected representatives, we have heard  constituents saying that no one told them what was happening. That must stop.  There must be a holistic approach to care. It is vital for older people to have  a balanced, nutritional diet. As someone who was recently diagnosed as  diabetic, I know the importance of a healthy diet. Older people have the right  to receive the best care and nutrition.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We spend much time saying that there should be equality for  men and women, black and white, Protestant and Catholic, but what about old and  young? I support the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I, too, welcome the opportunity to  speak in the debate, and I commend the Members who brought this important issue  to the Floor of the House. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s attendance. Last week, I  criticised him for being elsewhere during the swine flu outbreak, but he is  here now, and I commend him for that. It is important that the Minister, as the  boss of the Health Department, hears at first hand the issues that we raise.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members who have already spoken highlighted strategies and  recommendations, so I do not propose to go over that again. I am going to ignore  the opportunity to get involved in an election fight between the DUP and the  Ulster Unionist Party because we need to bring some reality into the debate.  Jim Shannon rightly pointed out that, every other week, we talk about how we as  a society will be judged on how we treat our most vulnerable citizens, whether  they are children, young people, the elderly or people with disabilities. We,  as a society, will be tested on that, and we need to show that we want to make  changes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">With that in mind, I thank the Assembly&rsquo;s Research Services  for the information that it provided to us for the debate. Mary Bradley  mentioned last year&rsquo;s Public Accounts Committee&rsquo;s report into older people and  domiciliary care. A number of important points struck me when looking through  the research papers. In 2005-06, trusts spent more than 60% of their money on  residential or nursing home care, but the overall number of people who received  those services fell. That is an important issue. Will the Minister provide us  with more up-to-date information on that? The motion calls on the Minister to  reconfigure and enhance services for older people. The Public Accounts  Committee has raised those issues with trusts, through the Comptroller and Auditor  General, and we must reconfigure those services.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Public Accounts Committee also stressed the importance  of more careful planning of discharges from institutions, including hospitals,  and the need to ensure that an appropriate package is in place. We can all  relate to that. Every day, but particularly during the winter months, there are  delayed discharges from hospitals, because the proper care package is not in  place for patients, most notably for elderly patients. There must be seamless  links among hospitals, trusts and society.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that we are not inundated with cases of swine flu  this winter, because that would add to the problems that we already face. That  brings me back to the motion. We are talking about the dignity of the  individual. If that is to be promoted, we must deal with delayed discharges by  ensuring the delivery of proper, person-centred care packages.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Research and Library Services information pack also  informs Members that the Department has been involved in trying to get the  right services delivered to older people since the 1990s. I have no doubt that,  19 years down the line, the Department knows what services are needed. It is  2009, and we must deal with that need.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members have spoken about carers. We are in debt to carers:  we owe them a lot of gratitude because they take a lot of pressure off the  Health Service. They must be commended for the work that they do for society in  general and for their loved ones in particular.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am conscious of the time. Some Members have mentioned the  British Medical Association (BMA). I am struck, not by recommendations of the  BMA, which were useful, but by the introduction to them from the then chairman  of the BMA council, who, in 2008, said:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Despite the high standards of healthcare that  exist&hellip;the British Medical Association&hellip;is concerned that the care of older  people is sometimes deficient, despite the many strategies, policies and care  standards that exist. This is unacceptable.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Therefore, like other Members, I make no apology  for supporting the motion or for bringing some of the issues involved to the  House or to the Health Committee, because that is what I am elected to do.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  I cannot. I have 20 seconds left in which to speak.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Going back to Jim Shannon&rsquo;s point, which I want to  highlight, discrimination is an issue.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member must draw her remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Ramsey</strong>:  In order to ensure that no one is discriminated against, the Assembly must  protect our most vulnerable people.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  It is another Monday, and once more we have a DUP motion on health, the  fifty-sixth, to debate. I will add little to what I said this time last week  except to say that, if the then DUP Finance Minister, Peter Robinson &mdash; the  husband of one of the Members who tabled the motion, who is, unfortunately, not  able to be here today, Mrs Iris Robinson &mdash; had given the Health Minister the  budget that he requested, there is no doubt that we could have afforded to keep  parity with the rest of the United Kingdom. Such parity is proclaimed by the DUP  everywhere other than in health; never mind the wish list with which the DUP  regale Members every week.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion is a further DUP attempt to portray the Health  Minister as someone who cuts services and fails to deliver. That flies in the  face of the evidence. The motion mentions effective communication of  information to patients. The Minister assessed the cost to his Department of  free personal care and made a bid for that funding during the budgetary process  for the current CSR period. That bid was rejected by the then Finance Minister,  Peter Robinson.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister is currently implementing reforms to improve  care for older people while increasing the level of care provided in the  community. In January 2009, Mr McGimpsey launched the Northern Ireland single assessment  tool, which is a mechanism designed to assess the care needed for older people  from the Health Service. The population is ageing; the over-75 age group will  almost triple in the next 50 years. The Department is spending more than &pound;600 million  on our older people, the second-largest slice of the health budget after acute  services. The Northern    Ireland single assessment tool allows for a  person-centred evaluation of people&rsquo;s needs to ensure that they get the right  individual care packages, whether in their own home, residential homes or  nursing homes. That is already happening. Other areas of the United Kingdom have introduced  single assessment processes. However, they have not developed an assessment  tool to underpin those processes. Northern   Ireland is unique in that it has developed a single  assessment tool that is specifically designed for the health and social care  system in Northern Ireland.  Its use across the region will bring consistency to the assessment of older  people. Despite the draconian requirements that the DUP Ministers imposed on  Minister McGimpsey, he has managed to produce improvements here that are in  advance of the rest of the United    Kingdom. On that issue and on many others,  we have an active and proactive Health Minister.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Once again, today&rsquo;s motion is an attempt by the DUP to blow  hot air. The Minister has already proven his deep commitment to older people,  as has my party. I thank Members from other parties who paid tribute to Michael  McGimpsey for being an efficient and caring Health Minister. He acts swiftly  when the need arises. The Finance Minister should look at the Budget again and  give the Health Department the money that it requires.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>:  It is always good to remind ourselves of the needs of older people. We are all  very aware of the growing elderly population; we have seen the figures. We are  all living longer because we have a better standard of living and much better  healthcare. Of course, that has huge impacts and financial implications and  presents many challenges for the Health Service today and in the future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Caring for the elderly, whether it is residential, nursing  or domiciliary care, is very demanding and rewarding work. Many family members,  through love or gratitude, deliver a lot of that care. We have to be aware that  if the carers were not there, much of the work that they do would have to be  done by health services.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As far back as 1990, the Health Department published a  paper entitled &lsquo;People First&rsquo;. Its key objective was to ensure that older  people were able to live in their homes as independently as possible, although  it recognised that some older people will always require supported housing or  residential or nursing care. We are aware of the Public Accounts Committee&rsquo;s  2008 report, which stated that significant numbers of older people were still  being treated in institutional settings. We are all aware of older people in acute  hospital beds who are waiting for placements in residential or nursing homes,  or, indeed, temporary care in step-down beds.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Big, domiciliary care packages do not always have to be  used to provide for the needs of the elderly and the very frail. Sometimes, a  little support can really pay dividends in increasing a person&rsquo;s independence.  Nowhere is prevention and early intervention more important. Since before I was  elected to the Assembly, the SDLP has called for free personal care. Indeed, before  I came here, I assessed older people for domiciliary care, so I am very aware  of the inequalities in the systems.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is impossible to separate the nursing and personal care  elements. However, as has been said, we have agreed to free personal care for  the elderly in the past. The issue has been debated several times. Perhaps the  Minister will take the opportunity to update us on a timescale and a funding  stream to provide it, because that is very important.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The BMA produced a policy document on improving care for older  people that mentioned several of the issues highlighted in today&rsquo;s motion. It  goes without saying that all patients should have a care-centred package but  none more so than older, vulnerable people.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">1.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Special attention is required to ensure that frail, elderly  people are able and willing to eat the food that is provided, whether it be  meals on wheels or hospital meals, and to ensure that somebody is there to help  them, if necessary, so that those meals are not left sitting on a bedside  table.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As far as duplication and better communication are  concerned, we all know that duplication is a waste of money and that it is very frustrating for patients to  be asked the same questions over and over again.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP firmly believes in prevention and early intervention.  If people have good general health and if they are encouraged to stop smoking,  to limit their alcohol intake and to get more exercise, that pays dividends  when they grow older. Of course, as we get older, we become more prone to  cancer, heart disease, thinning of the bones and other such ailments. The new  Public Health Agency will pick up on all those issues, particularly those  around prevention and early intervention. People will live even longer because  their health will be better. If the health of older people gets better  generally, fewer NHS resources will be required to care for them, and the  resources saved can then be directed to where there is more need.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I  want to extend a f&aacute;ilte, a welcome, to the Minister. There is some discussion  about whether we should have this debate, but I support us having it. It raises  the profile of health provision for older people. I am reminded of a comment  made by Elaine Way,  the chief executive of the Western Health and Social Care Trust. She said of  the recent consultation on care provision in residential homes that, whatever  the outcome in any particular area, the consultation at least raised the  profile of the issue, and other health professionals working in the Western  Trust agreed. That is important in itself.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I spoke to somebody in the Western Trust about today&rsquo;s  motion. That person told me that the trust is moving towards providing an  integrated service. When I looked at the website for the Western Trust, I saw  that the word &ldquo;integration&rdquo; is used repeatedly. That is important, even in a  subliminal way. There is nothing worse than older people having to go here or  there to find an occupational therapist, a community nurse or any of the  various health professionals who might be needed to deliver care to them in the  community, as my party colleague said. An elderly person should not be in the  position of not knowing exactly what their community care package will be. That  point was made in the latest PAC report, which noted that community care  packages are key.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">An integrated service delivery team is in place in the  Western Trust, which operates in my area of West Tyrone. It is early days, but  that is very important. There are four service localities in the Western Trust  area, stretching down as far as Fermanagh and up towards Derry,  and within each there is a senior manager and three subgroups. When I talked to  the health professional from the Western Trust, it was stressed to me that it  is early days but that the trust is very conscious of the need for an  integrated service. A number of Members made that point.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also discussed the promotion of the dignity of individuals  with the health professional from the Western Trust. That is a key issue, and  it was mentioned by other Members including my party colleague Mickey Brady. It  is particularly important that the dignity of an individual is promoted. Often,  people who require a home help feel that they are in some way begging for help.  Many of them are proud individuals who do not want to be put in such a  situation. Therefore it is imperative that the dignity of the people in the  community who require a home-help service is protected and promoted.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When speaking to the health professional from the Western  Trust, I got the impression that the trust is aware of the need to protect and  promote the dignity of individuals. It is employing flexicare. The system is in  its infancy in the Western Trust, and I heard criticisms of it at an event that  I attended on residential care homes. However, it is early days for the system,  and it is hoped that it will be more effective when the teething problems have  been sorted out.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As regards communication, the Western Trust has learned  from the consultation.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member draw her remarks to a close?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  There are mechanisms in place to improve communication.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Western Trust did a good job on the residential care  home. Representatives from the trust went to Greenfield Residential Home for  Older People and spoke to people there, and I know that the same happened in  other cases.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The debate is helpful in raising the profile of the issues  included in the motion. Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Deeny</strong>: I  support the motion. I am pleased to be speaking on behalf of the elderly, a  section of our population whom I consider to be wonderful. I agree with Mrs  McGill and disagree with Mr McCallister: the debate is worthwhile, if only to  give much-needed public reassurance to the elderly from the House and the  Minister that their health and social care needs will be met in the future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As has been said, the elderly are an important section of  our community. They have paid their way in society, and they deserve to be  treated well in the future. They should not be marginalised or feel that they  are going to be marginalised. As has been said, they should be treated with  care and respect.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Shannon talked about GPs and their concerns, and he is  correct: GPs are concerned. We talk about care in the community, and that is  the right way to go. However, if all sorts of patients, including the elderly,  are to be treated in the community in the future, the finance to put the  necessary resources in place is required. That is an important point to be made  today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Our elderly people are an important section of our  patients, and, increasingly, they will be looked after in the community.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  Does the Member agree that by virtue of the fact that the motion on the Order  Paper has been moved by the DUP &mdash; the governing body in the Assembly &mdash; it must  have received a wink or a nod from the Finance Minister that he would provide  sufficient funding to implement the motion?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Deeny</strong>: I  agree with Mr McCarthy. However, this debate is not the place for inter-party  bickering. We are talking about the elderly, who are an important section of  our community.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I feel privileged to have worked with and for our elderly  for well over 25 years as a front line health professional. They still have a  major part to play in society and have a lot to offer. If one listens to the  elderly, one can learn from their wisdom.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that health professionals are given the  resources they need to ensure that they are able to work in the community to  keep elderly people mentally and physically healthy, fit and active. Elderly  people contributed greatly to the world as we know it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As a healthcare professional, I find older people the most  satisfying group to work with, because they express the most gratitude. Many of  my patients are quite old, and they remember the days before the NHS was  established to provide free care in 1948. They are very grateful for treatment  and express their thanks, and those of us who treat them like and appreciate  that gratitude.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We must also remember that almost 250,000 people are over  65 years of age. Let us not forget that we are all heading in the same  direction; we will all be elderly some day. Therefore, it is vital that we send  out a message today that the health and social care needs of our elderly  population will be met. The House, the Department of Health and other  Departments have a responsibility to send out that loud and clear message  today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I mentioned GPs&rsquo; concerns. I know a lot of elderly folk,  and I am keen to stress that I consider some them to be my close friends. There  is concern among those elderly people &mdash; particularly when they hear of  efficiency savings &mdash; that they will be left at the back of the queue and that  their needs will be seen to be less important than the needs of others. Those  are the people we need to reassure today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am also worried about community care. I have said time  and again in the Health Committee and elsewhere that we need to ensure that  resources are available in the community to provide the care that is being  planned for the future. We need adequate numbers of doctors, nurses and carers.  Other Members have mentioned carers, and it is important to incentivise people  to become carers. I know people who cannot get work at present and are claiming  unemployment benefit. They need financial incentives to reassure them that care  work will be well paid. They also need geographical incentives because, for  instance, some people who would like to be carers are not interested in doing  so because they are being asked to work far from home. Elderly people want to  remain and be looked after in their own homes. That is consistent across the  board.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Today, the Health Department must send out, loud and clear,  the reassuring message to elderly people that their health and social care  needs will be provided for. The whole House should state that in no way will  elderly people be sidelined or marginalised but that all of their health and  social care needs will be fully supported. I ask all Members to support the  motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: Our older  population is increasing. Over the next 50 years, the number of people aged  over 65 will more than double, from almost 250,000 to 500,000. The number of  people aged over 75 in our community is rising faster than the number in any  other age group; by 2050, it will be three times greater than it is today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We already spend more than &pound;630 million a year to support  older people &mdash; a spend that is second only to funding for acute services &mdash; and  I am investing a further &pound;60 million in this CSR period to support an  additional 1,500 older people in the community. I remind Members that that is  considerably more than the budget increase that I received, which was just over  1% per annum in real terms. We are investing where we see the need.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to tell the House about the significantly greater  investment for older people, investment which older people deserve and which I  am committed to increasing to ensure that people are properly supported to live  independently and safely in the community and in their own homes. Members will  be aware, however, of the struggle that I had to increase the initial Budget  allocation to my Department despite rigid opposition from some in the DUP.  Although I succeeded in increasing my final allocation, it still falls short of  the level needed to give the people of Northern Ireland the service that  they deserve. Despite denials, demand for health and social care services  continues to increase right across health, social services and ambulance  services. The public expect rapid access to high-quality healthcare in  hospitals and in the community.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">1.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Every day, I am forced to make difficult decisions because  of the lack of funding. I have to deliver services to people in Northern Ireland.  I have made that point many times, but, sadly, some people have taken a long  time to accept it. However, during a debate three weeks ago, it appeared that  the penny had finally dropped for some Members. As I said then, the DUP  controls finances because the Minister of Finance and Personnel is a member of  the DUP. If some of those Members are so concerned, have any of them even  approached their Minister of Finance and Personnel to ask about the provision  of increased funding for the Health Service, and, if not, why not? If they  have, what was his answer?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Rather than acknowledging the problems that our Health  Service faces, some people have criticised me for not having enough money when  I have not been given enough money in the first place. That is hypocrisy.  Members choose to turn serious health issues into point-scoring exercises for  electioneering purposes. Cynical tactics smack of political opportunism and are  totally against the principles of the Health Service, which seeks to serve the  entire population equally. If Members are so outraged that I do not have the  resources to fund the Health Service properly, are they prepared to stand with  me and the many healthcare workers in fighting for more money?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My difficulties have been compounded by the requirement to  achieve 3% efficiency savings amounting to &pound;700 million by 2011. The Health  Service can be more efficient and should always strive to spend every penny  carefully. However, we are being asked to do so in a short time frame, while we  are already struggling to catch up with a massive &pound;300 million funding gap  compared with England,  which will rise to &pound;600 million by 2011. I note the comparisons made with the  mainland, which many people seem, conveniently, to ignore. The most vulnerable  groups in society, including elderly people, are paying for years of  underfunding.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We debated a motion on the issue only a month ago, and it  is astonishing that despite standing on the steps of the Building with trade  unionists to demand that health should be exempt from the CSR process, some  Members did a dramatic U-turn and walked through the Lobby against such a  proposal. That approach has been met with disdain by many who work in the  Health Service. It is time for Members to realise that actions speak louder  than words.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I now turn to the motion&rsquo;s call to provide free personal  care to those with medical needs. Members will be aware of my support for the  principle of free personal care. In May 2007, that issue was the topic of a  motion in one of my first debates as Minister. After that debate, I asked  officials to carry out an assessment of the costs and implications of  introducing free personal care and to consider a range of alternative options:  excluding a person&rsquo;s main home from any financial assessment; increasing the  level of assets and savings a person can hold; increasing personal expenses  allowances; and an update of the proposal originally put to the Executive in  2002. The report concluded that it would cost over &pound;30 million a year to  introduce free personal care and significantly more to introduce alternative  options.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At the last Budget, I made a bid for the necessary  resources to allow me to introduce free personal care, and despite a compelling  case, my request was refused. Surely that demonstrates that if the proposers of  the motion are serious, they would take up the issue with their Minister of  Finance and Personnel, because it was that DUP Minister who turned down the  request. Nonetheless, everyone is well aware of the severe constraints on my  budget, which mean that I am unable to proceed with the introduction of free  personal care at this point. That will come as a great disappointment to many  people, but it reflects only the extreme difficulty that we face in providing  services within limited resources. Personal care, not only for older people but  for everyone who needs it, is already free in a person&rsquo;s own home, and Northern  Ireland is the only part of the UK where that is the case.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I remain committed, however, to the principle of free  personal care in care homes and will keep the matter under continual review.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Despite the constrained budget that is available to me, I  am determined that our services be designed and structured to meet the needs of  our older people in the most effective and efficient way possible. Ensuring  that our older people are treated with dignity across the health and social  care sector is more than just a tick-box exercise &mdash; it is fundamental to what  we do. Dignity means care that supports and promotes and that does not  undermine a person&rsquo;s self-respect.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In November last year, I launched &lsquo;Improving the patient  and client experience&rsquo;, which identified privacy and dignity as one of the five  standards that are central to ensuring a positive patient experience of health  and social care. As a starting point, a proper, consistent and comprehensive  assessment of need is fundamental to ensuring that we have a full picture of an  individual&rsquo;s needs and that we can determine how best to meet those needs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Assessment must focus on maximising opportunities for  patients and clients to maintain an independent life where possible, and it  must take account of their expectations as well as physical needs. It is  absolutely vital that assessment be designed to give older people the  opportunity to participate fully in their own assessment, and that is why I am  investing more than &pound;1 million in the development and implementation of a  single assessment tool for older people. Northern   Ireland will be the first region in the UK to use a single tool that is  specifically designed to strengthen our integrated assessment process. As a  result, whether in Bangor  or Belleek, our older people will receive the same comprehensive assessment. As  the single assessment tool is embedded in practice, I expect to hear about  better assessment experiences and for people to have better outcomes that are  based on independence and choice.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Above all, I want to end inappropriate institutional care  for people who can, and want to, be supported to live at home. Indeed, that is  already happening. In recent years, significant changes have been made to the  wide range of support that is available to older people. There has been a shift  away from inappropriate hospital-based care to support services that are  provided in the community. We have almost eradicated bed blocking by medically  fit people, who can, and should, be supported elsewhere.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The range of support service is diverse and includes  assistive technology; promoting active ageing; protecting vulnerable people;  responding to acute crises when they arise; providing the opportunity for  rehabilitation; and supporting carers. The expansion of responsive domiciliary  care services has been a central element of our response. Working closely with  the independent and voluntary sectors, we have made significant strides in that  regard over the past number of years. We now support more people with complex  needs in their own homes than are in either residential care or nursing-home  care. I have set challenging targets for the service to ensure that we continue  to build on the good work that is already being done. The continued development  of immediate-care services such as rapid-response nursing and step-up/step-down  beds is making a real and positive difference to people.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">By providing focused intensive care in the right setting,  we can avoid unnecessary admission to hospital and reduce delayed discharge.  Supported living also has an important role to play. I opened Barn Halt  Cottages in Carrickfergus in October 2007, and I want to see that type of  development appear across Northern    Ireland. I am aware that some trusts are  drafting supported-living proposals, and I look forward to working with  Minister Ritchie as those proposals develop. All the developments that I have  mentioned show how services for our older people are changing for the better.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In order to meet our patients&rsquo; needs, it is also important  that we have the right number of staff, with the right skills, in the right  place, and at the right time. However, I want to make it clear that the changes  will not happen overnight. The process must be evolutionary and take account of  the wide range of services that people want and need. We must recognise that  residential and nursing homes have an important role to play when ill and  vulnerable older people can no longer be safely supported in their own homes.  Similarly, although we aim to reduce inappropriate hospital admissions, I  recognise that there will be times when older people must be admitted to  hospital for treatment. Indeed, older people occupy about two thirds of general  hospital beds.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Everyone who is admitted to hospital should have access to  a nutritional diet, but I recognise the particular importance of a nutritional  diet for older people. Patients over the age of 80 who have been admitted to  hospital are five times more likely to suffer from malnutrition than those  under the age of 50, and older patients may be at greater risk of not being  able to recover.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In November 2007, nursing care standards for patient food  in hospital set out the level of nutritional quality that is to be achieved.  Patients are screened for malnutrition on admission to hospital, nursing care  plans are put in place for those who require nutritional intervention, and all  patients who need help with eating and drinking are identified clearly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Turning to the communication of information to patients and  relatives, the Health and Social Care (Reform) Act (Northern Ireland) 2009  places a statutory duty on Health Service organisations to involve people  actively in decision-making at a regional, local and individual level. That  involvement must be co-ordinated and meaningful to give people a sense of  ownership of the decisions that affect their lives. In addition, the Patient  and Client Council has a statutory duty to promote the provision of advice and  information to the public about the design, commissioning and delivery of  health and social care. In addition, the RQIA monitors the Health Service  against a quality standard for health and social care on effective  communication and information. My Department has begun work already on a  service framework for older people. That will see the development of standards  that are designed to improve further the health and well-being of older people,  reduce inequalities, promote social inclusion, and improve the safety and  quality of care.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Our older people deserve the best possible care that we can  provide within the resources that we have been given. I am committed firmly to  improving continually the support that we provide to older people. Given that,  I make no apology about the fact that I will continue to press for more  resources and for better outcomes for those very vulnerable members of society.  I look forward to those Members who tabled the motion supporting my making that  case to ensure that more investment is made for the most vulnerable in our  community.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>: I  pay due regard to the elderly population and the invaluable contribution that  it makes to society. My constituency of North Down is enriched by the large  population of older people, which is growing continuously. Given Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  changing demographics and the increase in the population of older persons, this  debate is particularly relevant. Now is the time for proactive planning to  ensure that the values and practices that are inherent in the motion are converted  into reality for the older persons of tomorrow.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Many instances of good practice can be seen. For example,  in many of my constituency&rsquo;s surgeries, older persons and their carers pay  tribute to the quality of care that they have received. My evidence for that is  that a report of the Comptroller and Auditor General recorded the positive  experience of many older people who use the Health Service. It is vital that we  support and endorse that good practice.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, that has not always been the case, and I take it  as read that the Regulation and Quality Improvement Authority ensures effective  and efficient inspections. We must focus on the regularity of health provision,  its reliability, and, critically, its flexibility, with the requisite level of  monitoring and evaluation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We must listen actively to our older persons. They will  provide the critical information that will be necessary to ensure that our  health provision is tailor-made for them and that it meets individual needs  adequately. I welcome measures that the South Eastern Health and Social Care  Trust, which covers my constituency, has taken. Its planning is effective and  shows a detailed examination of the future needs of our expanding population of  older people. I welcome the increase in day-care admissions and the fact that  more complex surgeries can be undertaken on a day-care basis.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, that brings with it the challenge of ensuring that  domiciliary care is effective and appropriate to address the needs of older  persons who are coming out of hospital. With respect to that, it is imperative  that any specialist equipment that is required is offered equitably to those  utilising domiciliary care.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Multidisciplinary assessments are of the utmost importance,  and their timing is crucial. The evidence points strongly to the importance of  early assessment, so that, at the point of discharge, the service is ready for  the elderly person.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">How are we to achieve health provision that promotes  independence, while valuing the dignity of older people? The following areas  should have primacy. We must ensure that the RQIA provides comprehensive,  effective inspection. In promoting independence, we should see a shift in the  direction of funding towards domiciliary care, given that people in domiciliary  care should get access to the specialist equipment targeted to their assessed  need. Fundamentally, we want to see early multidisciplinary assessment of older  people so that there is no regression from the promotion of independence.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">1.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We should go further by promoting respite and sleepover  services, where appropriate, in the client&rsquo;s home. In these challenging times,  it is important that we promote job security in the private and voluntary  sector to enhance morale. Let us see effective use of the single assessment  tool; it might have been a long time in the making, but now that it is here, it  should be implemented rigorously. It is vital that good practice be shared and  that there be effective communication across all areas of our knowledge base.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I pay tribute to the people who are termed &ldquo;informal  carers&rdquo;. In many cases, those people are the heroes, so we should support them  with targeted respite. Their work promotes independence and helps people to  live at home for longer.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Buchanan said that we need properly trained staff to  look after the elderly and that the elderly&rsquo;s views must be taken into  consideration. Mickey Brady said that discrimination against older people needs  to be addressed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is unfortunate that the Ulster Unionists decided to  bring politics into the debate, given that we were not going to have a go at  the Minister today.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>A Member</strong>:  You will do it tomorrow.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  No, we will not do it tomorrow either.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McCallister complained about the motion &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span>. Do not worry, we have Lady Sylvia&rsquo;s vote  now.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McCallister complained about the motion and its timing.  If the Minister had bothered to turn up on the date on which the motion was  tabled previously, the motion would have been debated before the launch of the  European election campaign. The Member needs to get his facts right.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also remind the Member that the trusts&rsquo; proposals to  reduce the number of residential homes &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: On a point of order, Mr Deputy  Speaker. The Speaker and I have agreed on the timings of my appearances in the  House. However, those have been influenced by the international swine flu  crisis, about which I made a statement an hour ago. Therefore, Mr Easton should  not be able to make political capital from that point or play party politics  with it, which is exactly what he is doing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The fact is that I have responded to more debates in the  House than any other Minister. I have responded to 56 debates, which is many  times more than DUP Ministers. My nearest rival for appearances is Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s  Caitr&iacute;ona Ruane, who has responded to 36 or 38 debates. Margaret Ritchie has  responded to 28 debates. The number of debates that the other Ministers have  responded to is in the teens and single figures, which is where the DUP  Ministers can be found. Therefore, it is very unfortunate that Mr Easton is  using an issue such as swine flu to make a point and to play politics with an  international crisis. He is playing politics with matters that are crucial and  vital.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I thank the Minister for his point of order. The Business  Committee fully discussed and debated this issue, and, as every Member knows,  matters that the Business Committee debate are not for debate in the House.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  It is a pity that the Minister did not mention that it was his party that  raised the issue first. That is the reality. It would be interesting to see  what commitments the Minister had in his diary for the dates on which he did  not turn up.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McCallister complained about the trusts&rsquo; proposals to  reduce the number of residential homes. I point out that Mr McGimpsey is the  Minister in charge of the Health Department and that it is up to him to ensure  that there are no cuts made to front line services, residential homes and  nursing jobs. It is up to the Minister to ensure that those cuts do not happen.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mary Bradley complained about the treatment and  underfeeding of the elderly in hospital and blamed an over-bureaucratic system  for nurses&rsquo; workload. Kieran McCarthy said that he supports the motion, but  that he has concerns that parts of the Health Service are not already implementing  what the motion states.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Jim Shannon said that we all have family members who have  been affected by the issue, and I agree with him. He also said that we should  give the elderly the respect that they deserve and that he is concerned about  the lack of facilities for the elderly in the local community.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Ms Sue Ramsey said that resources need to be reconfigured  so that they are directed at elderly people and that the dignity of elderly  people must be promoted.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Sam Gardiner complained that the DUP has tabled more  motions on health than any other party, and I thank him for highlighting that  fact. Mr Gardiner spoke about cuts in the money that is available to the Health  Service; however, I remind him of the record investment that has been made in  the Health Service.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Carmel Hanna mentioned promotion of, and early intervention  for, elderly people. Claire McGill said that the Western Trust was moving  towards the integration of services, and she welcomed the promotion of the  dignity of elderly people. Dr Kieran Deeny said that the debate was worthwhile,  and he disagreed with the Ulster Unionist Party that the issue should not be  debated. He said that much can be learned from the wisdom of elderly people,  and I totally agree with that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Health Minister said that the elderly population is  increasing, and he highlighted the increase in resources that was supplied by  the DUP Finance Minister. I thank the Health Minister for that. More than half  the entire Budget for Northern    Ireland goes to health, and the Minister  needs to use it a bit more wisely. In a question for written answer<strong>, I </strong>asked the Minister whether he had  raised the matter of efficiency savings with the Executive. Judging from his  answer, the Minister has not bothered to raise that issue with the Executive. I  commend the motion to the House.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly calls on the Minister of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety to reconfigure and enhance services for older people  to ensure that these services are integrated, person-centred and well-staffed;  that the dignity of the individual is promoted; that information is  communicated effectively to patients and relatives by health professionals;  that inpatients receive a nutritional diet; and that personal care is provided  free of charge to all those with medical need.</p>
    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="5"></a>Private Members&rsquo; Business</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Restructuring of the Executive and Assembly</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30  minutes for the debate. The proposer will have 10 minutes to propose the motion  and 10 minutes to make a winding-up speech. All other Members who are called to  speak will have five minutes. One amendment has been selected and published on  the Marshalled List. The proposer of the amendment will have 10 minutes to  propose and five minutes to make a winding-up speech.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly supports, in principle, the restructuring  of the Northern Ireland Executive and the Assembly in order to improve the  efficiency and effectiveness of government; and calls on the First Minister and  deputy First Minister to update the Assembly on the proposals for the creation  of an Efficiency Review Panel, as announced on 9 April 2009, and to agree to  implement a review and produce a report on the issue of the number of MLAs and  government Departments in the next Assembly, within the next six months.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Unionist Party is relaxed with the amendment,  because we are confident in the merits of the motion; if the House thinks  differently, we shall let it choose what it favours. Our purpose is to generate  a worthwhile and open debate, secure in the knowledge that a very interested  public is listening.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The debate is not about the spectacle of double-jobbing,  family dynasties, dubious rents or the use of office-cost allowances, although,  we hope that, as an inevitable consequence of direct action on our motion, an  end to those controversies that highlight the issues will be in sight. Nor is  the debate about MPs&rsquo; expenses, food bills, rent overpay, second homes,  mortgages, capital gains, manure, furniture, moats or any other example of  acute embarrassment to those who have been exposed by &lsquo;The Daily Telegraph&rsquo;. Such  activities are a matter for another House to rectify.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, we cannot escape putting our own house in order;  the comparisons are too close for comfort. MLAs are under public scrutiny. Our  motion is about reform and about workable economies of scale that are designed  to combat wastage. The Assembly has moved on from the days when the Labour  Government contrived to enlarge MLA numbers solely to bring in diverse groups.  Those groups might have contributed, but that was then, and this is now in much  better circumstances.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly feels a more settled place in which to conduct  business. Even that arch-sceptic and font of wisdom Lord Morrow acknowledges  the catchphrase that we are moving on, although, like many, I suspect that he  reserves the right to question the precise direction in which we are moving.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That begs the obvious question: has the initial initiative  of getting us here in the first place, through my party&rsquo;s heavy lifting, been  successful to the point that those of us who are here are prepared to move on?  Are we ready to move on under our own steam and to restructure and reorganise  at a pace with which the electorate can identify and support? Are we willing to  act in the lifetime of this Assembly to scale down ministerial posts and reduce  the number of MLAs? In other words, is that a serious proposition on which we  are prepared to deliver?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although the Assembly seems to be content to continue with  British rule under devolved arrangements, I do not believe that the current  Executive structure can last. I am less confident, therefore, that moving on  will bring the Assembly closer to the real test of its maturity, which is the  shift from an enforced mandatory coalition to a voluntary coalition. This  moving on caper is all well and good when the direction is clear and not  littered with obstacles and uncertainty, as has been illustrated recently in  debates and votes on the economy, in heated debates on the Programme for  Government and its budgetary outworkings, in stormy debates on the education  stalemate, and by the fact that there is little prospect of agreement, so far,  on the devolution of policing and justice.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, room should be made for us to reflect on the context  of where we started, where we are now, and where we are going. We must be big  enough to give due recognition to how far the institution has progressed in a  relatively short time. Without the efforts of the original First Minister, the  Executive and the Assembly of that time, and, indeed, without the giant step  that was taken by the previous First Minister, Dr Paisley, and the stepping  into his large shoes by the current First Minister, we would probably not be  here. The thought of debating this motion, or any other motion, in the Assembly  may well have been aborted some time ago.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That said, no one could fail to notice that as recently as  Monday 11 May 2009, the deputy First Minister stepped in and dismissed  proposals that the First Minister put forward for various efficiency measures,  including streamlining the Office of the First Minister and deputy First  Minister (OFMDFM), the merger of the Equality Commission, the Human Rights  Commission and the post of Commissioner for Children and Young People, having  fewer Departments and MLAs, and, lo and behold, the phasing out of double  jobbing. The deputy First Minister described it as &ldquo;shallow electioneering&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Therein lies the problem with moving on, especially when  Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s terms and conditions clearly do not fit in with those of unionists.  The Assembly has a duty to deal with differences and to decide, urgently, how  best to restore the integrity of our profession and win back large swathes of a  disillusioned electorate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Long before &lsquo;The Daily Telegraph&rsquo; unfolded its graphic  disclosures of goings on at Westminster, MLAs &mdash; and this affects us all &mdash; were  subject to ridicule in the media, abuse on phone-in shows, which still happens,  and newspaper comments such as, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time some politicians voted themselves  out of a job&rdquo;, followed by, &ldquo;One MLA for every 16,000 of us? We have let too  many in already.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Surely, those are reasons enough for the Assembly to agree  to the Ulster Unionist Party&rsquo;s motion and good reason to show the public that  it accepts that top-heaviness is detrimental to our effectiveness. Those are  good reasons to show that rather than talk the talk, we will make good on and  implement the necessary improvements.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Only the motion conveys that message to the public, and  only the motion calls for a review of the number of MLAs and a timescale to  report within six months. The amendment fudges on the aspect of support in  principle; in fact, it deletes the words &ldquo;in principle&rdquo; from the motion. It  also shies away from a review of MLA numbers when such a review is crucial, and  it removes any reference to a timescale. Is that it? Is the solution to simply  put the matter off, as we do normally?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I acknowledge and welcome the OFMDFM commit&shy;ment, which  offers to establish an efficiency review panel to examine the Departments and  to release a report later this year. It said that it would establish the panel  after Easter &mdash; there is no sign of it yet &mdash; and produce the report thereafter.  However, the OFMDFM proposal does not include a review of MLA numbers.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Our motion is specific in relation to Departments, MLAs and  timescale. In my most persuasive manner, I urge Members to reconsider the  motion and the amendment carefully and to think of the electorate who voted us  into the House. We are not debating actual numbers. We will do that on another  day, sooner rather than later. If Members want to support the amendment, they  can suit themselves. However, such a move will stop short of decisive action,  which is something of which we are repeatedly accused.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Support for the motion will signal to the public that our  unanimous &mdash; I emphasise unanimous &mdash; intention is to provide an opportunity for  them to vote for a new-look Stormont Assembly at the next election. That is the  right signal to send, and only the Ulster Unionist motion sends that signal. We  are public servants who are employed by the public, who expect us to act  responsibly. The people deserve no less, and, ultimately, we will all be judged  at the ballot box.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I trust that today&rsquo;s debate will be open. Ulster Unionists  will voice their opinion against the amendment and, if the House divides, will  vote accordingly. Only the motion is worth supporting, and I commend it to  Members.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>: I  beg to move the following amendment: Leave out all after &ldquo;supports&rdquo; and insert</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;improving the efficiency and effectiveness of  government; recognises the need for new scrutiny and oversight arrangements in  the Assembly to permanently pursue such ends; calls on the First and deputy  First Minister to make a statement on their proposals for an Efficiency Review  Panel; notes the review procedures set out in the Belfast Agreement and the  Northern Ireland Act 1998 to provide for agreed changes to the institutions,  including the size and structure of the Assembly and the institutional workings  of the Executive; further notes the role of the Assembly and Executive Review  Committee in examining such matters; calls on that Committee to accelerate  consideration of changes to the number of MLAs and the number of government  Departments; and asks it to produce a report this year outlining proposals  which respect the principles of proportional representation and inclusion.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McNarry began by saying that he and his party colleagues  were relaxed about the Assembly&rsquo;s decision to support or reject the amendment  before going on to outline several false arguments against the amendment. The  motion seems to ask the First Minister and deputy First Minister to provide a  statement that offers an update on their proposals for an efficiency review  panel. The SDLP amendment also asks the First Minister and deputy First  Minister to make a statement to the House on that matter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion calls for a report to be produced within six  months, whereas the amendment asks for a report this year, which is not much  longer than six months. Mr McNarry suggested that the amendment did not outline  a timescale and did not mention a report. The amendment states that the  Assembly and Executive Review Committee should consider the matter and report  this year. Mr McNarry said that the amendment does not address the number of  MLAs. It does: the amendment specifically states that the Assembly and  Executive Review Committee should introduce proposals on the number of MLAs and  Departments. Therefore, all issues are addressed, and the timetable is  accommodated.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We commend the amendment to the House because it is more  considered and possibly more competent. We do not necessarily agree that the  First Minister and deputy First Minister should make proposals on the number of  MLAs. A review procedure was built into the Good Friday Agreement. Moreover, it  is reflected in legislation, and supplementary review aspects were built in  through the creation of the Assembly and Executive Review Committee. Therefore,  the amendment tries to reflect the statutory reality, the spirit of the agreement  and the arrangements that are in place. We want to adhere to those proper  review mechanisms.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The First Minister and deputy First Minister should not  decide on the number of MLAs. The Assembly can competently address that matter  through the Committee and can process the issue through a proper review  mechanism under the terms of the agreement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Remember that the First Minister and deputy First Minister  have not even been elected by the Assembly, which is unlike the original  Assembly. Therefore, it is not within their mandate to bring forward those  kinds of issues. They have many other burdens and responsibilities, and lots of  things have been promised to be delivered by that Department within months that  have not actually been delivered.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am not sure that the most positive way of promoting  action on those significant issues is to remit them to the First Minister and  deputy First Minister through some other panel. People want to see MLAs,  politicians and parties taking a handle on those issues and not constantly  handing things out to other worthies and experts. We are the people who are  paid the money and the allowances and we should be working in the Assembly and  using the structures that were created. If people went out of their way to  create an Assembly and Executive Review Committee to deal with such matters,  let us use that Committee for that purpose, rather than creating a Committee  and then getting someone else to do the job. That is what the public complain  about and that is what our amendment attempts to avoid.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We also recognise that it is not just the number of MLAs  and Departments that must be considered. Yet again, the SDLP is making the  point that improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the Government  requires some new Assembly scrutiny and oversight mechanisms. We hear a lot of  talk about joined-up Government, but we do not get it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One of the things that we do not have in the Assembly is  joined-up scrutiny. We do not have a Committee that has the competence of a  ways-and-means Committee or Budget Committee. The Committee for Finance and  Personnel does not and cannot play that role. The Department of Finance and  Personnel does not play a strong role in policing the performance and practice  of Government expenditure across Departments: most of its time is spent on  Budget-planning matters.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP has argued for the creation of new Assembly  Committees with powers, not unlike the Public Accounts Committee, to call in  people from Departments and non-departmental bodies. We suggest that the  Assembly and Executive Review Committee considers the establishment of a  Committee that is permanently dedicated to interrogating the cost of the  Government. That matter should not be dealt with in a one-off review aimed at  reducing the number of Departments, although many people would find that useful.  There should be a Committee that is permanently dedicated to interrogating how  much the Government and the Departments are spending on themselves. It would be  better than the Public Accounts Committee, which can only look at things after  the fact and tends to concentrate on secondary and tertiary budget holders. The  proposed Committee would test what the Government and the Departments are doing  with the big budgets and their big spending on themselves in real time.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Those are positive ideas, as is the idea of a Committee to  permanently oversee capital expenditure across all Departments. We hear a lot  of complaints about the effectiveness, performance and delivery of Departments.  Even in the context of the headline figures for capital expenditure and the  investment strategy, there are complaints about delivery.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly is supposed to be a chamber of accountability  and a theatre of scrutiny and challenge. Let us use it as such, and let us  equip it with the proper tools of scrutiny and challenge. That is why our  motion identifies the need for new measures and mechanisms.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP does not shy away from the issue of the number of  MLAs. When the Good Friday Agreement was being negotiated, we proposed  constituencies with five seats. On the basis that there were 18 constituencies  at the time, that would have delivered 90 MLAs. It was essentially the  intervention of the British Government that led to each constituency having six  seats. Some of us preferred to add 10 extra seats to the proposed 90 in the  first Assembly as a way of trying to accommodate the interests of some of the  smaller parties that had been involved in negotiating the Agreement. However, a  model of constituencies with six seats in each was chosen. That gives us an  Assembly that, in most people&rsquo;s estimation, is too large. The SDLP is in favour  of reducing it, and has suggested ways of doing that; for instance, by reducing  the number of Northern    Ireland constituencies.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Boundary Commission says that Northern Ireland should have  between 16 and 18 parliamentary constituencies. If the number were reduced to  16, with five seats in each constituency, the number of MLAs would be reduced  by 28.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That would give us a reasonably sized Assembly of 80  Members. If, after further reviews in Westminster,  there are other reductions to the size of Parliament, the number of  constituency seats here will be lower. If we continue to use parliamentary  constituencies as Assembly constituencies, that will result in a smaller Assembly.  Contrary to what the DUP and others alleged last week, we have put forward  proposals in the past. We made those proposals during the review of the Good  Friday Agreement that occurred before the talks at Leeds  Castle, and we were meant to  participate in a review at Leeds   Castle, but that was  aborted.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We do not shy away from the issue of reducing the number of  Departments. It is strange that some of the parties that make a big deal about  reducing the number of Departments are in the business of increasing the number  of Departments to accommodate the devolution of justice and policing. We do not  need an extra Department for justice and policing; we could easily rejig our  complement of Departments and still fit in a Department of justice without  adding to the existing 10. Other parties have decided that they want to go  above 10, because they want to use the false and dishonest excuse of bypassing  the d&rsquo;Hondt mechanism. They are contriving to create more Departments while  pretending that they are trying to reduce them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are serious about reducing the number of Departments. We  do not necessarily buy the figure of six that many people have proposed. When  we had six Departments here, they proved unwieldy and were not competent or  convincing in dealing with the range of policy interests that faced them.  Furthermore, we are not sure how much accountability those Departments would be  subject to in the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  Will the Member advise the House how the SDLP voted on the establishment of a  Department of justice? Is it not the case that his party supported the creation  of an additional Department of justice? The SDLP did not argue for a reduction  of the 10 Departments in that instance.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  The Member is wrong. In an earlier submission, we made the point that  devolution of policing and justice could and should be done in the way that I  described. There was no reason why it should not have been done that way.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member must draw his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  We recognised the way in which others were going. The amendment competently  addresses all the issues that the proposer&rsquo;s party wanted to deal with, but  does so more convincingly, more properly and in a more orderly way. The  amendment ensures that the Assembly will have responsibility for the matter and  does not kick it somewhere else.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I support the motion in the genuine spirit in which it was moved. I oppose the  amendment, because I remain to be convinced that the SDLP is genuinely  committed to reducing the number of Departments in Northern Ireland and the number of  Assembly Members, which is the thrust of the motion. That was betrayed by some  of Mr Durkan&rsquo;s comments. I welcome the fact that we are discussing the  restructuring and streamlining of Government in Northern Ireland. Since the  inception of the Belfast Agreement and the bloated political bureaucracy that  was borne out of it in subsequent years, my party has been a lone voice in  calling for a reduction in the number of Departments and Assembly Members.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Whatever reason there was for having six-seat  constituencies and 108 MLAs, there was no justification for it in a country the  size of Northern Ireland,  just as there was never a justification for having 10, 11 or 12 Departments.  There are relevant examples not too far away from here in other devolved  regions. In Scotland,  for example, MSP representation is significantly lower per head of population  and, more importantly, there was a recent reduction in Departments from nine to  six. That makes the point that a country with a population much larger than  ours can function perfectly adequately with significantly fewer Departments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The context for today&rsquo;s debate is provided by the motion  that was moved by my party and passed by the Assembly on 19 January 2009, which  called on the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister to reduce  the number of Departments. I welcome the intention to create an efficiency  review panel, which is the focus of Mr McNarry&rsquo;s motion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Having had that discussion, which is culminating in today&rsquo;s  debate, I am pleased that we have made some conversions. After being the lone  voice for those years, it is gratifying to my party that there have been  conversions, particularly from the parties of the two Members who spoke last.  Those parties are principally responsible for the bloated bureaucracy that we  are in the midst of today.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also wish to make some general points concerning the  value that my party puts on driving efficiency into the heart of Government. If  one looks at our record since devolution, in only two years, there have been  many examples of the DUP and DUP Ministers driving the principle of more  efficient Government into the DNA of Departments and agencies. I accept that we  are not alone in doing that, but we are the principal drivers of that reform  agenda into the heart of Government in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In particular, I am thinking of some of the conclusions of  the review of public administration (RPA), including the reduction of the  number of councils from 26 to 11, the creation of the performance and  efficiency delivery unit, and the creation of the strategic projects unit,  which is fast-tracking major planning applications. Furthermore, we have been  driving the general reform of the Civil Service, including the introduction of  the three-digit contact number. Those and other examples of reform are driving  more efficient interfacing with the public and the more efficient delivery of  public services in general.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My party takes those things seriously, places value on them  and is glad to see them happening. However, that is not where it stops, nor  should it be where things end for Departments or MLAs. There is a convincing  case for looking at bodies such as the Equality Commission, the Human Rights  Commission and other commissions, without turning our backs on the principles  of equality or human rights. Although we value and cherish those principles, we  do not cherish or value the need for separate commissions, and there are  convincing cases for considering reducing their number in order to streamline  them and save money.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We must all embrace the need to reduce the size of  Government and to streamline structures in Stormont and elsewhere. When Mr  McNarry proposed the motion, he said that there must be buy-in from other  parties. I accept that point, but we must all embrace the whole agenda. In the  past, there was posturing indicating that there would be no changes to  accountability; however, we have seen changes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member should draw his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  Margaret Ritchie has learnt to her cost &mdash; or, rather, to the cost of &pound;300,000  to the ratepayers &mdash; that changes have been made. We must all embrace this  agenda and drive it forward, because the people of Northern Ireland are looking to us  and demanding that we do so. I welcome the motion and I reject the amendment.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Chomhairle. I have listened closely to the  contributions thus far, and my party remains unconvinced by the motivation  behind the motion and that behind the amendment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Political parties here were recently given an opportunity  to show their commitment to efficient Government. All but Sinn F&eacute;in fell at the  last hurdle, because Sinn F&eacute;in was the only party that, in the interest of  achieving a number of objectives, including the efficient and effective  delivery of services and value for money, went for the seven-council option in  the RPA recommendations. That was a test for parties. Parties around the  Chamber talked about how they would reduce the number of MLAs, Departments and  bodies, but when they were given the option to do so, every party apart from  mine went for 11, 15 or 17 councils, and some secretly hoped that the number  would remain at 26. That was all about &ldquo;saving our seats&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I remember the debate in this Chamber during the Hain  Assembly, as it was referred to. I left that debate, and the title that I gave  it was the &ldquo;save our seats&rdquo; debate. I strongly suspect that when the elections  are out of the road, the dust has settled and it comes to making the crucial  decisions about how many MLAs will sit in the Chamber and how many Departments  and advisers there will be, etc, some of the political parties that are making  strong statements today about reducing bureaucracy and the number of  Departments will fall at the last fence.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Another concern that my party has about the motion relates  to the issue of electioneering. Indeed, Mr McNarry referred to something that  Martin McGuinness said about that matter. That is, electioneering not only with  respect to efficiencies, but with respect to the removal of equality, which  goes to the heart of this institution and the institutions that are built  around it. This institution is built fairly and squarely on the foundations of  the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are still those on the Benches opposite and the  Benches to my left who believe that they will hollow out the equality  mechanisms of the Good Friday Agreement; that they will return to the  one-party-rule system of the old Stormont; and that they will not have to share  power with their nationalist and republican neighbours. Until they realise that  those days are over, and that those days did not serve anybody well,  particularly the communities that they represent, we will continue to have  these silly debates on reducing the number of Departments under the headline of  efficiency savings.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  The Member has made the same argument on previous occasions. Will he not accept  that it is ridiculous to suggest that a reduction in the number of Departments  and Assembly Members is in no way compatible with what he has already said? In  any of those circumstances, we all accept that Northern Ireland cannot be governed  in the way in which it was 50 years ago. There can still be protections for  minority rights within Northern    Ireland. That is not incompatible with a  reduction in the number of Departments and Members.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  It can be done, but I regret that the statement from Mr Hamilton is not backed  up by actions from his party colleagues. I still strongly suspect that there  are those in the DUP who believe that they will someday return to this  institution in a one-party state, and they will not be protecting the rights  and entitlements of the minority &mdash; &ldquo;minority&rdquo; is the wrong term &mdash; of  communities within this society. They are not interested in sharing power with  their nationalist and republican neighbours.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As long as Sinn F&eacute;in is the second-largest party in the  Executive, and, therefore, the largest nationalist and republican party in the  Executive, we will not accept any measures that undermine the entitlements of  the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As regards the number of Members, 108 is excessive, but  remember where we have come from and how the agreement was formatted. We are a  society coming out of conflict. We have had 30 or 40 years of terrible  conflict, and the reason that we have so many MLAs is to allow alternative  voices to represent communities from all sectors of our society.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">What price democracy? Due to the reports of the expenditure  of those in the British Westminster system who are abusing the responsibility  placed on them by the public, some members of the public are quite rightly  asking whether they can afford those politicians. I ask this: can we afford not  to have politicians? Politicians have brought normality to this society. Not all  politicians are milking the system. Not all politicians are living the high  life. Not all politicians entered public service out of self-interest. There  are those, and I rank my colleagues among them, who have entered politics  because they believe in the supremacy of politics. Politics can and should be  used to bring positive change into people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are in our first real term of the institutions that were  established under the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member draw his remarks to a close?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Let these institutions complete their task and allow the efficiency review  panel that has been established under the Office of the First Minister and  deputy First Minister to report. First and foremost, it will report on  equality.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: I  support the motion and thank the proposers for bringing it today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Members are aware, the Alliance Party has a wide agenda  for reforming these institutions and the system of government in Northern Ireland.  We have been very open and honest about that. We are on record as having sought  progressive changes to these institutions, whether through designations in the  voting system; moving from a mandatory to a voluntary coalition system; or  making better use of the North/South institutions to bring maximum benefit to  the people of Northern    Ireland. The size and nature of government  in Northern Ireland  has to be included in those considerations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It goes without saying that the number of Departments is a  critical part of that agenda, as is the number of MLAs who sit on these  Benches.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to address several issues. I will reflect on the  contribution of the previous Member who spoke. I agree that we should all acknowledge  that our current arrangements exist for a reason. Our political structure was  designed to fulfil the needs of a peace process rather than to promote good and  efficient government. Members need to acknowledge that. It is much harder to  sustain the argument that that political structure should remain for ever and a  day because of its genesis.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have a large number of Members to ensure inclusion and  proportionality. However, inclusion and proportionality can be achieved if the  number of Members is reduced by altering the number of constituencies so that  there are still multi-Member constituencies. That is one option. The number of  Departments can also be inclusive and proportional provided one either examines  the management of government &mdash; a different level of proportionality may be  required in the transition period &mdash; or puts more emphasis on the role of  opposition within good government. The latter option is preferable because if  those outside Government are properly funded and supported to challenge Government,  that is good for all people.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The efficiency review panel has already been tasked with  examining the number of MLAs and Departments, and it has been stated that it  will report by the end of the year. Therefore, our only question about the  motion is what it adds, apart from a month or two to the reporting time; there  is little more to be gained from it. However, we have no objection to that  report being published sooner rather than later.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We also have no doubt that a reduction in the number of Departments  would produce financial savings; no one could argue against that. However, I am  wary that the level of financial savings has, at times, been significantly  overstated. I think, for example, of the scant attention that is given to the  cost of division, which runs at around &pound;1 billion per annum and is, by  comparison, a black hole in the Budget. Therefore, perspective is required.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The main objective of reform of the institutions is to  deliver more effective and efficient government, which we have made clear on  several occasions. With the planned reduction in the number of councils from 26  to 11 as part of the RPA, it is logical that the number of Departments be  reviewed. Councils will take on additional powers, including some that reside  with central Departments. Therefore, there is an opportunity for efficiency.  The new Health and Social Care Board and the proposed education and skills  authority will also take work away from their host Departments, which presents  opportunities for efficiencies.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It can be argued that 11 Departments mean that there is  distribution of responsibility on many issues, which can lead to little being  achieved. I could give a number of examples, but the one that exercises me also  exercised the House recently: school-age childcare. A number of Departments  claim an interest in that issue, but no one will take responsibility and  address the problem.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member draw her remarks to a close?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>:  Although we support the motion, we favour a focus on the more effective and  efficient delivery of good governance. It is important that we do not overstate  the potential financial savings, but we acknowledge that significant financial  savings could be made.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question Time will commence at 2.30 pm. I suggest that Members  take their ease until that time. This debate will continue after Question Time,  and Alastair Ross will be the first Member to speak.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The debate stood suspended.</p>

    <p class="OralWrittenAnswersHeading"><a name="6"></a>Oral Answers to Questions</p>
    <p class="H3SectionHeading">Office of the First Minister and deputy First  Minister</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Aid for Peace Approach</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mr P  Ramsey </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister if  the &lsquo;Aid for Peace Approach&rsquo; is applied in assessment of all programmes that it  funds.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO2711/09> (AQO 2711/09)</a></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister (Mr P Robinson)</strong>: The Aid for Peace approach is an evaluation  methodology for examining peace-building interventions. It has been used in  developing the Peace III programme and was also applied in Peace III at an  operational level, as part of the monitoring and evaluation strategy. It should  provide a fuller indication of the impact of EU peace funding than any  previously available approach.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The lead partner of each project is taken through the  stages of the Aid for Peace approach by a facilitator. It is not expected that  the approach will be onerous for EU-funded projects. Although the evaluation  model is not used directly in the assessment of programmes that are funded by  OFMDFM, the four key elements of the EU process will be part of our  decision-making. Analysing issues such as peace-building needs, how programmes  address identified needs and the impacts that are being achieved is an  essential and routine components of our programme and policy process.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  I thank the First Minister for his response. When did he become aware that  Frankie Gallagher and other members of the UPRG had left Farset and taken up  employment with another special European programme-funded body?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I am not aware that they have. I understood that Mr Gallagher had  been involved with the CTI project, which was unlawfully stopped by the  Minister from the Member&rsquo;s party. Neither I nor, I believe, the deputy First  Minister have been made aware of any termination of employment at the CTI  project &mdash; indeed, nor should we be because it is the responsibility of the  Minister from the Member&rsquo;s party rather than mine.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  Will the First Minister indicate how the Aid for Peace scheme will work in  relation to local government? I understand that with Peace I and II there was a  relationship with local government in the allocation of funds. It is important  for local government to be involved with this scheme, because it would have the  avenues to the projects that might be awarded funding.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: We should be clear that although the Aid for Peace approach is  set out in the four categories that are identified under the EU process, they  are probably just common sense and will be used by anyone who is assessing those  projects, whether in central, regional or local government.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The first element is an analysis of the conflict dynamics  and in particular the peace-building process. There is then an assessment of  whether an intervention is relevant to the needs of peace-building before  moving to conflict risk assessment, assessing and identifying problems and  risks with which projects and interventions might be confronted. Finally, there  is the peace and conflict effects assessment, examining the effects of an  intervention and assessing what changes have occurred. All of those seem to me  to be the sort of questions that one would need to assess in local government  or elsewhere, whether one uses the Aid for Peace approach or any other  approach.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Robert  Coulter</strong>: Will the First Minister comment on the criticisms by the Northern  Ireland Statistics and Research Agency that the Aid for Peace approach is not  being evaluated properly and that impacts over a period of time need to be  assessed, as well as more immediate inputs and outcomes?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I would be happy to have officials make an assessment and,  perhaps, even to speak to NISRA about their criticisms.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">No matter what Department is involved, it is important that  the Government use the best methodology when making assessments of any project.  If improve&shy;ments can be made, it is right and proper that officials learn what  they are.</p>
    <p class="H5StageHeading">Cross-sector Advisory Forum</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mrs D  Kelly </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister to  outline the relationship between the cross-sector advisory forum and the  Economic Development Forum. <a name=AQO2712/09>(AQO 2712/09)</a></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: On 20 April, during my statement to the Assembly on the  cross-sector advisory forum (CSAF), I made specific reference to the work of  the Economic Development Forum (EDF). We are keenly aware of the valuable work  that the EDF does, and it is not our intention to unnecessarily duplicate that  effort in the cross-sector advisory forum. The CSAF&rsquo;s terms of reference  clearly state its purpose, which is to make recommendations for addressing the  problems arising from the economic crisis. That forum is rooted firmly in  dealing with the effects of the economic downturn. The Economic Development Forum  has a role to provide advice and recommendations to the Executive on matters  relating to the development of the local economy within the context set by the  Programme for Government. The EDF&rsquo;s remit is focused on improving the strength  of our economy, even in normal times.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">During the CSAF&rsquo;s first meeting on 6 April, reference was  made to the work of the EDF. There is consensus that there will be a  complementary relationship between the EDF and the CSAF. It is also worth  noting that we anticipate that the cross-sector advisory forum will bring  forward proposals for social welfare, as well as economic responses to the  current crisis.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his response. How often has it met, and when will it  report to the House?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I assume that the &ldquo;it&rdquo; refers to the cross-sector advisory forum.  As I said, the cross-sector advisory forum met in April. At that meeting, we  agreed that we would meet before the summer recess but, importantly, that the  main work of the forum could be done through work groups that would be set up  to cover a range of seven different subjects. We were looking for an input, not  just from the various interests in the cross-sector advisory forum, each of  whom will be asked what groups they want to be part of, but from the  appropriate Ministers in those Departments.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>:  What steps have the Executive taken to address the economic downturn?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: Each Minister in the Executive is focused on dealing with their  departmental responsi&shy;bilities on matters relating to the downturn. As we have  already indicated, the establishment of the cross-sector advisory forum was  important in that it flowed out of a series of meetings that the deputy First Minister  and I had with banks, the construction industry, energy companies, the energy  regulator, the Institute   of Directors and other  business interests. We met the voluntary and community sector and the trade  unions. We had a series of meetings, and the feedback that we received was that  a body of this type would be useful.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In respect of the Member&rsquo;s wider question, in December, my  colleague the Minister of Finance and Personnel brought before the Assembly  proposals aimed at helping businesses and, in particular, small businesses, as  well as households in hardship, particularly in relation to fuel poverty. DETI  has increased its support for debt advisory services to local people, and we  have fast-tracked support services for businesses. We have also improved  support services for unemployed people through the jobs and benefits offices,  and we have used capital spending in our investment strategy to support  construction. The investment strategy is almost twice the size that it was in  the previous comprehensive spending review period. At between &pound;1&middot;4 and &pound;1&middot;5  billion, it can fill a significant gap, because of the downturn in housing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have been meeting the banks, and we will continue to do  that. We met a number of the sectoral interests during that time.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">An update on the economic downturn is a key item at every  Executive meeting. Each Minister reports on how it is affecting their  Department, the Executive consider what steps can be taken. As we approach the  June monitoring round, the Finance Minister will look at that issue again and,  as part of the June review, we will seek proposals for changes not only from  the Executive but, because we are happy to receive them, from Assembly Members  and the public.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Members acknowledge that the Budget and Programme for Government prioritise the  economy; however, if the cross-sector advisory forum or the Economic Development  Forum recommend that either document must be recast with a different emphasis  on the economy, will the First Minister and the Executive follow that advice?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: The deputy First Minister, I and all our colleagues will take  advice that we are given from experts on the economy very seriously. Let me be  clear: the deputy First Minister and I did not create this body as some kind of  optics for the public; the body is there to facilitate a partnership with  business and other sectors of the community so that we can best respond to the  economic downturn. That is what we intend to do, even if it is unpleasant and  requires difficult changes.</p>
    <p class="H5StageHeading">Equality Commission</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Ms  Anderson </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister  what action it is taking to ensure that the Equality Commission builds  confidence across all communities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2713/09>(AQO  2713/09)</a></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: The Equality Commission&rsquo;s draft corporate plan for the next three  years, that is, 2009-2012, was subject to a 12-week consultation that ended on  12 January 2009. The draft is with Ministers for approval. In its draft plan, a  key strategic priority of the commission is to reach out to the whole  community.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The deputy First Minister and I recognise that the Equality  Commission must ensure that it builds confidence across all sections of the  community and all communities. As the funding Department for the Equality  Commission for Northern Ireland,  the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister is accountable for  the commission&rsquo;s resourcing arrange&shy;ments and business activities. In that  context, the deputy First Minister and I approved the commission&rsquo;s three-year  corporate plan. Our Department must approve the commission&rsquo;s annual business  plan. It also carries out reviews of the commission every five years or so. The  next is scheduled for 2009-2010.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">OFMDFM receives quarterly performance reports from the  commission on its progress towards achieving its aim, objective and target, as  set out in the commission&rsquo;s annual business plan. In turn, OFMDFM officials  consider the contents of those quarterly reports and request further details as  appropriate. Our officials also meet commission staff on a bimonthly basis to  discuss various issues, including the outworking of the business and corporate  plans. Formal meetings at senior management level take place on a quarterly  basis.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. I thank the First Minister for his answer. I appreciate  his recognition that the Equality Commission must build confidence across  society. However, given the First Minister&rsquo;s stated position last week on the  continuing function of the Equality Commission and other commissions, does he understand  or accept that, although the SDLP may be willing to remove what it regards as  the &ldquo;ugly scaffolding&rdquo; of equality and power-sharing arrangements, Sinn F&eacute;in is  not prepared to alter or dilute those safeguards, which are for everyone in  this society?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I will not enter into the electoral battle that is under way. I  will allow others to take up cudgels on that issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will make it very clear: the proposal that I and my  colleagues made last week was not to abolish the issue of equality, because  those matters can still be dealt with. The reality is that the plethora of  commissions raises the question of whether there is value and economy in  bringing a number of their tasks together into one commission. That is a matter  of efficiency rather than abolition. I believe that there is a very good case  for bringing together at least three of those commissions.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  Does the First Minister agree that one reason for a lack of confidence in the  Equality Commission among the unionist community is the utterly  unrepresentative nature of its commissioners? Given that the Secretary of State  is in the process of making additional appointments, does the First Minister  agree that it is imperative that the Secretary of State does not repeat the mistakes  of the past and that he ensures that those appointments are reflective of the  whole community in Northern    Ireland?</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: As the Member who asked the previous question indicated, there is  a common thread: we all want those who are responsible within the Equality  Commission to be representative of the community and to work for all sections  of the community. It is imperative that the commission is itself representative  of the community &mdash; regrettably, the present commission is not &mdash; and that its  staff are representative of the community, too.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is very hard for the Equality Commission to preach to  others if its own statistics do not indicate the broad strengths of the various  communities. I think that the commission&rsquo;s present work force breaks down as  34% Protestant and 64% Roman Catholic. That is clearly not representative of  the community, so the Equality Commission has work to do. It would be in a much  better position to go out and encourage others if it could show that it has been  able to deal with that issue itself.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  I thank the Member who asked the main question for her choice of colour today.  It has added brightness to the Chamber, and it has reassured me vis-&agrave;-vis the  Equality Commission. Does the First Minister agree that there is still a strong  residual suspicion of the Equality Commission throughout the unionist  community? What steps does he believe must be taken to address that deep-seated  perception?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: Ms Anderson&rsquo;s outfit is almost Day-Glo; I should have brought my  shades into the Chamber.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The unionist community&rsquo;s concerns about the Equality  Commission stem largely from the issue that was raised by the Member for  Strangford Mr Hamilton, namely its unrepresentative nature. If someone wants to  speak to the Equality Commission, they are inclined to consider who in the  commission shares their broad ethos, way of life and outlook. The unionist  community finds it difficult to make that kind of identification, and one can  see why that is so when one looks at the statistics.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  What additional resources have been provided to the commission? Are there any  outstanding legislative amendments that the commission requires to fulfil its  responsibilities?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: The key areas in which there is a requirement for changes to be  made are matters that are clearly within the scope of either the Secretary of  State, who makes appointments, or of the commission itself, which makes its  staffing arrangements. More than anywhere else, it is those areas in which  there is a lack of confidence.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If the Equality Commission indicates to the deputy First  Minister and me that there is a requirement for more resources in order to be  able to pursue the kind of projects about which we have been talking &mdash; encouraging  equality among all communities &mdash; we will, of course, look at that and, no  doubt, have to discuss with the Finance Minister.</p>
    <p class="H5StageHeading">Strategic Investment Board: Chief Executive</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mr  Kennedy </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister  for an assessment of the salary of the chief executive of the Strategic  Investment Board, which was recently quoted in the &lsquo;Daily Mail&rsquo;, and if it  believes it is appropriate, or in the public interest, for any public body in  Northern Ireland to be paying salaries at this level.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2714/09>(AQO 2714/09)</a></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: The Strategic Investment Board (SIB) was conceived during the  first period of devolution and was established by direct rule Ministers. The  present SIB chief executive was recruited under direct rule. I understand that  his terms and conditions were subject to scrutiny by the Department of Finance  and Personnel and by Her Majesty&rsquo;s Treasury before being agreed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although we fully accept that the chief executive of SIB is  highly paid, he is not in the top 10 of public sector chief executives, as the  newspaper claimed. The Strategic Investment Board has played a key role in  helping to raise infrastructure investment to record levels over the past five  years. In 2003-04, only &pound;680 million was invested; in 2008-09, the total is  expected to be in the region of &pound;1&middot;5 billion. Not only are we achieving record  investment, but we now deliver it through a coherent investment strategy that  ensures that it is targeted at the Executive&rsquo;s key Programme for Government priorities  so that it will deliver the best outcomes for all of our people.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">SIB was established as a limited company with a board of  directors. That enables it to operate with a degree of independence from the  rest of the public sector and to recruit the skills and the experience that is  needed to do the job that Ministers set for it. Many of the critical skills  required to achieve the acceleration of investment effort, which is vital in  achieving the aims of the Programme for Government, are simply not available in  the public sector; therefore, SIB has had to look outside the public sector for  scarce skills. That means that for some key jobs it has to be prepared to pay  market rates, which are often considered higher than those in the public  sector.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I am grateful to the First Minister for his reply. Does his Department have any  plans to review the appointments process for executive and non-executive  members of the SIB, and are there any plans to review the overall work of the  SIB? Can the First Minister provide an update on the review of the investment  strategy for Northern    Ireland, which is part of the SIB?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: There is a periodic review of the SIB. When I was Minister of  Finance, I came to the Executive when we were looking at the issue of asset  management, the sale of assets and the SIB&rsquo;s role in that. I said to colleagues  that it was useful to have a review of the SIB and its operations. That review  is due to take place this year, and it can look at the wider issues. It is worth  pointing out that the chief executive retains his salary unless he resigns or  retires or if a review reconsiders the role that he and others play in the  organisation. Such a review would have to come before Executive colleagues.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I call Mr Jonathan Ross.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I  am still Alastair Ross, Mr Deputy Speaker. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span> I notice that the other Deputy Speaker is rubbing off on you.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We should be focusing on the overall performance of the  SIB, but can the First Minister offer any views on how the &lsquo;Daily Mail&rsquo; came to  misreport the salary of the chief executive of the SIB?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: My apologies, Mr Ross.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I am glad that my colleague raises the issue of the &lsquo;Daily Mail&rsquo;,  as it exaggerates and gets figures wrong consistently, not just on this issue.  However, an investigation would probably find that the &lsquo;Daily Mail&rsquo; had added  his national insurance contribution to his salary, which would not be done with  any other individual. The &lsquo;Daily Mail&rsquo; does not exactly go by the lines, and,  perhaps more often than any other paper, sensationalises.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brolly</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat. Can I ask the Minister whether the increase from five  to 10 days for the chairman of Ilex was cleared by any Minister?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First Minister</strong>:  I would have to speak to ministerial colleagues to see whether that was the  case. As it is not the subject of the main question, it is hard for me to have  been briefed previously on the matter. However, I can give an undertaking that  we will attempt to establish the answer and let the Member know and perhaps put  it in the Library so that other colleagues will know as well.</p>
    <p class="H5StageHeading">Cross-sector Advisory Forum</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Ms J  McCann </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister if  the social economy sector will be represented on the cross-sector advisory  forum.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2715/09>(AQO 2715/09)</a></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: Using the accepted definition of a social economy organisation as  one that reinvests its surpluses in the organisation or community, I can  confirm that a number of such bodies are included in the membership of the  cross-sector advisory forum. A list of the full membership was attached to my  statement to the Assembly of 20 April. That included representation from NICVA,  the trade unions, the credit unions and a number of agencies established for  the public good. Since the first meeting of the cross-sector advisory forum, we  have been approached by a number of organisations, including those in the  social economy sector, offering support and seeking member&shy;ship of the forum. I  can see the value of having greater involvement, and the deputy First Minister  and I are considering whether that is best done through increasing the  membership of the forum or by allowing those groups to be part of the subgroups  that are under examination.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. Will the Minister outline his understanding of the role  played by the social economy sector in tackling poverty and disadvantage and in  promoting economic development and helping the economy?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First Minister</strong>:  I support the work of the third sector, as we call the social economy sector. I  recall going to the Bryson House recycling operation, although I cannot  remember whether I was Finance Minister or First Minister at the time. That  operation does not require funds from others; Bryson House can do the job  itself. Not only does that operation pay its way, but Bryson House now has  satellite businesses that employ many people who would otherwise be unemployed.  That is the type of operation that one wants to support, particularly at this  time.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The danger faced by a third sector is that, although it is  needed most at times of economic downturn, it has difficulties in getting  resources because of the requirement on it to get its funds beyond the public  sector. Therefore there is a conflict between its position and the needs of  society.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the third sector, and I want to hear from it. The  deputy First Minister and I have met representatives of the third sector at  sectoral meetings. It has a part to play, but we have to gauge whether that  would be best played at the plenary meetings or through the working groups.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Moutray</strong>:  Will the First Minister provide a brief account of the groups that are  represented on the cross-sector advisory forum?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: The cross-sector advisory forum is a representative body &mdash; I  almost said that its membership was like that of a civic forum. In fact, it  might be a good substitute for the Civic Forum. Its representatives will have  direct contact with the First Minister and the deputy First Minister, and it is  considerably cheaper than the Civic Forum.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The groups involved include not only the trade unions and  the farmers&rsquo; unions but representatives from voluntary and community groups,  professional organisations, energy companies, the energy regulator, our four  banks and business and construction industries. It is, therefore, a  representative body that covers all the areas in which there are concerns in  the current economy.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  How will staff be recruited to the cross-sector advisory forum? Will there be  an open and transparent recruitment process, or will it be a mere coalition of  the willing?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I am encouraged by the fact that a number of sectors want to be  involved in the forum, as it shows that the community wants to play a part in  getting us out of the present economic downturn. The staffing of the  cross-sector advisory forum will be done in OFMDFM at no additional cost. It is  not possible to have Members on the forum, but we have established the seven  sub-working groups that will deal with the seven areas of activity that I  outlined in my statement to the House some weeks ago. It is possible that the  Ministers who are dealing with those areas of responsibility will be in  membership, and we have invited each of the people on the forum to choose which  of those subgroups or how many of them they want to be on. There may be room  for other organisations to play a part in the sector that best relates to their  area of interest.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We do not want it to be a long-term body; it has been  established to deal with the current economic crisis. The question for oral  answer that was asked by Mrs Kelly the Member for Upper   Bann related to the fact that there is a body that, in normal  circumstances, can look at these business areas, and we do not want to take  away responsibilities from it. The cross-sector advisory forum is here for the  temporary emergency, and therefore I hope that its life will not be long.</p>

    <p class="H4StageHeading">Rural Childcare</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mrs Long </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development for an update on  the implementation of the findings of the rural childcare stakeholder group.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2731/09>(AQO 2731/09)</a></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development (Ms Gildernew)</strong>: Shortly after I took  office, I established the rural childcare stakeholder group, and I was pleased  to present its report &lsquo;Rural Childcare: Investing in the Future&rsquo; to the  ministerial subcommittee on children and young people last year. The report  contains a number of recommendations for my Department, as well as some  cross-cutting recommendations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As a working mother and a rural dweller, I know at first  hand how important it is to have access to affordable, accessible, good  childcare. I am keen to play my part so that more rural families have support  to allow them to consider taking up work or training opportunities. My  officials are finalising the details of a rural childcare programme, which is  anticipated to open for applications early this summer. That programme will be  funded from my Department&rsquo;s rural anti-poverty and social inclusion framework,  which will spend &pound;10 million addressing poverty and exclusion in rural areas.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My officials are working with other Departments on the  other recommendations for rural childcare as part of the development of the  rural champion concept and the rural White Paper. Work is ongoing to ensure  that the rural aspects of childcare are taken into account by, for example, the  Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister in its work on examining  childcare across the North, and the Department of Education in its early-years  strategy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will continue to advocate the needs of rural children, in  particular, through my membership of the ministerial subcommittee on children  and young people.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her comprehensive answer. I asked the question in the  context of matters arising from child poverty. Is the Minister considering  issues such as transport, which is one important factor that has been raised?  Moreover, has the issue of school-age childcare been resolved, and are any  discussions ongoing on that matter?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: There are five priority areas in our  rural anti-poverty and social inclusion framework, one of which is rural  transport. Access to good, affordable childcare in rural areas that helps  people to take up employment or training is a route out of poverty, and, as  such, it is very important that we provide childcare that reflects the specific  needs of rural dwellers. For example, people may have long distances to travel,  so childcare providers must open early and be flexible for parents who do shift  work, and so on. We need to ensure that rural dwellers have as equitable access  to services and opportunities as urban dwellers.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her response. She obviously recognises the importance  of childcare provision in the rural community. Does she feel that her  Department should ensure that there is parity of provision between rural and  urban areas?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: One reason that I initiated the rural  childcare stakeholder group is that it is clear that there is no parity of  provision for rural children. We must recognise that for a private childcare  provider, one important element in determining whether a business will be  successful is the critical mass that it has to draw upon. Therefore, what is  suitable in Camlough will not necessarily be suitable in Tullyreagh. We need to  ensure that the Government help, where possible. That is why we are rolling out  a number of pilot projects to try to address the need in rural areas that might  not otherwise work. We recognise the difficulty that exists and the  geographical area that a rural childcare provider must cover when trying to  make a business work.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burns</strong>:  Does the Minister agree that although several childcare strategy documents have  been published over the years, we have not seen enough improvement on the  ground, especially in rural communities?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I said at my first meeting with the  childcare group that we should not try to reinvent the wheel, but should look  at other childcare reports that had previously been commissioned, draw on those  experiences and try to keep our project time limited.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It was very clear that although there may be some  difficulty in accessing childcare in some urban areas, no specific study of  rural provision had been carried out. I felt that I, as Minister of Agriculture  and Rural Development, should use the opportunity to ensure that children and  parents in rural areas can access childcare and that they are not disadvantaged  in relation to their urban counterparts.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That was one of my first areas of work when I became  Minister, and it was an opportunity that I did not want to waste.</p>
    <p class="H5StageHeading">Farm Modernisation Scheme</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Dr W  McCrea </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development when farmers  will be told if they have been successful with their applications for the farm  modernisation scheme.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2732/09>(AQO 2732/09)</a></p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">17. <strong>Mr D  Ford </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development for an update  on the farm modernisation scheme.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2747/09>(AQO  2747/09)</a></p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">18. <strong>Mrs M  O&rsquo;Neill </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development to outline  progress on the farm modernisation scheme; and when letters of offer will be  issued.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2748/09>(AQO 2748/09)</a></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: With your permission, a LeasCheann Comhairle,  I will answer questions 2, 17 and 18 together.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">After initial concerns were expressed by the European  Commission about the basis for the allocation of funding to applicants under  the farm modernisation programme, the Commission confirmed that it is not for  it to determine, at this stage, whether the selection criteria have been  established in conformity with European legislation and further confirmed that  it will proceed to release funding for the programme. Therefore, I confirmed on  2 April that the first tranche of the programme will proceed along the lines  originally planned.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Applications are being assessed by the managing agent for  the programme, and I am pleased that the process of issuing letters of offer to  successful applicants, and giving notification to unsuccessful applicants, has  commenced. I expect approximately 1,100 successful applicants for the &pound;6  million funding that is available under the first tranche of the scheme.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr W McCrea</strong>:  I am sure that the Minister accepts that farmers need certainty on this issue,  especially in light of the recent press coverage. She has said that letters  have started to go out to the farmers. Will any farmer who posted an  application form for the farm modernisation scheme receive funding from the first  tranche of money?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: A number of applicants will have posted  their applications. Until each application has been assessed, we cannot  determine the exact number of postal applications that will be funded. However,  by way of illustration, for every 1,000 applicants funded, 268 will be postal,  which means that about one quarter of the applications, or 26&middot;83%, will have  been received by post.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  have no desire to rehash the issue of the first tranche of funding from the  farm management scheme. However, given the difficulties that arose from that  scheme, and the issue of ongoing European funding, will the Minister give some  reassurance to those who have lost out in the first tranche that there will be  an early second tranche, and that they will have a meaningful opportunity to  reapply?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: We had always intended to open the  second tranche no earlier than next year. The second tranche will not be open  for the next 12 months. We want to learn lessons from the initial tranche and  to ensure that we have a more robust mechanism, which people will be happy  with. I was upfront in my request to my partners to help us to find a way to  deliver on that, and the same situation applies. I look forward to hearing the  views of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development on how we should  proceed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Farmers know that if we can fund only around 1,100  applicants out of the first tranche, many more will be disappointed than will  be happy, because we had more than 9,000 applications. Our economy has been  given a great boost by the fact that so many farmers are willing to invest a  lot of their own money to modernise their farm businesses.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>:  The Minister is far too young to remember the long dole queues of the 1950s.  However, does she agree that that was no way to treat framers, and that they  would have been much better off back on the farm, milking Daisy? Will she  assure Members that farmers will never again be asked to stand in queues,  clutching application forms, for money that is rightly theirs?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I have been very open. I did not want  farmers to have to queue to submit their application forms. It was perceived  that farmers were queuing up for a handout, which was not the case. If every  farmer had arrived on the same morning and formed a queue, they would all have  been dealt with by lunchtime. All 9,000 applications were processed in a  morning, with very little difficulty. It is commendable that staff in the DARD  Direct offices were able to process those applications and that it was done  with little fuss and great good humour across all nine offices. However,  lessons have been learned from the first tranche.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not remember the dole queues of the 1950s, but farmers  were not queuing up for money under the farm modernisation scheme. They were  submitting application forms, and the selection criteria had already been  established. There was some disingenuous reporting of the process.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>:  Have the EU authorities given any assurance that there will be no financial  recall due to the selection criteria?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: It is not helpful to speculate about  disallowance. There is the possibility that any scheme could be subject to an  EU audit at some time, and, therefore, there is always a risk of disallowance.  However, we can offer a strong argument that we have met all the EU legislative  requirements and that we have taken a belt-and-braces approach since 17  February. Stringent measures have been taken to ensure that no auditor could  find fault with the process. We wanted to be in a position to issue letters of  offer as early as possible and to let farmers know whether they had been successful  in the first tranche.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question 3 has been withdrawn.</p>
    <p class="H5StageHeading">DARD Appeals</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mr  Elliott </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development if there  are any plans to review the appeals system available to farmers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2734/09>(AQO 2734/09)</a></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: The issue of DARD&rsquo;s appeal process has  been raised before, both in the Chamber and at the Committee. Due to the  concerns that were raised earlier this year, I commissioned my Department to  initiate a review of its review processes. A scoping study is being completed,  and I hope to have the results of that exercise soon.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have always advocated that farmers and rural dwellers  have a right to seek a review of my Department&rsquo;s decisions. I want to ensure  that the outcome of the review will provide farmers and rural dwellers with  access to an appeals system that is fair, objective, transparent and  independent. That will ensure that the review process has delivered our  obligations under both EU and domestic legislation.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I thank the Minister for those comments, and I appreciate the review that is  ongoing. Does the Minister agree &mdash; indeed, does her reply indicate &mdash; that the  current system is not fair, objective or independent?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Given the House&rsquo;s level of concern about  the matter, I thought that it was incumbent on me to bring forward a review to  assess whether there is anything that we can do to make the process more  favourable for farmers. The Member would expect me to do that in my position.  We will look at the process and ensure that it is the best that it can be for  farmers and rural dwellers.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Would the Minister care to comment on Lord Justice Weatherup&rsquo;s review of a  number of appeals? Lord Justice Weatherup has overturned an individual case,  which could affect the other 1,100 farmers who had been disallowed. Will she  say clearly that those 1,100 farmers will not have to go through an arduous  process and that they will get the money that is rightly theirs, as defined by  this country&rsquo;s court of law?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: The Member will know that the  applications were dismissed in two of the four cases that were referred for  judicial review. Therefore, penalties will not be refunded in those two cases.  I can confirm that the two cases that Justice Weatherup referred back to the  external panel have been finalised and that the farm businesses involved have  been excused of their penalties.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although that satisfies the requirements of the judgement,  my officials have been actively engaged with legal advisers to consider the  outworking of the judgement. Those discussions have taken longer than expected,  but I understand that proposals on the options for the handling of other duplicate-field  cases are being prepared and should be with me shortly. The proposals will need  to be discussed with industry representatives and the Agriculture Committee  before any final decision can be made.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her answers so far. I find it difficult to accept that  the Minister overruled the appellants&rsquo; cases, and the independent panel&rsquo;s  support for farming, in favour of the establishment. The Minister obviously  should have some understanding of what that loss of finance will mean for  farms. Does she not agree that her failure to accept the panel&rsquo;s decision is a  snub to its members and their ability to sit in judgement on appeals? How many  times has the Minister overruled the panel&rsquo;s rejection of appeals?</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: The Member knows that there is a  statutory basis for the review of the decisions that have been through the  appeals process. The outcome of any appeals system is to ensure that the right  decisions are made. Until the review of the current processes is complete, I am  in no position to determine whether any appeals decision under a revised  process will be binding on the Department. The appeals panel exists to do a  job. I am not able to overturn its decisions; I can only ensure that the proper  procedures are carried out. There is a lack of understanding of my role in the  process.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question 5 has been withdrawn.</p>
    <p class="H5StageHeading">Flooding: Contingency Plans</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">6. <strong>Ms N&iacute;  Chuil&iacute;n </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, in  relation to the flooding events last summer, (i) what contingency plans the  Rivers Agency has in place; and (ii) to detail the lessons learned.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2736/09>(AQO 2736/09)</a></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Having witnessed the extent of the flooding  at first hand, I am well aware of the impact that the extreme flooding event of  last August has had on people&rsquo;s lives and property. Climate change is likely to  make such extreme events more common. It is important for the Government to  collectively provide a co-ordinated response to minimise the impact of such  events on society. Although the response to the flooding of August 2008 gave  clear evidence of a collective response by the Government, nevertheless,  lessons can be learned.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Rivers Agency, which is an executive agency in my  Department, has an important role to play in flood-emergency planning, and it  has a well-structured process that is co-ordinated with Roads Service, Northern  Ireland Water and other responders. The agency&rsquo;s suite of emergency plans is  tested and debriefed regularly. Debriefing following events such as the August  flooding are fed into the emergency planning process.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Last August, early co-ordination in anticipation of  flooding, along with the response itself, undoubtedly prevented damage at many  locations. Nevertheless, the agency has identified lessons to be learned and is  taking action on them. Those include the Rivers Agency&rsquo;s recently introduced  flooding incident line that provides a single point of contact for people seeking  assistance. The Rivers Agency has offered to supply sandbags to each of the 26  district councils, to be stored close to areas known to be at risk from  flooding.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Promoting awareness is also vital to the management of  flood risk, and the launch of the strategic flood map in November 2008 enables  householders and businesses to find out more about the areas prone to flooding  and to take appropriate action.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  The Minister has outlined in detail what has happened since last year. Will she  advise the House about the actions that the Rivers Agency has taken to prevent  similar occurrences to those we witnessed during last year&rsquo;s flooding? Go raibh  maith agat.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: In the aftermath of the flooding of August  2008, the Rivers Agency undertook extensive maintenance and repair works to  restore the operation of the drainage network in the areas affected adversely.  Initial investigations into the flooding were also undertaken, and they  indicated that 900 properties at numerous locations were affected by flooding  from rivers. Where a solution is considered viable, further detailed  investigations are being commissioned and additional funding is being sought  for new projects to be included in the Rivers Agency&rsquo;s major works programme.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  I am appalled by some of the things that I am hearing about the reviews and  what is taking place. It came as no surprise to me, when the Rivers Agency made  a presentation to the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development, that it  inspects some rivers only every two to three years. Debris is still lying in  and beside the Six Mile Water where properties were flooded. The Rivers Agency  has not cleared that debris. What will the Minister do in relation to it?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: In many cases, the responsibility for  keeping watercourses clear is that of the riparian landowner. There should be  no confusion about that. However, the Rivers Agency has worked on issues and  has taken action in the past because it believes that the actions of others may  lead to a flooding incident and that preventative action is needed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member is welcome to write to me and I will respond on  the specific case of the Six Mile Water. We want to work with elected representatives  and the public to try to prevent incidents of flooding. However, the resources  of the Rivers Agency are finite and it has planned major works. The agency  cannot be responsible for maintaining rivers outside its responsibility and it  has no budget for keeping watercourses clear.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We must be clear as to whose job it is to keep certain  rivers clear. We will not be found wanting when it comes to meeting the  Government&rsquo;s responsibilities, but landowners have to meet their  responsibilities. I ask that they work with us to keep watercourses free from  debris and to ensure that actions are not being taken that could lead to a  flooding event during the next heavy rainfall.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Will the Minister give a specific update on the measures being taken to prevent  the River Halfpenny from flooding neighbouring homes in the Knockramer Meadows  area of Lurgan as it did last year?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I do not have that information with me.  The Member has corresponded with me about that issue and I am happy to provide  her with an update in writing.</p>
    <p class="H5StageHeading">Rural Tourism</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">7. <strong>Mr  Neeson </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development what  discussions she has had with the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment about  promoting tourism in the countryside.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2737/09>(AQO  2737/09)</a></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I have accompanied the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment to the North/South Ministerial Council in tourism sectoral format on  three occasions. At those meetings, we agreed with our counterparts in the  South a number of actions to promote tourism on the island of Ireland  and not just in Fermanagh. Obviously, one would expect me to get plenty of  spake in about the potential for rural tourism and what it can do for the  economy in rural areas.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, my officials have maintained ongoing contact  with the Department of Enterprise, Trade adn Investment (DETI), Invest NI and  the NITB (Northern Ireland Tourist Board) throughout the implementation phase  of the programme. It was through those contacts that my officials were able to  agree with DETI and the NITB that up to four self-catering units could be  funded providing that planning permission were in place before an application  was submitted. That was important to the programme. Farmers are very interested  in developing self-catering units as potential farm diversification projects.  It is a good example of how closely officials have been working together, and I  thank all those involved.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Originally, there had to be a minimum of four units;  however, we have identified that it is OK to proceed with up to four units.  Again, I emphasise that it is vitally important that Departments and agencies  work together to ensure that synergies are developed between the various programmes  so that we maximise the effect that funding has in rural areas.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Officials from the Department of Agriculture and Rural  Development (DARD) and other Departments and agencies have met representatives  of the joint council committees to discuss the tourism elements of their  strategies. Recently, DARD appointed a senior official to sit on the DETI  steering group that is considering the development of a new tourism strategy  for the North.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her response. Given the current exchange rate, will the  Minister and her Department encourage even more rural tourism in Northern Ireland?  Will she also encourage the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and Tourism Ireland to promote rural tourism in Northern Ireland  even more?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I was doing that long before I became  the Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some beautiful parts of the country are being vastly  under-exploited when it comes to tourism. We are funding tourism measures  through the rural development programme, and I am keen to hear from council  clusters about any difficulties they are having in getting match funding. I  want to be able to help to free up the money that is needed to match some of  those projects.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I believe that rural tourism is vastly under-exploited and  that a huge number of opportunities exist. We should encourage people to get  out, enjoy and appreciate the beauty of the scenery that we have to offer.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I Mc Crea</strong>:  The Minister is aware that I have raised the issue of the benefits of mountain  biking for tourism in Northern    Ireland. I know that her Department is in  discussions with Cookstown District Council about Davagh  Forest; however, will the Minister  detail what other ongoing discussions her Department has held to promote  mountain biking in Northern    Ireland and its tourism potential?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: As the Member knows, our forests have  great potential to support the tourism agenda. My officials have been exploring  that area of opportunity. We have held discussions with councils and the Forest  Service, which has been a major partner in developing mountain-bike trails in Cam Forest.  Those discussions were especially relevant to the forests within the signature  project areas that the Tourist Board has identified.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Forest Service officials have been involved in discussions  with the Tourist Board and other stake&shy;holders about the contribution that  forests can make and how that can best be delivered. We are forming  partnerships with other interested providers, such as councils, to better  realise the opportunities available. I will ensure that that work continues,  and I am happy to keep the Member informed as things develop.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that some exciting projects can be found for  mountain biking in forests.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McClarty</strong>:  The Minister will be well aware of the huge difficulties in obtaining planning  permission for rural tourism developments. Will the Minister detail what  actions she has taken, with the Minister of the Environment, to address that?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: The Member is correct; as a constituency  MP, I am aware of the difficulties in obtaining planning permission in time to  spend the funding that has been allocated within the parameters. That has come  up in discussions between the Minister of the Environment and me. I shall  continue to press on the need to front-load applications that come from  Government funding to ensure that money at the end of project is not wasted  because of a difficulty such as planning permission.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for her  answer. Will she outline how tourism is encouraged at Carlingford Lough and  Lough Foyle? Go raibh maith agat.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: The Loughs Agency has a statutory  responsibility for the development of marine tourism and the promotion of the  development of Lough Foyle and Carlingford Lough for commercial and  recreational purposes. I understand that the agency is about to receive a  letter of offer for &euro;4 million of INTERREG funding under its tourism measure.  The industry will promote a number of key themes, including boating access and  infrastructure, angling infrastructure, visitor facilities such as drying  rooms, and effective marketing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Loughs Agency has also implemented the sustainable  development fund to assist tourism development in 2008-09. It had a budget of  &pound;100,000 in each year and provided funding to two broad themes: the development  of angling and of marine tourism. Many good things are happening at Lough Foyle  and Carlingford Lough, and I hope that that is an added benefit to rural  tourism projects.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question 8 has been withdrawn, and Mr McElduff is not in his place  to ask question 9.</p>
    <p class="H5StageHeading" style="margin-bottom:5.65pt;">Food Supply</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">10. <strong>Ms  Anderson </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development what her  Department has done to improve the supply chain in the production of food.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2740/09>(AQO 2740/09)</a></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Develop&shy;ment</strong>: There is no doubt about the need to  support our agrifood industry to improve and develop the supply chain, and the  need for increased producer knowledge and involvement in the food supply chain  was highlighted in the industry&rsquo;s vision report of 2001. In response to that,  my Department initiated the supply-chain awareness programme for farmers to  improve knowledge of their respective supply chains. That included learning  work&shy;shops and a series of visits to examine supply chains here and in other  countries. Between 2003 and 2007, over 1,300 producers participated in that  programme.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A further programme was put together to support farmers who  wished to take the next step and become more active in building a new supply  chain. Under the Fit for Market initiative, we piloted the supply-chain  development programme with six groups of farmers. That demonstrated the  benefits of the programme, and it has now been adopted into axis 1 of the rural  development programme to be available to more farmers. In turn, that interfaces  with the processing and marketing grant scheme, and the marketing and  development grant scheme, to support market-led initiatives through financial  support, capital costs and non-capital expenditure.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My Department is also working with farmers and processors  to increase their capability to improve and strengthen their supply chains. We  are supporting a three-year project with the University of Ulster  to analyse the vast amount of market data that is available from the Tesco  Clubcard database. My answer is quite long, so I will take a supplementary  question.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. I thank the Minister for that answer. Does her Department  prevent duplicating the support that is available to the industry through  Invest NI? If so, how does it do that?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: All the support for the improvement of supply  chains has been carried out with the co-operation and involvement of Invest NI,  and much of it was co-ordinated through interdepartmental working groups that  were set up to implement the recommendations of the Fit for Market study. That  is monitored by the Food Strategy Implementation Partnership. After the completion  of that partnership&rsquo;s work, new arrangements have been put in place between  DARD and DETI to co-ordinate support to the agrifood industry.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">An industry advisory panel, an interdepartmental working  group and five interdepartmental project teams, including a supply-chain team,  have been set up to facilitate formal arrangements by which DARD and Invest NI  would work together for the good of the local agrifood industry.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Those teams will continue to develop and deliver work that  is instigated under the Fit for Market initiative.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="8"></a>Culture, Arts and Leisure</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">North/South Bodies</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. Dr W McCrea asked Minister of Culture, Arts and  Leisure what assessment he has made of the effect of the Budget announced by  the Government of the Republic   of Ireland on the  language and waterways North/South bodies.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2751/09>(AQO  2751/09)</a></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure (Mr Campbell)</strong>: The implications of the  supplementary Budget that was published in the Irish Republic  in April 2009 on the North/South Language Body and Waterways Ireland are  currently being considered by the Department of Finance and Personnel and by  officials in my Department. The figures that have been published in the Irish  Republic show that there has been a 10% reduction in funding for the  North/South Language Body, which amounts to &euro;1&middot;84 million, and a 4% reduction  in funding for Waterways Ireland, which amounts to &euro;1&middot;64 million, when compared  against the 2008 out-turn figures.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As almost 94% of the North/South Language Body&rsquo;s funding in  the Republic is directed towards Foras na Gaeilge, it appears to be suffering  the major impact. However, budgets have not been agreed and, from my  perspective, the priorities will be to deliver efficiencies from North/South  bodies and to further reduce the funding disparity between Irish and Ulster  Scots. Additionally, if current funding ratios are to be maintained, Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  financial contribution to North/South bodies may need to be adjusted  accordingly.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr W McCrea</strong>:  Before I ask my supplementary question, I am sure that the Minister will join  me in offering the family of Mark Young from Cookstown, who died after an  incident at the North West 200, our deepest sympathy, while also praying  earnestly that John Anderton from Antrim will make a speedy recovery and that  his family will have comfort as they sit at his bedside during this difficult time.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">What funding implications will the proposed cuts have for  the two agencies of the North/South Language Body?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: Of course, our thoughts and prayers are with the  families who were affected by the incidents that took place at the North West 200. We hope  that the injured biker will recover. We think of the relatives of the young  biker who, sadly, on the first occasion of his taking part in the North West 200 lost his  life.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Any revised amounts that are allocated to the two agencies  must be agreed by the sponsor and the Finance Departments in Northern Ireland and the Republic.  They must then be approved by Ministers at the North/South Ministerial  Council&rsquo;s language sectoral meeting. Initial indications from the proposals  that are currently under consideration are that the reduction in the  Ulster-Scots Agency&rsquo;s budget will be in the region of 3% of its proposed budget  figure. That equates to approximately &pound;100,000. Initial indications for Foras  na Gaeilge&rsquo;s budget, which is funded predominantly by my counterpart in the Republic of Ireland, are that it could face a  reduction in funding of between 8% and 9%. That equates to a reduction of in  the region of &euro;1&middot;89 million against the draft budget.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Since I came to office, one of my objectives has been to  eliminate the disparity in funding for Irish and Ulster Scots, just as it was  for my predecessor. It is unfortunate that this is the route that may have to  be pursued, but, nonetheless, the Republic has had to cut its cloth accordingly.  That is a matter for its Government, who have made that decision. Northern Ireland  must make a corresponding reduction. Therefore, the gap will narrow, although  not in the way that we had anticipated.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Ba mhaith liom mo bhu&iacute;ochas a  ghabh&aacute;il leis an Aire as an fhreagra sin.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Chairperson of the Committee for Culture, Arts and  Leisure, I want to be associated with William McCrea&rsquo;s comments and extend my  sympathy to the family of Mark Young.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister provide assurance that any efficiency  savings that are made will not impact on the operational effectiveness of  Waterways Ireland or, indeed, the all-Ireland language body, An Foras Teanga,  given the importance of their work?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I can certainly assure the Member that my  objective is to ensure that taxpayers in Northern Ireland, in particular,  get value for money. We want to ensure that the incorporated savings do not  impact on the front line service that the various bodies provide. However, we  are in a different financial regime from the one that we were in 12 months ago,  or two or three years ago, and we may have to curtail expenditure. We will do  so in the appropriate way and minimise direct services to consumers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As usual, the Member used language such as &ldquo;all-Ireland  bodies&rdquo;. I am not sure what that means. If he means bodies that are made up  from bodies from this country and from the Irish Republic,  I know exactly what he means, even if he has misappropriated the language.  However, we intend to ensure that people receive value for money.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  Has the Minister assessed the financial cuts that are likely to be imposed on  his Department after the Chancellor&rsquo;s announcement of &pound;14 billion of efficiency  savings for the period after 2011? Has he discussed that issue with the  Minister of Finance and Personnel and the rest of the Executive?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: Discussions are ongoing on the implications of  that announcement for a range of Departments, not only for the Department of  Culture, Arts and Leisure. We will discuss the issue with the Department of  Finance and Personnel and have wider discussions with the Chancellor to  minimise implications for people in Northern Ireland and to maintain  the position in so far as it is possible.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  The Minister&rsquo;s remarks are somewhat churlish. The Government in the other part  of Ireland  have given millions of pounds to the North and provided up to 85% of the  funding for Waterways Ireland. I was waiting for the Minister to do a jig of  delight at how the Southern economy is suffering and how the North will bear  the financial consequences. Will he reassure the House that, in his  conversations with the Irish Government, he will be mindful of their economic  conditions and will leave no stone unturned to maximise the Irish Government&rsquo;s  funding of Foras na Gaeilge, the Ulster-Scots Language Agency and Waterways  Ireland? Will he punch his weight during those negotiations?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: The honourable Member is attempting to overreach  himself. I must ensure that the delivery of the Department&rsquo;s functions, through  arm&rsquo;s-length bodies and so on, ensures that value for money is accrued. I  intend to secure value for money for the Ulster-Scots Language Agency and  through our contribution to Foras na Gaeilge.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The honourable Member says that I am being churlish. I am  not being churlish at all; I am merely reporting the factual position given to  me by my counterpart in the Irish   Republic. The Irish  Government report that they have had to cut their cloth accordingly and reduce  significantly the amount of money that they put into the North/South Language  Body. We will have to do likewise. It is a case not of churlishness but of facing  reality. We will do what we can to protect services and, as far as possible, to  deliver the programmes that we have outlined. However, we must face that  reality and not run away from it.</p>
    <p class="H5StageHeading">Sports Grounds: Safety</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr Burns </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure to outline his Department&rsquo;s  proposals for ensuring that spectator safety at sports grounds is not  compromised.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2752/09>(AQO 2752/09)</a></p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">6. Mrs Long asked the Minister of Culture, Arts  and Leisure what action his Department is taking to increase safety at sports  stadiums.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO2756/09> (AQO 2756/09)</a></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: With your permission, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will  answer questions 2 and 6 together.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the first instance, responsibility for increasing safety  at sports grounds and ensuring that it is not compromised rests with the owners  and operators of those venues. However, the Department of Culture, Arts and  Leisure is currently taking forward a safety at sports grounds initiative. The  aim of that is to encourage and assist owners and operators of major sports  facilities to improve spectator safety at their grounds. As part of that  initiative, the Department has introduced and is currently implementing new  legislation on safety at sports grounds; that is, The Safety of Sports Grounds  (Northern Ireland)  Order 2006.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, Sport Northern Ireland, which is responsible  for the development of sport, including the distribution of funding, has been  running funding programmes designed to assist owners and operators of venues to  improve spectator safety at their venues. Those include a stadia safety  programme and, previously, an interim safe sports ground scheme.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, I am in ongoing correspondence with Paul  Goggins MP, Minister with responsibility for criminal justice in the NIO, about  the introduction of complementary public order legislation to help combat  spectator behaviour problems where they arise. DCAL officials have assisted the  NIO with the development of draft proposals for legislation, and I have since  written to Minister Goggins asking him to publish those for consultation as  soon as is practicable. I understand from the NIO that a response will be  provided shortly.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burns</strong>:  Can the Minister tell us how much money is available to upgrade facilities at  sports grounds? Does he not agree that the GAA county grounds, the Irish league  football grounds and rugby grounds such as Ravenhill need a massive injection  of cash immediately to get them up to the necessary standard?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I can tell the Member that, in the past eight  and a half years, Sport Northern Ireland has made available approximately &pound;12&middot;5  million since August 2000 to help clubs develop proposals and implement safety  improvements at their grounds. There are a number of schemes in place, and I  know of a range of applications that are currently being processed that will  complement that total. It is work in progress that needs to continue, and I  certainly intend to ensure that, in so far as we can, we will develop grounds  in which spectators can watch sport in safety and those participating can do so  in safety.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his answer. Does the Minister have any concept of the  shortfall between the funding that is available and the amount of money that is  needed to bring the grounds up to the required safety levels? Furthermore, can  he give us a time frame or any indication of when we are likely to see some  progress on the issue of the Football (Offences) Act 1991?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I do not have figures for the shortfall between  what is available and what is required, because a number of stadia can be  assisted by offering provision merely to eliminate relatively minor safety  problems, whereas other grounds may have more major problems. The obvious  example is Windsor   Park, where there are  safety considerations involving some aspects of the ground that are more  significant than others. Work on what needs to be done is ongoing. I cannot  provide the Member with a time frame, but I will obtain that and write to her,  so that she can get a clear picture of when that is likely to be achieved.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  Will the Minister indicate what proportion of his Department&rsquo;s overall  safety-linked expenditure on football goes towards major league clubs and what  proportion goes to local and community-based football teams? While I am on my  feet, will he join me in congratulating Glentoran Football Club on lifting the  Gibson Cup? I am sure that he trusts that Glasgow Rangers can emulate that  achievement.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: In relation to the latter part of the Member&rsquo;s  question, I know that he is a long-standing Glentoran supporter, but he will  understand that, as sports Minister, I must remain neutral.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Moving swiftly on, he has asked me to outline the breakdown  of expenditure on major league grounds and how that compares with the smaller  teams. I know that Sport Northern Ireland recently provided funding to  Ballymena United, Cliftonville, Portadown and Donegal Celtic and to Gaelic  football grounds in Armagh, Down, Fermanagh,  Tyrone and Antrim. The smaller grounds do not require such significant  investments in safety, but Sport NI will be able to provide the Member with a  comprehensive list that he can peruse at his leisure.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his comprehensive response about safety at sports  grounds. Many of us have concerns about that issue, but does the Minister know  whether there have been any major incidents or injuries at football grounds in  the past few years?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I thank the Member for his question, which is  pertinent in the context of some headlines that followed previous questions for  oral answer. Unfortunately, discussions about spectator safety can cover  anything from a faulty turnstile or light bulb to major problems with stands in  which a significant number of people may be at risk. Some people in the media  concentrate only on the major issues, for understandable reasons. I am not  aware of any safety considerations at football grounds that have led to major  accidents in recent years. However, that is not a cause for over-optimism in  future. There are grounds in need of upgrading that have received money and  will continue to receive money. We must ensure that maximum spectator safety is  delivered and that participants play at grounds that have safety provisions  built in.</p>
    <p class="H5StageHeading">Library Services</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. Mr Dallat asked the Minister of Culture, Arts  and Leisure how his Department intends to ensure that there are high-quality  long-term working relationships with the Department of Education with regard to  the provision of library services.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2753/09>(AQO  2753/09)</a></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: My Department has had a close working relationship  with the Department of Education throughout the process of creating the new Northern Ireland  library authority, which will now be known as Libraries NI. Those arrangements  will continue into the future with the education and library boards and then  the education and skills authority. Libraries NI is developing strategic  partnerships with a number of organisations, and close working arrangements  will continue for the delivery of the public and schools library service.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My officials are also working closely with the Education  and Training Inspectorate on a learning strategy with the aim of developing  innovative ways of supporting schools&rsquo; delivery of the revised curriculum.  Public libraries will continue to work with schools and school-age children through  classroom visits, homework clubs and reading groups, to list just a few of the  many services that are provided by public libraries.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>: I  strongly welcome the Minister&rsquo;s reply. Does he agree with me that, considering  the very high levels of illiteracy and innumeracy in Northern Ireland and particularly  the 250,000 people between the ages of 16 and 64 who have been failed by the  education system, there must be the closest co-operation between the library  service and the Department of Education? Furthermore, will he ensure that that  service is available in all the towns and villages of Northern Ireland?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: The short answer is yes. Unfortunately, the  library service is somewhat of a Cinderella service, and it is much overlooked.  I highly recommend that honourable Members and the wider public visit their  local library, because the traditional concept of a library has changed  dramatically in the past five or six years. I know that change is on the agenda  for the next few years as well. I concur fully with the honourable Member&rsquo;s  remarks. There must be close co-operation between the new libraries authority  and the schools. In addition, the &ldquo;silver surfer&rdquo; phenomenon has become a  significant feature in libraries. Senior citizens are using libraries to obtain  information and to pass their leisure time. Libraries have undergone  significant developments for the benefit of all age groups, and I recommend  that people use them. It is to be hoped that the progress that has been made  will continue in the future.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Will the Minister provide details of  the smooth operation or otherwise of the voluntary redundancy scheme that was  part of the formation of the library authority?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: My understanding is that progress is being made  on the transfer and on those who are facing redundancy. Obviously, salary payments  must be adapted for those who are moving from their previous employer to  continue working for the new employer. I understand that there are no  significant outstanding difficulties and that the transition is reasonably  smooth.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  What meetings has the Minister had with the Department of Education on the  setting up of Libraries NI?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: In the financial year that has just ended,  Libraries NI met the permanent secretary of DCAL and Department of Education  officials to address all outstanding issues. Subsequent to that series of  initial meetings, a further series of meetings took place between my Department  and the Department of Education on a range of transfer matters. Of course, in  the coming months, such meetings will continue until the process has been  completed.</p>
    <p class="H5StageHeading">Football Grounds</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mr Ross </strong>asked  the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure what his Department and its  associated bodies have done to support stadia improvements for football clubs  in the past financial year and if there are plans to support improvements in  this financial year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2754/09>(AQO 2754/09)</a></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: The responsibility for stadia improvements at  football clubs rests, in the first instance, with the owners of the venues.  However, Sport NI, which is responsible for the development of sport, including  the distribution of funding, has been running a number of programmes to which  owners of football stadia are eligible to apply. Those include the stadia  safety programme and the soccer strategy playing facilities programme.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the past financial year, Sport NI has paid out more than  &pound;1&middot;3 million from those programmes to, among others, Ballymena United Football  Club, Cliftonville Football Club, Donegal Celtic Football Club and Portadown  Football Club to assist with improvements to their stadia. For the current CSR  period, DCAL has allocated &pound;8&middot;418 million for stadia safety. In this financial  year, Sport NI is considering awarding &pound;5&middot;45 million, of which &pound;3&middot;85 million will  be aimed at football stadia. Of course, that is subject to economic appraisals,  statutory processes and the necessary approvals.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, the Irish Football Association has launched a  soccer strategy playing facilities programme to assist Irish league clubs to  meet UEFA licensing and IFA Premiership and IFA Intermediate League facility  requirements. Under that programme, Sport NI has issued provisional letters of  offer totalling &pound;3&middot;47 million to 23 football clubs.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I  thank the Minister for that compre&shy;hensive response. When might the money that  could be released this year be available to football clubs?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I am glad that the Member asked about the  precise timing, because DCAL and Sport NI are considering five business cases  that football clubs have submitted under the stadia safety programme. Subject  to the completion of the necessary accountability and approval processes, I  expect approval to be given to a number of those clubs in time for the  beginning of the new football season. Institute Football Club and Ballymena  United Football Club are two of the clubs that are at the forefront of the  approval process.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Browne</strong>:  Will the Minister confirm that the necessary health and safety measures will be  implemented at Windsor   Park to ensure that  international football is played there for the foreseeable future? I also take  this opportunity to congratulate the other two Belfast clubs that lifted trophies recently;  namely, Crusaders Football Club and Harland and Wolff Welders Football Club.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I sense that there will be a round of  congratulations to all clubs as we come towards the end of the football season.  There are a few other trophies yet to be won, not just in Northern Ireland. We shall see what  the next week or so brings forth.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member rightly raises the issue of Windsor Park.  It is imperative that we maintain and retain international football in Northern Ireland for the Northern Ireland team. Someone told  me that, since I came to office, Northern Ireland has been unbeaten  in competitive games. That is good. I wish we could finish the rest of the  qualifying campaign in the next couple of months, because then we could get  through to the World Cup finals without any difficulty.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We need to ensure that Windsor Park is kept up to the  necessary standard and that international football continues to be played  there, so that we do not find ourselves in the position that we were in a few  years ago, whereby Northern Ireland had to play its home games in either  England or Scotland.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question 5 has been withdrawn, and Question 6 has been grouped.</p>
    <p class="H5StageHeading">Sports Funding</p>
    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">7. <strong>Mr  McCartney </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure what plans his  Department has to lobby the NIO to ensure that monies acquired from criminal  assets recovery will be reinvested in sport.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2757/09>(AQO  2757/09)</a></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: Issues pertinent to assets recovery and the  redistribution of cash forfeiture receipts are a reserved matter and the  responsibility of the Home Office in conjunction with the Secretary of State  for Northern Ireland.  I am aware, however, that recovered assets from both civil and criminal cases  are returned to the Home Office, which retains half and returns the remaining  half of the amount raised, net of costs, to the agency or agencies responsible  for the recovery. That is known as incentivisation. Where a portion of the  incentivisation funds are directed towards the community, it is clear that  those funds are to be used to fund local crime-fighting priorities for the  benefit of that community.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as a  fhreagra. In thanking the Minister for his answer, I wonder if he has had any  contact with his counterpart in Scotland,  the Minister for Public Health and Sport, who has an excellent scheme that uses  all assets recovered from criminals to pour back into health projects. Does the  Minister have any such plans for the future?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I am aware of the Scottish scheme, and I will  want to ensure that whatever is available elsewhere is no more generous than  would be available in Northern    Ireland. I have not had any discussions with  the Minister for Public Health and Sport as this is a relatively new funding  scheme, and I am told by the NIO that it is at a very early stage. I am happy  to have such discussions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">All of us, whether Members, Ministers or members of the  public, should do whatever we can to ensure that those who are engaged in crime  cease to engage in it. We must do whatever we can to ensure that young people  do not get involved in crime in the first place. If we can channel funds into  providing opportunities, particularly sporting opportunities, to ensure that  young people do not get involved in criminal activities, we should do so.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  I note that the Member for Foyle who asked the previous question, who might  know someone who might know some more, is not offering cash back from the  proceeds of the Northern Bank robbery. It would substantially add to the  criminal asset recovery funds if he or some of his friends were to come forward.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member keep to his question?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  I am sorry if that upset you, Deputy Speaker. I will follow your instructions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister alluded to the CashBack for Communities  programme in Scotland,  which has benefited 38,000 young people and invested &pound;11 million. Those behind  the scheme negotiated for that money. Does the Minister agree that it would be  worthwhile to attempt to negotiate a sum from the Northern Ireland Office for a  similar scheme in Northern    Ireland?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I thank the Member and empathise with his views  on all that we have to do and should keep doing to ensure that benefit is  accrued, particularly but not exclusively for young people. We should do all we  can to ensure that they do not get involved with paramilitary groups; and there  are those who have some prior knowledge of that type of activity in a past  life. Now that we have moved away from that and people have decided that that  is not the route for them, we ought to ensure that no future generation does  likewise.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said in my previous answer, I want to ensure that the Northern Ireland scheme is no less generous than  the scheme in Scotland  or any other similar scheme. At present, it is a reserved matter, but I am  happy to have the discussions that will be required to ensure that, in helping  people to stay away from crime, we get the best possible bang for our buck.</p>

    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. In relation to Mr McNarry&rsquo;s lead-in to  his question, were his comments about another Member appropriate? I ask the  Speaker to check the record and return with a ruling. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Mr Speaker will look at the Hansard report and will reply.</p>

    <p class="H4StageHeading">Restructuring of the Executive and Assembly</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Debate resumed on amendment to motion:</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly supports, in principle, the restructuring  of the Northern Ireland Executive and the Assembly in order to improve the  efficiency and effectiveness of government; and calls on the First Minister and  deputy First Minister to update the Assembly on the proposals for the creation  of an Efficiency Review Panel, as announced on 9 April 2009, and to agree to  implement a review and produce a report on the issue of the number of MLAs and  government Departments in the next Assembly, within the next six months. &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Mr McNarry]</span>.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Which amendment was:</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Leave out all after &lsquo;supports&rsquo; and insert:</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">&lsquo;improving the efficiency and effectiveness of government;  recognises the need for new scrutiny and oversight arrangements in the Assembly  to permanently pursue such ends; calls on the First and deputy First Minister  to make a statement on their proposals for an Efficiency Review Panel; notes  the review procedures set out in the Belfast Agreement and the Northern Ireland  Act 1998 to provide for agreed changes to the institutions, including the size  and structure of the Assembly and the institutional workings of the Executive;  further notes the role of the Assembly and Executive Review Committee in  examining such matters; calls on that Committee to accelerate consideration of  changes to the number of MLAs and the number of government Departments; and  asks it to produce a report this year outlining proposals which respect the  principles of proportional representation and inclusion.&rsquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Mr  M Durkan]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: One  would be forgiven for thinking that there is a touch of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu in Mr McNarry&rsquo;s  motion, given that it was Members of the DUP who brought the issue to the House  on 19 January 2009. However, Mr McNarry has been accused of recycling DUP  speeches for his own use before, so it should be considered nothing new if he  does the same with motions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McNarry&rsquo;s justification for tabling his motion was that  the motion tabled by the DUP in January was a stunt. However, that does not  hold much water, given that he has tabled exactly the same motion. Looking back  at the debate on that motion on 19 January, it is interesting to note the  comments of some Members from the Ulster Unionist Party, who spoke with scepticism  and questioned the relevance of the motion. I am glad that those Members have  changed their minds and are now, just a few months later, in full support of  DUP policy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McNarry knows why we have an inflated Assembly. It is  because of the role that his party played in creating a swollen number of  Departments and in ensuring that there are 108 Assembly Members. That was not  done for efficiency but so that the minor parties could be represented in the  Chamber and Sinn F&eacute;in could be represented at the Executive table. Before  devolution in 1998, the NIO was able to operate with only six Departments.  Perhaps we should look at that model of government and use it as a starting  point when we consider the shape that reform should take in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">From the outset, the Democratic Unionist Party opposed the  structures that were set up as part of the Belfast Agreement, and it has  maintained that position since it became the largest party in the Assembly.  Just last week, we launched &lsquo;Driving forward a reform agenda&rsquo;, a document which  outlines many of the structural changes that are required at Stormont,  including a reduction in the number of Assembly Members to, perhaps, 54 or 72  and a reduction in the number of Departments to six or seven. However, perhaps  we should take the process of slimming down the Executive in stages; we could  start with eight Departments and work backwards. In addition, we have said that  there should be an end to mandatory coalition, a streamlining of the Office of  the First Minister and deputy First Minister, an end to the designation process  and an end to the financial waste that is associated with certain North/South  bodies, various quangos and the Civic Forum. When it comes to reform, it is the  DUP that comes up with the ideas and policies.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I listened to Mr O&rsquo;Dowd&rsquo;s comments earlier in the debate.  Any reform agendas proposed by the DUP do not seek a return to single-party  rule; there must be built-in protections for all minority communities and, if  we are changing the designation system, there could be weighted-majority voting  in the Chamber. It is important that we move to more democratic structures. With  regard to the Equality Commission and other such quangos, we seek not to  abolish all of their agendas but to bring them together for efficiency  purposes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At a time when we are moving forward with the RPA and  reducing the number of councils across Northern Ireland, it is a good time  to start looking at what we can do here. The reasons for such reform are  twofold. First, the money that is saved can be redirected towards front line  services. Secondly, we can come up with more streamlined, effective and  efficient structures so that, for example, voluntary groups that are struggling  to find funding do not have to go to three or four Departments and get shunted  from one place to another.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Reform is also needed so that we have more consistent and  structured planning within certain Departments, particularly the Department of  Education. All Members will have dealt with voluntary and community groups that  have had difficulties in finding the right Department to get funding from.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Education is a prime example. The Department of Education  is responsible for a young person until he or she leaves school, but once they  leave school they are the responsibility of the Department for Employment and  Learning. We should consider a single Department for lifelong learning similar  to that in Scotland;  most people would recognise that as a sensible way forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We can see examples of how other devolved institutions in  the United Kingdom, in Cardiff or in Edinburgh,  have slimmed down their Executives and how they organise their Departments. We  heard earlier that the Welsh Assembly has 60 Members and the Scottish  Parliament 129. Compared to the populations of those regions and the number of  their elected representatives, Northern    Ireland is massively over-represented. We  need change.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We must welcome the intention to establish the efficiency  review panel and the ongoing review of North/South bodies. At this time of  tighter finances, it is important that the House send out the message that it  supports reform and greater efficiency. This issue also presents a challenge  for nationalist Members to examine genuinely some of the North/South structures  and ask whether they provide value for money, particularly in the light of  recent comments by the Irish Government about slimming them down.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Member to bring his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I  support the motion but reject the amendment.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Like my colleague John O&rsquo;Dowd, I  cast some scorn on the motion and the amendment; today&rsquo;s debate is a wee bit of  a sham fight.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Good Friday Agreement and the underpinning structures  of these institutions contain the facility for the formal reviews about which  Members have been speaking. The Assembly and Executive Review Committee  includes the deputy leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, one of whose members  tabled the motion, and SDLP representation. Therefore, the parties that tabled  the motion and the amendment are represented on the Assembly and Executive  Review Committee and are fully aware that that Committee, in its workload and  forward planning, has already agreed to fulfil its remit by undertaking to  review the institutions to which the motion and amendment refer. Moreover,  OFMDFM recently announced the establish&shy;ment of an efficiency review panel.  Therefore, the Ulster Unionists and the SDLP are fully aware that there already  exists the wherewithal to carry out such a review. The matter was, as Members  have said, well debated in the House not too long ago; therefore, Sinn F&eacute;in  cannot see why the motion and its proposed amendment have been tabled today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to reiterate some of John O&rsquo;Dowd&rsquo;s comments. All  parties had the opportunity in the review of public administration and the  reform of local government to cut back on bureaucracy in the interests of  efficiency and effectiveness &mdash; underpinned by equality and community balance &mdash;  but they failed to do so. There remains in the RPA the clear need and ability  to review and downsize the number of quangos. In every debate on this matter in  recent years, Members regularly referred to the number of quangos or  unaccountable bodies as some might call them. Yet we have never managed the  type of cull that is required for a number of those agencies and groups. That  is work that we need to undertake, and it is within the remit of the review of  public administration. It is being spearheaded under the tutelage of the  Minister of the Environment, Sammy Wilson, but all parties are involved through  the strategic leadership board. Therefore, all parties have had the opportunity  and will continue to have the opportunity to ensure that they maximise and put  into practice all the demands and assertions that they are making here again  today. I have heard plenty of demands but no commitments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The leader of the SDLP, Mark Durkan, whose party tabled an  amendment to the motion, said that his party had raised the idea of taking away  one of the existing Departments, instead of creating an additional Department  to facilitate the transfer of justice powers. However, that proposal was never  made in my time. No Member or party put that proposal to the Assembly and  Executive Review Committee before it produced its latest report, which was  endorsed by the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members said that they want to make proposals, and  they outlined a number of them, such as approaching the Boundary Commission to  seek a reduction in the number of elected representatives. However, those  proposals have not been formally made by any party. We talk about reducing the  number of MLAs, cutting back on the number of Departments, quangos and so on,  but not one proposal has been put before the Committee to back any of that up.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">John O&rsquo;Dowd made the point that we are in the mouth of an  election. Parties want to hear themselves talking and to be seen to place  issues on the agenda as though they are trying to do something about them.  However, when they have had the opportunity to do something about such issues,  they have failed miserably.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are not wedded to any number of Departments, and we are  strongly committed to ensuring that the institutions are efficient and  effective. However, those institutions were built on the basis of ensuring that  we have a participative democracy and that we have inclusion. That is why we  have the number of MLAs per constituency that has served us well so far. Nevertheless,  we are fully prepared to see through the review in a non-prescriptive manner.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: We  are living in an era when the public are demanding change, and the House needs  to take on board what the public are saying. Everything that has happened in the  past few weeks has brought the public&rsquo;s focus and attention to issues around  politics and how it works. We have stated for some time how this place could  work better and how we could do a better service for the public at a lower  cost. Ultimately, it would be a notable achievement if we could arrive at the  point at which we are delivering a better service to the public at a lower  cost. Many of the proposals that have been set out indicate how that can be  done.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At St Andrews, many of the  unsavoury aspects of the Belfast Agreement were amended until we reached a  situation in which we had a means of taking matters forward, but the task is  not complete; there is still work to be done. I do not think that a mandatory  coalition is the way forward. Although that arrangement may serve us  temporarily, ultimately we need to work towards bringing the process to a  conclusion, to the point at which we have normality and a voluntary coalition  that can represent a broad scope of the community in Northern Ireland without being  exclusive.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is also work to be done to make government more  efficient. I recall wondering why there was a need for 108 MLAs when I first  read the Belfast Agreement. However, it was obvious that the system was  designed to get as many people as possible from as many backgrounds as possible  into the Assembly. There were parties such as the Women&rsquo;s Coalition, the UDP  and the PUP, but the only party that remains in the Assembly is the Progressive  Unionist Party. The other parties have been dealt with by the electors, who  have said that they do not want those parties to represent them. Therefore,  there is no point in having additional seats to bring those people into this  forum &mdash; they cannot get elected even with those extra seats.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Civic Forum was a laughing stock, and I have heard  people from various parties attempt to defend it for some time. The Civic Forum  had no credibility, and it will have no credibility in the future if we are  foolish enough to re-establish it. However, I do not believe that that will  happen. Many of the North/South bodies have demonstrated themselves to be  fairly ineffective, and I do not believe that we can continue putting in the  sort of money that is going to those bodies unless they are more effective and  can deliver for people. We cannot have them just for the sake of having them.  That would be a political decision, and that is not acceptable.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Then, of course, there were the 10 Departments.  Many of us were aghast when we moved from six to 10 Departments. Was that done  for the public&rsquo;s benefit, or was it a political carve-up by the two main  parties of the time, the Ulster Unionists and the SDLP? Of course it was  political carve-up.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Ten years later, I am glad that the Ulster Unionists have  woken up, smelt the coffee and realised, &ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ve got this wrong; in fact,  we&rsquo;ve got it badly wrong.&rdquo; Ulster Unionist Members are now jumping on to the  DUP bandwagon, on which they are very welcome, by acknowledging that we must  have more efficient government.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I know that David McNarry was around at that time, for I  often saw him and David Trimble together. When the designers tell the Assembly  that what they designed is wrong, is bad and is no longer fit for purpose &mdash; I  see that designer David is shaking his head &mdash; it is reasonable to conclude that  the DUP got it right at the time. With the Ulster Unionists on board, we need  others to join us, including the SDLP, by admitting that they also got it wrong  and by starting to deliver more efficient government for the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>:  Does the Member recognise that it is not only Ulster Unionist MLAs who now  support DUP policy? Some of the party&rsquo;s members in North Down are leaving the  Ulster Unionist Party to join the DUP.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member will be allowed an extra minute.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  What about Jim Allister?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Thank you very much. Those Ulster Unionists will always be very welcome. Mr  Kennedy asks, &ldquo;What about Jim Allister?&rdquo;. I suggest that he will be making that  comment again in a few weeks&rsquo; time. However, we will wait and see. The  electorate will have the opportunity to consider that issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We cannot continue to argue for 108 Members. I look to Sinn  F&eacute;in, which appears quite defensive about changing anything here in case it  undermines some of its political agenda. However, we cannot tell the public  that 108 MLAs are required. That argument cannot be made to the public. I  declare here today that I am prepared to go into an election in which there are  fewer seats for MLAs in my constituency, and if I lose my seat, so be it. For  the sake of the general public, we must plan to reduce the number of MLAs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We must also challenge the Civil Service, which is grossly  overmanned. In particular, we must reduce its middle management. How can we  challenge the Civil Service when the Assembly is overmanned in the first place?  Therefore, for MLAs to vote to reduce their numbers is like turkeys voting for  Christmas. Nonetheless, that is what must be done in the wider public interest.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  It is interesting that this debate follows the discussion on health, in which I  was pleased that the Minister gave another assurance of his commitment to free  personal care for the elderly. That has been an Ulster Unionist Party  commitment for some time and one on which it has delivered. More delivery is  required of this Government. Let it be clear: we will not get delivery by sitting  on our hands. We can all shout back and forward in the Chamber, but what we  really want is practical, working politics.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When we consider the motion that my colleague Mr McNarry  tabled, we must look back at the St Andrews Agreement. We hear all the talk  about the Belfast Agreement, but look back to the more recent St Andrews  Agreement. The opportunity to make various changes at that time was not taken.  Yes, we were promised a review panel. A press release from OFMDFM in April  stated that proposals on the appointment of that panel would be brought to this  place after Easter. I suppose that OFMDFM remains within that timescale,  because it is still after Easter. However, we are almost in the summer, so it  may come about after the summer. We must have more than a statement that  outlines a vague timescale. We must have real proposals. We must see the panel  appointed, up and running and delivering.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We must have efficiencies. Members badger our Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety in the Chamber about efficiencies  that, given more money, he would not be required to find. The only way to get  to that position is by starting to make changes in this place. I hear Members  who have been here for years saying that that is their policy, but they have not  done much about it up until now. Therefore, it is time that we all got real and  started making the necessary changes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are also aware that, while other Departments and their  budgets are being squeezed, the number of staff in OFMDFM has increased hugely  since the two larger parties took over two years ago.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is unfortunate that the SDLP tabled its amendment. The  Ulster Unionist Party will not support it. I ask the SDLP to reconsider and to  support our motion, which I believe is real and practical. We all want the  efficiency review panel to report within six months. Is there anybody here who  does not want that? I hope and trust that the SDLP will help us.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We also need real, practical government. I am sometimes fed  up with the &ldquo;we cannot do it because&rdquo; attitude, which means that somebody has  blown the dust off a four-year-old consultation report and highlighted a  paragraph to a Minister that states that the matter in question cannot be  addressed. We must have a system that is about real politics and about people  here making decisions that help and support people. That is what was expected  of us when we were elected, and it is what we have to deliver.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Sometimes, it is very unfortunate that, because we or,  indeed, the Senior Civil Service cannot make decisions, we pay a fortune to  have a consultation report done. If we are to stand for election, we have to be  big enough to make the necessary decisions and get on with life. The business  world is screaming for us to get on, do the work and make those decisions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have not always been critical of the Civil Service, but I  have had my day. The practical reality is that decisions have to be made. Some  career civil servants and people who work in government have never lived in the  real world. A person should not reach the Senior Civil Service unless they have  served in the private sector for four years. That would ensure that they know  what the real world is about.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I ask Members to get behind our motion and to let us move  on with good government.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  The first question is: why did the Ulster Unionist Party table the motion  today? Surely the answer is to do with recent DUP comments about and proposals  on this issue; the Ulster Unionists feel that getting a slice of that action  would be beneficial to them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When we are considering an issue such as this, it is  important that it is approached seriously. The motion does not do that. It is  simplistic and incomplete. It does not do justice to the seriousness of the  issue. That is the reason why we produced a substantial amendment and the  reason why we cannot support the motion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In many ways, the motion is a surrogate for recent DUP  views. My criticisms of the motion apply even more to the plethora of recent  DUP comments about this issue. I will say something about the technical  weakness of the DUP arguments in a moment, but I will first talk about the  reason that the DUP has made such comments recently. Very often, the reason is  more important than the detail and tells us a good deal more about the current  state of politics and what could come out of that situation. There are real  dangers in the way that the DUP is presenting the debate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The first reason that the DUP is presenting its case is to  try to divert the public from far more pressing issues, such as the fact that  it is failing to deliver on the vital issue of economic change. It has been  mentioned that an election is coming up in a couple of weeks. It is hardly a  coincidence that so much of this talk is recent. The DUP wants to pretend that  the focus on apparent efficiency makes a major contribution to improving our  economic state or that it is at least a signal of what the party would describe  as moving in the right direction. That is a false lesson, and I hope that the  public will not be fooled by it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My second criticism is that underlying the philosophy of  cutting the number of MLAs and Departments is a belief that somehow Northern Ireland  can be made into a normal place. My response to that is that Northern Ireland is not and cannot  ever be a normal place. Mechanisms have been created with great difficulty and  considerable pain over many years.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: On  the Member&rsquo;s first point that it is a recent conversion that has led the DUP to  push the subject for electoral purposes, does he not concede that it has in  fact been Democratic Unionist Party policy for the past 10 years? When the  Belfast Agreement established the Assembly, we said that the institution was  inflated and needed to be reduced in size, and that message has been  consistent.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On the Member&rsquo;s second point about the number of MLAs, does  he not recognise that Northern    Ireland is far over-represented compared  with anywhere else in the world? That needs to change if we are really to take  the Assembly seriously.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member may have an extra minute.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  If the DUP were serious about making changes, it has had two years in which to  deliver them. The party has had it fully within its legal powers to bring  measures to the Assembly before now, yet it has not done so.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have created mechanisms to deal with a very complex  society; one that contains very real and deep tensions. Nobody should believe  for a moment that those tensions can be eradicated by tinkering with the  structures. Let me voice an alternative approach, which is to stop worrying so  much about tinkering with the structures and to focus more on making those  structures work. If Members read our amendment, they will see precise methods  that would make those structures work even better. Such an approach would make  a big difference to the way in which much of the business is conducted here.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I must comment on the technical weakness of the DUP case.  Nigel Dodds states that cutting the number of MLAs and Departments will save  &pound;40 million to &pound;50 million. I am amazed at the extent to which that figure has  been bought without thought by so many Members. Cutting the number of MLAs to  72 would save the sum of &pound;4 million a year or perhaps a little more if the  offices at Stormont and so on were taken into account. Joining together  Departments does not necessarily save money, unless things are done  consequently. However, those things could be done anyway without the need to  join together Departments. In our recent document, the SDLP advocated ways in  which we might save considerable sums of public money. The argument for  reducing the number of MLAs and Departments comes from a lead party in the  Assembly that runs three economic policy units yet has not thought to eradicate  that bit of complexity. That really shows where the DUP is coming from.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some gains can be made from having a larger number of  Departments. If they are run properly, greater opportunities arise for the  public, key groups and individuals to interface with our Ministers, and that is  what the public are looking for from a working Assembly. That is something that  we should value and make work. Of course, change will be needed in due course,  but, in the meantime, do not simply create a smokescreen around the issue,  which is what this debate largely does. When change is made, do not throw out  the baby with the bath water but ensure that our Government remain fully  inclusive; otherwise, the Government still have the potential to collapse. If  the DUP is serious about making government more efficient, set that in the much  broader context of public sector reform. Restructuring the Executive and the  Assembly is only one aspect of public sector reform, and, arguably, it is  neither the most urgent nor has it the most potential for real gain.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  The essential difference between what the SDLP amendment proposes and what the  UUP motion proposes is political ownership of the agenda of efficiency and  effectiveness to produce a proper political way forward. Our method is more  rounded and more balanced and will produce a fairer outcome. The Ulster Unionist  motion puts all the eggs in one basket, and that basket is the Office of the  First Minister and deputy First Minister.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members should warn themselves against adopting that  mechanism. There are two or three reasons for my saying that. One reason is that  the temptation in OFMDFM, as Members have seen in too many instances over the  past two years, has been to act in a partisan or partial way. The temptation to  do so in respect of this issue will manifest itself in due course as well.</p>

    <p class="B3BodyText">If Members do not believe in that argument, they should  accept that it is folly to believe the notion that OFMDFM will come forward  with proposals within the next six months, as proposed in the motion. Members  should consider the facts. In two years, OFMDFM has failed to present proposals  on a range of high-profile and important issues around victims, sharing and  cohesion. Furthermore, in the past two weeks, we have heard two Ministers &mdash; one  from the DUP and one from the Ulster Unionist Party &mdash; say that, once again, things  are getting held up in OFMDFM, and Executive business is not getting turned  over. Even the UUP&rsquo;s Health Minister is saying that he cannot get OFMDFM and  the Executive to sign off important proposals. Why, therefore, should we give  OFMDFM more authority on an issue around which there could be all sorts of  mischief-making?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">DUP Members made some interesting observations, but I was  astounded that Simon Hamilton and the other DUP Members who spoke missed the  obvious irony of today&rsquo;s debate. It is four months to the day since the DUP  motion on reducing the number of Departments was passed, but OFMDFM has been so  inefficient that it has not moved forward with the membership of the proposed  efficiency review panel. The irony of that should not escape anyone.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with my colleague Mr O&rsquo;Loan. What worries me as  much as anything about the DUP&rsquo;s ambitions is its attempt to reconfigure the  equality, human rights and wider issues in Northern society. When it was fully  developed, our conflict revolved around issues of law, order and justice.  Unfortunately, a small number of people in state organisations and in terror  groups took that difference to the point of murder and mayhem.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I will give way in a second. We have learned from our 30-year experience about  how to create a balance of institutional safeguards and mechanisms to protect  equality, human rights and policing and justice arrangements, and if the DUP  proposes to unpick all that &mdash; under the guise of efficiency and effectiveness &mdash;  it does so at some peril. Those institutions, which can work better, are a  consequence of our conflict that revolved around those rubbing points, and the  DUP needs to be cautious in looking at that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to reserve my final comments for Sinn F&eacute;in.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  Apparently, I will not be given extra time if I give way during a winding-up  speech.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: You will, Mr Attwood.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I will give way to the Member.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  The Member said that the original agreement was based around law, order and  justice. However, at that time, one could be in Government and not support law  and order. In fact, punishment beatings were being perpetrated by the IRA while  a Sinn F&eacute;in Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety was in post.  It was at the DUP&rsquo;s insistence that parties had to support law and order before  they could enter Government. That is the difference between now and then.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member has an extra minute in which to speak.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I do not walk away from some of the consequences of what the Member has said.  My point is that our national conflict revolved around issues of law, order and  justice. At any one time during the conflict, the rubbing points were disputes,  differences and divisions about how law, order and justice were &mdash; or were not &mdash;  administered in the North. Look at parades, our courts and the kangaroo courts  of the IRA and others. They were the rubbing points of our conflict, and the  institutional arrangements of the Good Friday Agreement were meant to resolve  that and, for all their inefficiencies, they have contributed to that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">John O&rsquo;Dowd said that Sinn F&eacute;in would oppose any measures  to undermine the entitlements of the Good Friday Agreement. How hollow does  that sound? Sinn F&eacute;in has conceded the entitlement of the Good Friday Agreement  and d&rsquo;Hondt in its proposal for a justice Minister, and it conceded the  entitlements of ministerial authority through its sell-out to the DUP at St Andrews.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When people hear that sort of language, they know that Sinn  F&eacute;in says one thing &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member must draw his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  &mdash; but does something absolutely different.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I am grateful for the opportunity to wind up the debate on behalf of the Ulster  Unionist Party. It has been interesting to listen to the pre-election gambits  of the various representatives. Nonetheless, the motion was brought forward as  a serious proposal, and I welcome the fact that, at least, we have all had an  opportunity to air our views on it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will deal first with Members&rsquo; contributions. Obviously,  Mr Durkan thinks that the SDLP amendment has more merit than the motion. From  my party&rsquo;s point of view, the proper focus has to remain on the First Minister  and deputy First Minister and their Department. Having made announcements, they  should bring forward proposals as they have promised. The SDLP amendment seeks  only to confuse people and to throw in, at this stage, additional issues that  are not helpful.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Hamilton from the Democratic Unionist Party said that it  had always been the DUP&rsquo;s view that it was a lone voice in calling for the  number of MLAs and Departments to be reduced. It seemed strange that although  he mentioned the various reforms through which the DUP had effected savings and  caused public expenditure to be reduced, the one issue that he did not mention  was the appointment of four victims&rsquo; commissioners. That seemed to increase  public expenditure, rather than reduce it. However, I am sure that he will  address that oversight at some stage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr O&rsquo;Dowd was unconvinced by the arguments and took a  cynical view on why we were talking about the issue today. He promised us that  no changes would be made to the Good Friday Agreement as Sinn F&eacute;in saw it, and  we have heard the SDLP view on that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am grateful to Naomi Long for indicating that the  Alliance Party supports the motion. She said, rightly, that the original  conditions were designed to meet the political needs of the time. However,  nothing lasts forever, and the law of the Medes and Persians does not apply  here. Changes can come.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am glad to see that Mr Ross is in his place. Until he  spoke, he seemed to be the only person in the House, if not in Northern  Ireland, who believed that there was no connection whatsoever between the  Belfast Agreement and the St Andrews Agreement and that the architecture,  somehow, had been changed fundamentally as a result of what the DUP did &mdash; or  some would say, failed to do &mdash; as part of the St Andrews Agreement. His  contribution today could best be described as being on election message; it did  not represent hard reality.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Alex Maskey reinforced the view given earlier by Mr  O&rsquo;Dowd. He even mentioned the sham fight. As someone who attends the sham fight  in Scarva every year, I have yet to see Mr Maskey witness it. Nevertheless, it  was interesting that he mentioned it. He also mentioned the Assembly and  Executive Review Committee, and he seemed somewhat irked that that Committee  had not been given responsibility for looking at the issues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Poots acted as a cheerleader for Mr Ross&rsquo;s earlier  contribution. The world began at St Andrews as  far as the DUP is concerned. Nobody else did anything of any substance before  that. Mr Poots said that turkeys in this place could be voting for Christmas  and, in the cold reality of day, it will be interesting to see whether that  will ever happen.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Elliott brought a sense of proportion back to the debate  and reminded us that this place ought to be about delivery and the practical  working of politics &mdash; real politics and not some of the airy-fairy stuff in the  political bubble and froth that we hear and deal with.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am glad that Mr O&rsquo;Loan is in his place. I was concerned  about one particular section of his contribution where he said that Northern Ireland:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;cannot ever be &hellip; a normal place.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I think that I have quoted him accurately. That is  entirely the wrong attitude for any Member. We are all here to make Northern Ireland  a better place. We are certainly in a better place than that from which we have  come, and we look forward in a constructive way. The negative view expressed by  Mr O&rsquo;Loan was a matter of regret, and I hope that he will address it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Attwood said that it was a matter of political ownership  and that the SDLP amendment would be much better and more balanced. However,  the Ulster Unionist Party believes that the focus remains, and should remain,  with the two parties that currently lead the Executive. They have promised us  proposals; let us examine those proposals and keep the focus more narrow at  this stage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Last week, the deputy First Minister called his colleague  the First Minister&rsquo;s proposals for cutting Government waste &ldquo;shallow  electioneering&rdquo;. It would appear that the deputy First Minister is correct &mdash;  and he does not often receive praise from me. The Ulster Unionist Party, in its  partnership with the Conservative Party, is the only party that can enact real  change in the areas that the First Minister was talking about. It is only on  the national stage &mdash; the United Kingdom stage, of which we are all a part &mdash;  that we can bring down the cost and size of Government and make a difference to  tax bills. The First Minister will realise that in about a year&rsquo;s time.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Of course, the First Minister does not have to do anything  about the pledges that he makes now. He can, it seems, quite safely make  sweeping statements about all manner of things in relation to Governments and  quangos, safe in the knowledge that Sinn F&eacute;in will not let him do it. Such  grandstanding and headline-grabbing are the stock-in-trade of the Democratic  Unionist Party. It is not a party of responsibility but one of cynical  political advantage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My friend the Minister of Health has shown that the Ulster  Unionist Party is committed to making and delivering firm policy commitments,  including the abolition of prescription charges. We are serious about considering  the issue of reducing the size of Government structures, which is why the motion  calls for the efficiency review panel to appear from the haze in OFMDFM.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have not been grandstanding with nonsense figures such  as &pound;50 million of savings. We know, and are prepared to say, that any savings  will be nothing like that. If the number of MLAs were cut to 72, it would, as  we have heard already, save only &pound;4 million. The Finance Minister is staring  into a black hole, and having slightly fewer MLAs would provide him with mere  pocket money, not the real savings that he has to make. We want to consider  reducing the number of MLAs because it is the right thing to do, not because it  will solve all our financial problems &mdash; it will not.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText"><span class="Italic">Question</span>, That the amendment be  made, <span class="Italic">put and negatived.</span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Main Question put and agreed to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That this Assembly supports, in principle, the  restructuring of the Northern Ireland Executive and the Assembly in order to  improve the efficiency and effectiveness of government; and calls on the First  Minister and deputy First Minister to update the Assembly on the proposals for  the creation of an Efficiency Review Panel, as announced on 9 April 2009, and  to agree to implement a review and produce a report on the issue of the number  of MLAs and government Departments in the next Assembly, within the next six  months.</p>
