                saddened by what took place in Lurgan yesterday when the
                supporters, who were supposed to be celebrating their victory,
                not only attacked the police and the Protestant people, but, to
                add insult to injury, hung a tricolour on the war memorial. On
                the previous night, there was a savage attack on places of
                worship in Keady. The Orange hall was painted over, the gospel
                hall’s windows were smashed, a beautiful stained glass window
                in the Presbyterian church was smashed, and the Church of
                Ireland church was also smashed.</p>

                occurred there yesterday. The fact is that GAA supporters were

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr O’Hagan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to correct an erroneous statement. I
                come from Lurgan and know the situation on the ground. GAA
                supporters were attacked by a Loyalist/ Unionist mob. The PSNI
                failed to protect GAA supporters in Lurgan yesterday.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. I must ask the Member to take her
                seat. Order.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is quite clear that we have gone well
                beyond points of order and that we are now into points of
                disorder in the Chamber.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will advise the House of my ruling on the
                issue. First, it is entirely in order for the Chairperson of the
                Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure to bring to his
                Committee the question of whether it would like to hold a
                reception to celebrate this event. He knows from previous
                occasions that if the Committee wants to hold such a reception,
                but does not have the resources to do so, and he approaches the
                Speaker’s Office, he will get the same positive response to
                this particular request, should it come from the Committee, as
                he had in respect of previous requests. That is the appropriate
                way to deal with this.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Responding to Mr Kelly’s point of order, it
                is not possible for the Assembly to make such a gesture without
                having a motion for debate. The Member may wish to put down such
                a motion, but it would, of course, lose something in terms of
                the timing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Paisley mentioned some concerns, and Dr O’Hagan
                mentioned her concerns about the same point. I ask that Members
                compose themselves, not only on this matter, but also on the
                general business of the day. It is a funny old place here. I do
                not suppose I imagined that I would find Nationalists demanding
                that Stormont have orange flags outside it, and Unionists
                expressing a degree of concern about that. However, that would
                be the circumstance if the Armagh team were here celebrating.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask members of the Committee for Culture,
                Arts and Leisure to consider if that is the appropriate context
                in which to deal with this matter. If the Committee has a view
                on this, and comes to the Speaker’s Office, it will receive
                the usual generous reply that my Office tries to give to these
                matters.</p>

                2 September 2002, my Colleagues and I tabled a motion that
                called for the dissolution of the Assembly to enable an election
                to take place. We recognised then — as most of the House will
                recognise now — that the Assembly will lurch from one crisis

                basis for the motion, Mr Speaker, surely you can use your
                influence to ensure that a large group of Members who wish to
                see a motion debated can have the opportunity to do so, and then
                we can move to elections, negotiations and the possibility of
                real, stable political structures in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is clearly a matter for the Business
                Committee to decide what goes on the Order Paper as far as
                private Members’ business is concerned. In the past, I have
                indicated that — <i>[Interruption]. </i>Order.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When motions are set down and have some
                statutory basis, which I think is the reference that the Member
                is making, if there is some reasonable chance of success as
                evidenced by support within the Business Committee to have the
                debate, one, as the Chairperson, might well urge the Business
                Committee to consider the matter. I cannot do more. I am the one
                member of the Business Committee who does not have a vote, and I
                do not seek to influence it politically in any way, except to do
                what is wise for the general well-being of the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course, the Member’s Colleagues are at
                liberty to raise the matter in the Business Committee, which
                will meet tomorrow to consider next week’s business.
                Therefore, it will be a matter for the Business Committee to
                consider. I dare say that its members will consider the
                question, taking full account, as business managers, of what
                they judge to be the likely approach of their parties to the
                matter. That is not a wholly unreasonable way for them to
                consider the question.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further to that point of order, Mr Speaker. I
                am more concerned after listening to your response. Surely it
                can never be the Business Committee’s role to make judgements
                either on the outcome of a motion or on the basis of whether it
                likes or agrees with the principles behind it. The Assembly has
                the right to consider matters and reject them if so desired. The
                Business Committee does not have a veto in determining which
                particular political party policies should be allowed to be
                aired in the Chamber.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some Members:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Hear, hear.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. Nor did I suggest that that was the
                case. Since there is a long list of no-day-named motions, the
                Member is asking the Business Committee to put the particular
                motion from his party ahead of other motions. I am saying that
                as far as the Business Committee is concerned, I would certainly
                urge it to consider an extra degree of significance to motions
                that bear on the statutory basis of the Assembly. The Business
                Committee must make its own judgements.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I dare say that the Business
                Committee will make a judgement on the basis of what it believes
                to be the motion’s level of support. For example, since no
                seconder is even necessary, it would be entirely possible for a
                single Member to table a motion that was on a statutory matter
                of the type referred to. The Member would judge it not
                reasonable that that on its own should take precedence over
                everything else. Of course the Member is saying that this motion
                does not involve a single Member, but a significant body. In
                other words, he is saying that the level of support is
                significant. That is simply all that I am pointing out also —
                the level of support is significant and not unreasonably so in
                the mind of the Business Committee when making a judgement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would be wholly inappropriate to bring the
                discussions of the Business Committee on to the Floor. I am
                simply ruling on the procedural question. I trust that the
                Member is at least clear on the question, if not entirely happy.</p>

                the House that what you have said is exactly what happens. The
                Business Committee was unable to judge the level of support for
                the DUP motion because the DUP Chief Whip withdrew that

  <font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have received notice from the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister that they wish to make a
                statement on behalf of the Executive on the draft Programme for
                Government 2003-2004. Following a proposal from the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister the Business Committee
                considered the form in which the Programme for Government should
                be presented to the House and agreed that it should be presented
                in the form of a statement today. A motion to take note of the
                draft Programme for Government will be debated tomorrow.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Business Committee agreed to a different
                form of statement. As the House is aware, statements are usually
                followed by a series of questions to the Minister, or Ministers,
                who make the statement. However, in view of the fact that the
                Programme for Government is a singular presentation, it was
                viewed as appropriate — and the proposal came from the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister — that party leaders
                should not be restricted to simply asking questions, but should
                have the opportunity to make a statement for up to five minutes,
                obviating the need for questions or response.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister and the Deputy First
                Minister will make their presentation, and all parties will have
                an opportunity, restricted to the party leader or a nominee, to
                make a response lasting five minutes. If that is clear, we will
                proceed.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister (Mr Trimble):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister and I have pleasure
                in presenting to the Assembly, on behalf of the Executive, our
                draft Programme for Government covering the next financial year
                and beyond. At its meeting on Thursday 19 September, the
                Executive agreed a draft Programme for Government, supported by
                a draft Budget. We are laying that programme before the Assembly
                for scrutiny and for future approval after examination in
                Committees.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The draft Programme for Government sets out
                the Executive’s plans and priorities for the next few years,
                and will be supported by the draft Budget to be presented to the
                Assembly tomorrow by the Minister of Finance and Personnel. The
                Programme for Government is a detailed and comprehensive
                document, and Members will know that it is not a quick and easy
                read. We could translate the document and merely present a
                series of sound bites taking up a few pages, but we believe that
                it is important that the Assembly and others should see our
                plans and priorities in some detail and understand the context
                in which they are to be taken forward. Members should have the
                necessary information to carry out their role in scrutinising
                the document.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have been keen to build on the progress
                already made as an Executive when developing this programme. We
                have the experience of developing and implementing two previous
                programmes that have been endorsed by the Assembly. We want to
                use that experience and build on our achievements to steer us
                through the months and years ahead.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have achieved much, and there is much that
                we can be proud of. We have shown that we can work together
                across all four parties in the Administration to plan for, and
                deliver, good government. We have brought about real
                improvements in areas as diverse as education, infrastructure
                and the needs of children. We have demonstrated a commitment to
                accountability and a readiness to report openly on our progress
                that is unparalleled.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a time for commitment, not
                complacency. This draft programme demonstrates our commitment to
                deliver government that makes a real and positive difference to
                the lives of people here. Reinvestment and reform are the twin
                elements at the core of this programme; they must underpin our
                efforts to make a difference in the years ahead. We also want to
                deliver real progress in tackling social exclusion, promoting
                sustainable development and building stronger partnerships —
                partnerships with local government and the social partners in
                influencing the development of policies and programmes and their
                delivery. We have highlighted in our draft Programme for
                Government those key themes that cut across our priorities, and
                we will say more about them shortly. Members will have received
                a copy of the document, and the chapter on investing in the
                future sets out further details.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another feature of this year’s document is
                our wish to bring out more clearly than before the context in
                which our economic, social and environmental policies and
                programmes are developed and implemented. We should not develop
                new policies or continue with existing ones without a clear
                understanding of the economy and society, and the challenges
                which the Executive and Assembly face. Chapter 2 of the document
                sets out the current position on some key indicators, the
                improvements which have occurred and the problems which continue
                to exist. The Executive’s programme needs to address the
                challenges identified.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish now to focus on our commitments in
                this draft Programme for Government on investing in our
                infrastructure and promoting sustainable development. I also
                want to say something about our plans for modernising and
                developing public services. The Deputy First Minister will later
                pick up the theme of reform and also outline our work to tackle
                social exclusion and build partnerships.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This draft Programme for Government makes
                clear our commitment to delivering new and substantial
                investment in infrastructure. We know from the work on examining
                the opportunities for public-private partnerships that we have
                an estimated £6 billion investment deficit in that
                infrastructure. We must try to remedy that deficit over the next
                decade. The need to address that problem has been raised by
                Members, most recently in the debate last Monday.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tackling that deficit is not just about
                bricks and mortar, it is also about standards: the standard of
                education in our schools; the quality of treatment in our
                hospitals; the quality of our drinking water and the ability of
                our transport network to carry people and goods safely and
                effectively. It is about improving the infrastructure to improve
                the services that we all use.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In May 2002, we announced details of a new
                reinvestment and reform initiative designed to address the
                infrastructure problems that we have identified. In July 2002,
                we made a start in implementing the initiative. At that point we
                allocated £270 million to improve key areas of infrastructure.
                The draft Programme for Government reflects the work to date and
                our plans for the years ahead. We hope that in the first year
                covered by the programme, we shall have a new strategic
                investment board in place to assist us in improving the state of
                our infrastructure significantly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For example, the draft Programme for
                Government states our commitment to investing in the road
                network. We shall work to eliminate 75% of the road maintenance
                backlog over the period of the regional transportation strategy.
                We shall undertake improvements to our major routes, in
                particular building on our earlier commitment to upgrade the
                trans-European network from Larne to Newry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We shall strengthen our energy
                infrastructure. The draft programme contains our proposals in
                those areas. We are also determined to improve the health and
                education estates. We have already announced our plans for the
                new cancer centre — a development that should result in better
                diagnosis, treatment and care for those living with cancer. The
                draft programme signals our intention to increase capacity in
                hospitals, providing 100 more hospital beds by March 2005 to
                help ease the worst pressure points.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also set out our proposals to start more
                major capital improvements to primary and post-primary schools
                and to deliver a programme of investment to improve the state of
                our further education colleges. We shall also bring about
                improvements to our public library network.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the big challenges in taking forward
                this programme of investment is making sure it is sustainable.
                We have a duty and a responsibility to ensure that the
                improvements we make to meet our needs now are not at the
                expense of future generations’ ability to meet their needs.
                That message came across very clearly at the recent world summit
                in South Africa.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For that reason, we identify promoting
                sustainable living as a theme which cuts across all the
                Executive’s work — in improving infrastructure and public
                services and in tackling poverty and social exclusion. In the
                draft programme we set out many commitments, which reflect that
                theme — for example, through investing for health and in our
                approach to securing a competitive economy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On planning, for example, we wish to develop
                a more co-ordinated and efficient planning process that
                integrates our economic, social and environmental needs. That is
                why the draft programme commits us to modernising the planning
                process. We are also concerned about transport — and the draft
                Programme for Government highlights our determination to
                introduce measures to support public transport.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We recognise the need to reduce waste and
                tackle issues surrounding its disposal. For that reason, we have
                restated our intention to promote the recovery, or recycling, of
                25% of all household waste by 2006.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the principles of sustainable development
                need to underpin our work to address the infrastructure deficit,
                so too do they need to be reflected in our work to improve
                public services. The simple provision of more resources to
                improve our infrastructure will not result in the scale of
                change that the Executive want. That is why the focus in this
                draft programme is not just on reinvestment, but also on reform.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We want to deliver reform on several levels.</p>

                how the public sector operates, identifying new ways of working
                that will create real changes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course, change for change’s sake is
                never effective. We are determined that our driving force will
                be reform that brings real and measurable improvements that
                people can see, feel and experience. The draft Programme for
                Government sets out a challenging and ambitious programme that,
                when implemented, will bring about real change for the better.
                It contains many specific commitments that are supported by the
                draft Budget, which the Minister of Finance and Personnel will
                present to the Assembly tomorrow. It reflects our continuing
                focus on delivering progress across our five priorities in the
                context of the Executive’s key themes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The programme is in draft form; it is not set
                in stone. We want to consult on its content with the Assembly
                and more widely. We look forward to hearing the views of Members
                in tomorrow’s debate and over the coming weeks.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The draft Programme for Government represents
                another step forward in delivering accountable government that
                meets people’s needs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We launched a consultation on the Executive’s
                position report on 5 June to seek views on this year’s
                programme. We have received responses from Committees, the Civic
                Forum and other interested bodies, which have helped us to
                develop this draft. Based on those comments, the Executive
                concluded that the five priorities adopted before remain valid
                and should be retained. They are: growing as a community;
                working for a healthier people; investing in education and
                skills; securing a competitive economy; and developing
                relations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also identified relevant sub-priorities
                and specific proposed actions to support our priorities. Any
                commitments will have to be budgeted for in the draft Budget. It
                is right that, in all our priorities and at the heart of this
                Programme for Government, we focus on reinvestment and reform.
                We want to deliver modern, efficient public services. That will
                require investment and change.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to outline the areas for reform
                identified in the draft programme. I will also comment on our
                commitments on social exclusion and our work to build stronger
                partnerships.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The draft programme makes it clear that we
                must take a more innovative approach to managing and financing
                our infrastructure programme. The reinvestment and reform
                initiative has already demonstrated our desire to think
                differently and to challenge the traditional methods of public
                sector financing. We want to continue in that vein. The new
                strategic investment board<b> </b>will ensure that investment in
                our strategic infrastructure is planned and delivered in a way
                that makes the most of the resources and the expertise available
                to us.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our consultation on public-private
                partnerships (PPPs), which ended recently, is helping to shape
                our thinking on how to make best use of opportunities for PPPs
                in financing our future.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The creation of Executive programme funds has
                been another important innovation, and we will continue to use
                them to support actions to deliver progress in the five
                priorities. The draft Programme for Government makes it clear
                that there is other work to be done. Agreement must be reached
                on a fair rating system for Northern Ireland after the rating
                policy review, and we must continue to press for reform of the
                Barnett formula to ensure that our resources meet our needs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have underlined the importance that we
                attach to modernising government and to reform. The Executive
                intend to develop departmental plans to reform service delivery,
                including efficiency improvements and the use of assets. Those
                plans will be completed in the coming weeks and will feed into
                the departmental service delivery agreements to be developed
                later this year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We want to improve the quality of our public
                services and the structures for delivering them and to ensure
                that our efforts are targeted at those most in need. The draft
                Programme for Government sets out several commitments that the
                Executive are ready to make. We will continue our work to
                improve health and promote healthy lifestyles, modernise our
                hospital services and introduce new standards of clinical
                governance — all the while directing resources to those most
                in need and most vulnerable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Education will introduce
                new curricula in primary and post-primary schools that reflect
                the needs of our economy and society. We will also take action
                to ensure that young people leave school with the highest
                possible standards of literacy and numeracy. We will reduce the
                proportion of pupils in schools serving the most disadvantaged
                communities who leave school with no GCSEs and the number of
                poor attenders. The Executive intend to make changes to how the
                education system deals with children with special educational
                needs and to make sure that they can share equally in the
                planned improvements. The draft Programme for Government
                underlines the Executive’s commitment to having pupils with
                special educational needs educated, where possible, alongside
                their peers in mainstream schools.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another important focus will be welfare
                reform. The Executive want to play their part in implementing
                reforms to the social security and pensions systems. The draft
                Programme for Government commits us to joining up our jobs and
                benefits services. By March 2004, we will have extended a new
                jobs and benefits service to 20 combined social security and
                jobcentre offices across Northern Ireland. In line with a focus
                on putting work at the forefront of the benefits system, we want
                to improve services for those seeking work. In particular, we
                plan to take action to tackle poor literacy and numeracy in
                adults by helping an extra 2,500 learners to update their
                essential skills.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Agriculture and Rural
                Development is already implementing an ambitious programme of
                modernisation, focusing on the needs of farmers and the agrifood
                industry, e-government and the delivery of research and
                education. We will also implement the recommendations of the
                vision exercise.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive want to ensure that Invest
                Northern Ireland provides a new opportunity to improve
                competitiveness and encourage investment and enterprise. The
                draft Programme for Government sets out our plans in that area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also have key decisions to take over the
                life of the draft Programme for Government. We must reach
                agreement on the right structures for our acute hospitals and
                post-primary schools. We want to make sure that our decisions
                bring about positive improvements in the quality of service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must also reach agreement on the
                structures of public administration. The draft Programme for
                Government conveys our intention to introduce by the end of next
                year a new model for public administration. Our proposals will
                be driven by a desire to improve the delivery of public
                services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The draft Programme for Government also sets
                out our commitment to improve community relations and tackle
                division. The need to support the capacity of local communities
                to deal with matters of dispute or division is particularly
                important. Our experience in north Belfast and other areas has
                shown that improved relations can only develop when elected and
                community representatives work together. By the end of next
                year, we want to have in place a new policy and strategy on good
                relations, which will include actions and targets. We also want
                it to include action focused on local areas with acute community
                difficulties and action to support the capacity of local
                communities to deal with issues such as sectarian flags and
                graffiti.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we are to facilitate improvements in
                relations and an end to the trouble on our streets, we need to
                focus on delivering equality of opportunity for all. One of the
                greatest inequalities in Northern Ireland is that which exists
                between the affluent and the most disadvantaged. The draft
                Programme for Government emphasises, therefore, our
                determination to tackle poverty and social exclusion. It sets
                out our work to evaluate and improve our policy on targeting
                social need. It also highlights our determination to take action
                to root out child poverty.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The development of a children’s fund
                demonstrates our commitment to supporting children in need and
                young people at risk, a commitment which is restated in the
                draft Programme for Government. It also demonstrates the value
                of a partnership approach: working across sectors to do the best
                we can for children.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The draft Programme for Government represents
                what we can achieve by working in partnership in Government.
                However, we also need to build partnerships between the
                Government and social partners. It is not enough simply to
                change the form of government: our goal must be to change the
                face of the Government, the face of politics and the face of our
                society. Nor is it sufficient to have the social partners as
                passive consultees. They must be active participants in the
                development of policy. It is only by harnessing our collective
                energies and insight that the soundest solutions to our problems
                can be found.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The promoting social inclusion initiative and
                the work of the Economic Development Forum show the value of
                involving social partners not only in consultation, but in
                policy formation. We must consider how that can be extended as
                we consult further and, ultimately, implement the Programme for
                Government. The draft programme indicates our readiness to do
                that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As in previous years, we are also presenting
                the latest public service agreements (PSAs) for the eleven
                Departments. The PSAs will support the Executive’s priorities
                and commitments by setting out what is to be achieved from the
                Budget allocations. They reflect our commitment to openness and
                accountability to the Assembly and the public, and they focus on
                improving public services. The PSAs are in draft form, and we
                invite the Assembly and the Committees to examine them during
                the consultation period.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The draft Programme for Government is a
                manifesto for reinvestment and reform, a pledge to improve
                public services. In moving forward, our guiding principle must
                be the desire to deliver a better service to the public. We need
                to focus on delivery, on the end result and how that can be
                improved. However, as the First Minister has emphasised, it is a
                draft Programme for Government. It represents the Executive’s
                current thinking on their plans and priorities for the years
                ahead. That thinking should now be debated, discussed and, where
                necessary, challenged inside and outside the Chamber. On that
                basis, we commend the draft Programme for Government to the
                Assembly.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The draft Programme for Government is an
                impressive document, not least because it provides a
                comprehensive analysis of the problems facing Northern Ireland
                before attempting to outline solutions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Page 10 shows that unemployment has fallen
                dramatically in the past decade, although an employability issue
                remains. Chart 3 on page 11 reveals a crucial economic and
                social problem: our level of gross domestic product (GDP) per
                head continues to lag seriously behind the United Kingdom and
                European Union averages. However, one technical but significant
                point is that the chart almost certainly exaggerates the extent
                to which the Republic of Ireland’s living standard improved
                compared with that of Northern Ireland and the rest of Europe in
                the same period.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The reinvestment and reform package mentioned
                in paragraphs 3.9 to 3.12 must be a driver to deal, at last,
                with the long-standing backlog in infrastructure investment,
                which amounts to around £6 billion. By attempting to deal with
                the problem, the initiative represents an act of political
                courage and financial wisdom.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sub-priority 8 of ‘Growing as a Community’
                identifies a role for museums. I hope that they will be able to
                show what is distinctive about Northern Ireland and its history,
                while recognising the substantial east-west links with the rest
                of the United Kingdom as well as the North/ South aspect. I note
                also the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure’s proposal to
                implement an archives policy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My party is pleased that the Department of
                Culture, Arts and Leisure will provide support for implementing
                the football strategy from April next year and that new training
                facilities will be provided in at least seven sporting areas by
                March 2006.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sub-priority 1 of ‘Securing a Competitive
                Economy’, which deals with improving and developing
                infrastructure, is immensely significant for the reasons that I
                have already given, especially the backlog in investment that
                developed during the direct rule period.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That chapter’s sub-priority 2 deals with
                modernising the planning process. Hitherto, our planning process
                satisfied no one. On the one hand, developers argued that
                economic progress was held up by undue backlogs in the system.
                On the other hand, residents felt that their vital interests
                were being overridden. A general debate about planning processes
                is taking place across the UK, so Northern Ireland’s problems
                are not unique. However, some aspects are peculiar to this
                region. The Ulster Unionist Party is pleased that the planning
                process will be modernised.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Paragraph 1.5 of the document points out the
                progress and achievements made in several areas that were
                highlighted in previous Programmes for Government, including the
                expansion of higher and further education and the provision of
                free public transport for the elderly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ulster Unionist Party supports the draft
                Programme for Government in the hope that it, and future
                programmes, will support further achievements.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dallat:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The guiding principle of this draft Programme
                for Government is &quot;making a difference&quot;. Let us
                reflect for a moment on what that means and how it can be
                implemented. It means building on what the Assembly has achieved
                in the past four years. It means no return to the corruption
                that occurred during the three decades of direct rule, when
                deals were struck in smoke-filled rooms, and millions of pounds
                worth of contracts were issued without tenders, or issued to
                companies that did not tender the lowest bid.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It means a fundamental change to the Senior
                Civil Service and non-departmental public bodies. It means an
                end to the soirées and the flagrant abuse of credit cards.
                However, it means more than that: it means building on the good
                work of Seán Farren and Carmel Hanna to end the scandal whereby
                one in four people have poor levels of literacy and numeracy, so
                that everyone can hold his or her head high when applying for a
                job or seeking promotion.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am glad that the Programme for Government
                addresses also the needs of students in serious debt, who are at
                the other end of the scale. In the past four years, access to
                colleges of further education and universities has been widened
                substantially. The threshold above which parents must pay fees
                has been raised and will continue to increase as a fundamental
                principle of the SDLP. Pressure will be continued on the British
                Government for improved central funds.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will we allow those and other possibilities
                to be wiped out because a few weeping willows in the
                &quot;No&quot; camp, particularly the DUP, do not have the
                stomach to face the challenges of the future and have no
                alternatives to the Good Friday Agreement? Are we to turn our
                backs on the Health Service, which is in crisis? Are we to
                forget about our commitment to decentralisation and cross-border
                bodies, which bring untold benefits, particularly in west
                Belfast, Strabane, Derry and other unemployment black spots? I
                should think not. Those who connive behind closed doors to bring
                down the Assembly must rethink their actions. It does not seem
                to matter to them that they are creating a political vacuum,
                which gives the kiss of life to killer gangs that are long past
                their sell-by date.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The SDLP will not abandon the people to whom
                it made a firm promise in the Good Friday Agreement. We will
                fight for an extension to the free transport scheme for people
                over 60 years old. We will back our Minister of Agriculture and
                Rural Development in radically reforming the industry to secure
                the future of new and existing farmers. We will support her
                efforts to develop a new vision for agriculture, to improve
                animal health and to show the British Government that they can
                no longer treat farmers as they do. However, none of that will
                be possible if members of the Saturday morning fur-coat brigade
                continue to vote like turkeys for Christmas. The &quot;No&quot;
                campers do not give a damn about equality, social inclusion or
                unemployment black spots. <i>[Interruption].</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They seem to believe that they can turn back
                the clock to the good old days when they reigned supreme. We are
                not going back to those days: there will be no cap in hand, no
                begging bowl, and no subservience to our absentee landlords.
                Will we be left to do it alone? Those who fooled themselves at
                the weekend that they could turn the clock back should get real
                with the electorate and begin to tell them the truth. The world
                is moving on, and so are we, whether they like it or not.
                Dismantling the political structures to stop the clock is not an
                option. In a global world, and in a European context,
                partitionist politics are as dead as a dodo. Let us face the
                future together, rather than trying to lift the ball and run
                away with it. It is no longer theirs, but ours to share. If
                Armagh and Derry can do it, so can the Assembly.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having listened to the interesting statement
                of the petty comic, we should now get down to business. Do the
                First Minister and the Deputy First Minister really think that
                they can bluff the people of Northern Ireland with the documents
                that they presented today? The First Minister’s constitutional
                position is in jeopardy, and his party is stating, in the
                strongest possible manner, that things will change. We are told
                that the last date will be 18 January.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister told us that he was
                presenting his priorities for the next few years. It is quite
                interesting that an attempt is being made in this House to sweep
                the reality of the situation conveniently under the carpet and
                pretend that all is well when it is not.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As for Mr Dallat, he may have no respect for
                the electorate, but the electorate will not go away. In fact,
                the electorate or a Sinn Féin member in his own constituency
                may tell him to go away. Mr Dallat made as good a speech as any
                Shinner could have made in the days of absentee landlords and
                little fairies at the end of an Irish garden.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report says that the First Minister and
                the Deputy First Minister will apply themselves to dealing with
                the troubles, but the Deputy First Minister did not have the
                honesty to say that the trouble lies with one member of the
                Executive, an active member, who takes his seat with us. The
                Deputy First Minister did not have the honesty to say that that
                member’s party is dedicated to keeping this country in
                turmoil. It has the arms to do it, and it has been producing the
                goods.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister says that they will
                declare war on sectarian flags. I will ask him a straight
                question: does he think that the Union flag is a sectarian flag?
                Of all the flags, it has been the Union flag that has been most
                attacked and removed. Is that what he is after? The people of
                this country know what is wrong. They have a right to demand the
                right to live, the right to be free from gangsters and
                paramilitaries, from whatever side they come, and the right to
                maintain their place in a democracy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is quite amusing to hear the Deputy First
                Minister talk about equality of opportunity for all. There is no
                equality of opportunity in our new police service because of his
                party’s policy that the Roman Catholic minority must have a
                majority over Protestants. The 50% share that is given to
                Protestants must also include Jews and Hindus and everyone else.
                There cannot be equal equality of opportunity for all, yet he
                unblushingly said that that great target has been set.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This House had better realise that sooner or
                later, no matter about the dodges of the Business Committee and
                no matter about the First Minister. I read carefully a statement
                from the First Minister that said that this would not be a fudge
                but that there might be flexibility. That was a good get-out. No
                doubt, he will have to run for shelter and quote that. We are
                not running for shelter. We believe in direct confrontation with
                the electorate. Let the electorate speak.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McLaughlin:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.
                We have only had a limited opportunity to consider the draft
                Programme for Government in detail and, regrettably, even less
                opportunity to study this morning’s statement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They can only be properly considered in the
                context of the draft Budget, the content and detail of which we
                await. In the past couple of years, we have become familiar with
                the thematic content of the Programme for Government. In
                fairness, most people are content with that approach. The devil
                is in the detail. However, it is time for the Executive to
                demonstrate clearly their ability to translate the
                identification of priority areas such as health, education and
                transport into &quot;deliverables&quot;. That is how the draft
                programme and the accompanying Budget will be judged. The litmus
                test for the Executive will be their ability, or otherwise, to
                set aside party political interests and, on a truly collective
                basis, bring together and deliver on proposals for meaningful
                change that will make a tangible difference.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is ironic — some may say surreal —
                that we are being asked to consider how the Executive propose to
                make a difference when they are under a cloud and in the midst
                of the contrived crisis into which the Ulster Unionist Party is
                driving the political institutions. It is difficult to reconcile
                what appears in the draft Programme for Government with the
                general political context being shaped by those in the Ulster
                Unionist Party who are opposed to change. How do we square the
                commitment to ensuring that the transfer of political power to
                our political institutions makes a real and positive difference
                to our economic and social life with the fact that one half of
                the Executive now wants to collapse those institutions? How do
                we reconcile the commitment to tackling the underinvestment that
                is part of the legacy of direct rule with the Unionist half of
                the Executive marching down the road to nowhere? How do we
                square the Executive’s strategic objectives to achieve
                equality, partnership, sustainability and prosperity with the
                political objectives of half of the Executive, which are based
                on exclusion? How should we view the commitments contained in
                section 8 of the draft Programme for Government? Paragraph 8.4
                states:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Agreement provided a unique
                framework to develop relations within the island of
                Ireland.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yet the First Minister has declared that he
                will, with immediate effect, act in a way that will
                significantly damage those institutions. Paragraph 8.4 also says
                that the Executive will focus on</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;developing North/South relations and
                realise the potential for enhanced co-operation&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Paragraph 8.5 begins</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;We will continue to work together with
                the Irish Government to realise the full potential of enhanced
                cross-border co-operation for mutual benefit. We will take
                forward co-operation through the North/South Ministerial Council
                and in particular through the agreed areas for co-operation —
                (Agriculture; Education; Environment; Transport; Health; and
                Tourism).&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That was agreed last Thursday. Some 48 hours
                later, David Trimble contradicted that commitment. He negotiated
                and agreed with his partners on the Executive while he had in
                his pocket a proposal to wreck the all-Ireland institutions.
                When half of the Executive has adopted the policies and politics
                of the &quot;No&quot; camp, it is time for the public to ask
                questions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those are only some of the questions that
                will spring to people’s minds when they read the detail of the
                draft Programme for Government — they will think of cloud
                cuckoo land. When we debated the draft Programme for Government
                last year, it was clear that it had been developed through
                agreement between all the political parties against a backdrop
                of serious political difficulties. However, at least there was a
                collective approach. Today’s draft Programme for Government
                comes 48 hours after yet another Ulster Unionist Council meeting
                and against the backdrop of yet another Ulster Unionist Party
                threat to walk away from the institutions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us be clear: Unionists are fighting a
                concerted campaign to frustrate and delay the required changes
                to our society with regard to the equality agenda, the human
                rights agenda, the all-Ireland agenda, criminal justice,
                demilitarisation and policing. Unionists have attempted to delay
                and dilute the progress in all those areas, which are the
                cornerstones of the Good Friday Agreement. However, my greatest
                concern is whether the Executive’s Programme for Government
                will be able to deliver on the agenda for change in the light of
                the political cowardice of the Unionist political leadership.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Ministers for their statement.
                Like other Members, I received a copy of it late this morning,
                so I have not had time to read it or the draft Programme for
                Government. However, I wish to make a few comments that I will
                expand on in tomorrow’s debate.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There have been real achievements in children’s
                issues and in health matters, such as the cancer centre.
                Although I do not want to undermine those achievements, the
                Alliance Party is once again disappointed that, in the key
                themes of the draft Programme for Government, community
                relations, which will make our society more tolerant and build
                on those achievements, are not apparent. I have direct
                experience that, over the years, community relations projects
                have contributed greatly towards mutual understanding and
                tolerance, which is tragically missing in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Stronger partnerships must be built, and not
                only with local government and social partners. Sub-priority 2,
                which should have been a full priority, states:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;We recognise that we have to deal with
                the very deep and painful divisions in our society after decades
                of conflict and that we must tackle the scourge of sectarianism,
                racism and intimidation.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That sub-priority also states that elected
                and community representatives must work together. Community
                relations projects and personnel should be included in that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A community relations strategy has been
                delayed time and again, and the draft Programme for Government
                does not make it clear when, or how, the strategy will be
                announced or when the consultation process will begin. That must
                be dealt with in tomorrow’s debate. The building of a strategy
                must be a priority, together with the efficient allocation of
                resources to community relations councils to ensure that all
                citizens will benefit from their projects.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No clear account has been given of money
                allocated, and no questions have been asked about the benefits
                to the entire community. Four years after the signing of the
                Good Friday Agreement, people are still being intimidated,
                terrorised and exiled by men and women of violence who wage
                their campaigns with ease. That should not be tolerated. It is
                not solely a matter for the Executive or for the Assembly, and
                my party and I believe that sufficiently strong, decisive local
                political leadership has not been shown. That must not continue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Social inclusion, social exclusion and New
                TSN are good foundations to help disadvantaged ordinary people.
                However, those ordinary people deal with dreadful situations
                every day, and they must be supported and encouraged to come
                together in a viable and informed way. That can be done only by
                working with community relations organisations, which have their
                own confident and sustained strategy. That support and
                encouragement should be evident in all elements of the draft
                Programme for Government, which represents a manifesto for
                reinvestment and reform and a pledge to improve public services.
                I agree with those sentiments, and I have no doubt that they
                will be carried through. However, the basic safety and
                livelihoods of our people, together with their confidence, must
                be a priority.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the First Minister and the Deputy
                First Minister for their statement this morning, to which my
                main remarks have been addressed. Tomorrow I shall refer to the
                draft Programme for Government, and I look forward to the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the Unionist community views the
                proceedings today, it may be bewildered or bemused by the
                spectacle of the First Minister presenting a draft Programme for
                Government to the House. He referred to the length of time that
                it will take for the programme to come to fruition.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, in Government partnership with
                Colleagues, as they are referred to by Mr Trimble, are members
                of the Ulster Unionist Party and the Democratic Unionist Party
                who represent the Unionist community. They are, by their outward
                pleadings and statements, declaring that they recognise that the
                Unionist electorate do not support the institutions.
                Furthermore, they are exhibiting signs of nervousness as they
                approach next year’s elections.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is on that basis that Mr Trimble beats his
                chest and declares that he will not sit in a power-sharing
                Administration with Members who continue to be inextricably
                linked with those who are actively involved in terrorism.
                However, if Mr Trimble, his party and the DUP really were
                representing those who elected them to the Chamber, they would
                not sit in the Executive for one more day with those whom they
                are committed to removing. Mr Trimble will find it difficult to
                remove himself from his position because, like all his Ministers
                and those from the DUP, he is pledged under annex A, strand one,
                of the Belfast Agreement, to</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;participate with colleagues in the
                preparation of a programme for government&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is what we are here to consider today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Despite that pledge, Mr Trimble knows that he
                has no mandate, and he knows that people supported the DUP
                because it pledged to use the Assembly to bring down those
                institutions it believed to be undemocratic. Mr Trimble has now
                demonstrated that he also believes that, given the Assembly’s
                track record and the undemocratic structures that are in place,
                if he were to present his party to the electorate next year, he
                would face meltdown. However, it is only that prospective
                situation that is causing concern. There is no degree of
                recognition that those who front paramilitary private armies on
                the Republican and the Loyalist sides should not have been
                allowed to sit in government over the people whom they
                terrorised.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Trimble also stands indicted of hypocrisy
                because of his new-found realisation that he cannot sit in
                government with those who front paramilitary organisations. Of
                course, he is the same Mr Trimble who walked into the
                negotiations at Castle Buildings flanked by representatives of
                Loyalist terrorist organisations and who continues to nominate
                those people to bodies such as the Civic Forum, to which he
                recommended a person who is inextricably linked to a Loyalist
                organisation. At the same time, he has representatives on the
                Loyalist commission.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Trimble knows well that ordinary, decent
                people — Catholic, Protestant, Unionist and Nationalist — do
                not want those people to serve in the bodies and institutions.
                Also, the Secretary of State has come up with the silly notion
                of a monitor to determine whether those people are still engaged
                in acts of terrorism and intimidation and holding the
                communities to ransom. Ordinary, decent people know what is
                happening; they do not need a monitor to translate the actions
                of paramilitary organisations: they want to see an end to them.
                They want the paramilitaries on both sides put out of business.
                Mr Trimble’s problem is that, although he beats his chest and
                pretends that he has had a road to Damascus experience in
                relation to opposing terrorists in government, he continues to
                sit in government with them, putting off the day on which he
                will pull the plug on that unseemly gathering of rogues. I
                appeal to the DUP to lead the Unionists out of the Executive and
                to leave Mr Trimble isolated.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ervine:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It amazes me how hard people will work to be
                seen to be even-handed, even though everyone knows that they are
                not. I have some difficulty with the draft Programme for
                Government, and, indeed, I have some difficulty with how it was
                presented this morning. Have you noticed, Mr Deputy Speaker, how
                two parties spoke from prepared scripts, while the rest of us
                have to wing it? Two stooges stand up and tell their party
                leaders that they are wonderful. We keep falling into that trap;
                it has almost become a form of convention, and it does us no
                favours at all. The Opposition, for what they are worth, are
                small, weak and lacking cohesion. They do not even get the
                chance to have a look at what will be put in front of Members,
                and they often get only ten minutes’ notice about statements
                that will be made. The stooges with prepared scripts then come
                out. There is something inherently wrong about that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, let us move on. The First Minister
                and the Deputy First Minister said that there is a search for
                stronger partnerships. The Executive are superb role models for
                stronger partnership: we have a dysfunctional Executive talking
                about creating stronger partnership. That Executive have plunged
                themselves very quickly in the direction of PPP — perhaps soon
                to be PFI — without being remotely inventive about other
                possible options for raising finances following the
                disinvestment here caused by the Conservatives handing us their
                policies by the back door or by default.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In my constituency, 1% of children will go on
                to further and higher education, and when I read the draft
                Programme for Government I wonder how long it will take to
                destroy the iniquitous process of denying children higher
                education opportunities. I wonder when the Executive will truly
                invest the resources necessary to make a difference to those who
                live in the postal address areas that suffer discrimination
                every day, whether they are Protestant or Catholic.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the weekend debacle occurred, we saw the
                frightened offering the controls of the machinery again to the
                frightening. Instead of forging ahead with politics that might
                work by genuinely building partnerships along lines that can
                build common purpose, we saw an illusion, similar to the
                decommissioning illusion, in which we hand the throttle, the
                clutch and the brake to the paramilitaries in Northern Ireland.
                When will we learn that one should not offer the controls to the
                lowest common denominator? When will we learn that there has to
                be a way to get over our fears? That is what this is about —
                you cannot be seen to be too close to those with whom you are in
                Government, because one side will shout that you are selling
                out. Both sides play that game.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How many times have we seen one element of
                the Executive opposing the very decisions made by the Executive
                because it is popular to do so? That has happened with issues
                such as pay rises and office cost allowances. On numerous
                occasions collective decisions have been made, and individual
                Ministers have opposed them in the Chamber. Everybody wants to
                be the Opposition, rather than to take responsibility for
                decisions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are kidding ourselves about this process.
                The wording, while good in parts, is creating illusions for the
                people. There is the illusion that the Executive Ministers are
                going to deal with each other in a way that can make a
                difference; the illusion that they are going to deal with
                sectarianism and the illusion that they will deal with the crass
                and serious circumstances of poverty and disadvantage. Never has
                the community sector been so weak at a time when the Executive
                are talking about capacity building and making communities
                stronger. There are more groups scurrying about, hoping and
                begging to get some share of the funding provided by the
                Executive than ever before. We should end those illusions and
                get on with the practical work.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.15 pm</p>
                </i><b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given the decisions made at the weekend, it
                is difficult to anticipate what will happen as regards some of
                the programme’s targets, the legislative framework and our
                expenditure plans. I am full of questions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is good that the document is aspirational
                while trying to be practical. However, like David Ervine, I
                wonder where we go from here. The draft programme announces
                plans to introduce great new legislation on housing, planning
                and other issues, which people here awaited for years. Until
                now, we did not have our own Ministers and legislation to take
                account of local circumstances. The document carries a good
                message also as regards how we will provide for our children.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, Members, who are to deliver the
                programme, must ask what will happen between January and the
                Assembly election. What will happen if we do not meet the
                targets for December, as in the case of community relations?
                Will those targets go to the wall? We may not be able to deliver
                the whole programme. Let us get real.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need a contingency plan for the period
                until January, so that employers will know whether they must
                make redundancy plans for staff. The gap between the provision
                of Peace I and Peace II funding resulted in a situation similar
                to that which we are creating today: plans could not be made,
                and people could not be told what would happen in the next
                month, never mind the next three years. We must be fair by
                telling people that the targets may not be met and that they
                should continue as before rather than try to meet some of the
                programme’s objectives.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When community relations were discussed in
                the House two weeks ago, the First Minister and the Deputy First
                Minister guaranteed that they would carry out a strategy, talk
                to parties and build partnerships. Members have not even built
                partnerships in the Chamber, never mind outside it. Parties who
                wish to be involved in the development of a community relations
                strategy, including Members with experience of working at
                interface areas, still await an invitation to participate in the
                discussion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If there are plans for December 2003 — and
                I do see such a target — much work must be done to take
                account of what we did not get right and to put something
                different in place.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Major problems exist in communities, where
                the focus is mostly on paramilitary groups; however, we must
                focus also on the depoliticised, politically homeless young
                people who live there too. What kind of targets should we set?
                Two pages of targets have been set for schools; however, the
                text of the programme’s objective for youths is longer than
                the target set. The sole aim is to increase, over the next three
                years, participation in youth organisations by 2%. That is a sad
                indictment, given our communities’ problems.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Surely we could have many more imaginative
                projects and programmes, such as those listed under the targets
                for the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety.
                There should be a greater link between the projects of that
                Department and the Department of Education to help young people
                who do not attend youth clubs and who need to be involved in the
                community. Good projects and practice that are not funded should
                have been taken on board. In both its projects on educational
                disadvantage, and in its document launched last week, ‘Could
                do Better’, the Civic Forum described some such good practice
                models.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When discussing exclusion, partnership and
                sustainability, we should take a hard look at what can be
                delivered between now and January.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When I was listening to the Ministers’
                statement this morning, I was tempted to think of the ship of
                state sailing along, all sails set and loaded to the gunwales
                with goodies for the future, while, up on deck, the captain and
                his mate, the First Minister and his Deputy First Minister,
                fight over the steering wheel about which rock — be it Scylla
                or Charybdis — they will crash the ship of state on. The
                presentation was a cross between ‘Alice in Wonderland’ and a
                Brothers Grimm story. Not since Orwell’s animals decided to
                take over the farm has there been such a declaration of
                aspirations. One could hardly think of anything — apart from
                zip-fasteners on bananas and self-peeling oranges — that is
                not promised in this great document.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The truth is that there is something in what
                Mitchel McLaughlin said about the document being long on talk,
                and very short on &quot;deliverability&quot; — a word I think
                he must have got from David Ervine. Delivery is the essential
                issue: what are these people going to deliver, and how will they
                deliver it? It is said that there is a black hole of
                underinvestment of £6 billion for the next decade, but the true
                figures are probably nearer £12 billion to £15 billion. Where
                is the money going to come from? Any sensible businessman,
                taking over a company, would get his accountants to look at the
                books to check the debts and deficits, and his engineers to look
                at the equipment. Nothing of that nature was attempted by those
                who negotiated the Belfast Agreement.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This talk about running away is like a broken
                record. It comes from a man who wept in 1992 because he thought
                that he was going to be excluded from office, and that he might
                not get his sticky fingers on the levers of devolved power. I am
                very glad I ran away from that.</p>

                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister and the Deputy First
                Minister are promising all these goodies, but how are they going
                to be paid for? Perhaps they will be funded by public-private
                finance. However, those who would supply the money for that
                finance would borrow it on the market and make their profit from
                the additional interest that they would charge those who are
                going to involve themselves in a form of high-level hire
                purchase. Future generations will be burdened by repayment of
                that debt, because neither the capital nor the interest will be
                repaid out of the Barnett formula money.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Alternatively, the services may be financed
                with the new money that the First Minister and the Deputy First
                Minister are going to borrow from the British Government. Again,
                the capital will have to be repaid with interest. Where will
                they get the money to make the repayments? They will get it by
                screwing the population with a vast hike in rates, including a
                possible tap tax on water, and a possible effluent tax on
                sewage. All of this will be done to make good their inefficiency
                at the beginning.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome all the aspirations of the draft
                Programme for Government. However, the fact is that Mr Trimble
                is once again telling the canard and the untruth that Sinn Féin
                signed up to deliver decommissioning by 22 May 2000. He knows
                that it did nothing of the kind. The burden imposed upon it was
                the same as that imposed on all other parties, which was to use
                its best endeavours to bring about decommissioning by that date.
                He knows better than anyone else that Sinn Féin threatened to
                walk away from the negotiations if they were obliged to give any
                other undertakings. This is not some sort of excuse for Sinn
                Féin, whose performance has been disgraceful, and whose alleged
                decommissioning is a farce.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must tell the people the truth. We must
                stop telling them fairy tales about the future, such as those
                encapsulated in this draft Programme for Government. We must
                remind ourselves that the duty of any Assembly is to serve the
                interests of the people, and not to delude them with false
                promises that their children or grandchildren will have to pay
                for.</p>

                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Areas of special scientific interest (ASSIs)
                are the jewels in the crown of our diverse and rich landscape.
                They are special places, rich in all forms of wildlife, and
                almost 200 such areas have been declared to date. I want to see
                these sites properly safeguarded so that they can be appreciated
                by future generations. That is why I am introducing the Bill.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill meets the commitment in the
                Programme for Government to have a policy and legislative
                framework for the protection and management of ASSIs in place by
                July 2003. It will also help to address the requirements of the
                EC Directive on habitats by ensuring that Northern Ireland can
                better protect sites that, in addition to being ASSIs, have also
                merited designation under European legislation. I believe that
                the Bill will avoid the current threat of infraction proceedings
                from the European Commission and any potential fines that could
                result.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For some years my Department has been aware
                of the shortcomings in legislation pertaining to ASSIs, and
                those shortcomings were also recognised by the Assembly in the
                debate held on 23 January 2001 when there was strong support
                from all parties for better legislation. The Bill is the result
                of an extensive consultation process, which began when my
                predecessor, Mr Foster, launched the consultation paper ‘Partners
                in Protection’ on 2 March 2001.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It set out 20 key issues pertaining to the
                protection and management of ASSIs and sought public comment on
                how best to deal with those issues. Responses were received from
                a wide range of organisations with strong support for new
                legislation. On the basis of the comments received, my
                Department drew up several proposals, which were subject to a
                further round of public consultation in November last year.
                There was further strong support for those proposals, so, in
                bringing forward the Bill, we have endeavoured as fairly and
                equitably as possible and accommodate the wishes and concerns of
                all parties that contributed to the consultation process.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill replaces the existing provisions for
                ASSIs in the Nature Conservation and Amenity Lands (Northern
                Ireland) Order 1985. It builds on many of the features of the
                1985 Order, but it also incorporates the new proposals that were
                the subject of the public consultation exercise.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill has several key features. First, we
                are improving some of the procedures associated with
                declaration. For example, by allowing greater flexibility in the
                ways that amendments to site boundaries or citations can be
                introduced, we want landowners to be better informed about the
                declaration in general, so the Department will be required to
                provide a statement on how it considers the land can best be
                managed in the interests of conservation. Public bodies,
                including Departments, must also play their part. The Bill
                contains provisions that will ensure that the discharge of
                responsibilities complies with the need to conserve and enhance
                these valuable sites.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill also contains measures to ensure
                more effective protection of ASSIs, with measures to address
                damaging operations that are undertaken by owners, occupiers or
                so-called third parties and our current inability to react
                appropriately and in a timely way to these concerns. Neglect or
                inappropriate management can be equally damaging. We must be
                equipped to deal with such occurrences, which are, thankfully,
                rare.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These measures may give some people cause for
                concern, particularly those in the farming community who feel
                that they place additional burdens on them. Let me assure them
                that I do not intend that to be the case, nor do I believe that
                it will be so. The vast majority of ASSI declarations over the
                last 16 years have proceeded without difficulty. Good working
                relationships have developed between my Department and the
                farming community. My aim is to ensure that the Bill, together
                with the other measures that I will be introducing, further
                strengthens those relationships.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many of the measures contained in the Bill
                are needed for the small number of landowners who wish to carry
                out activities or operations that could irreparably damage these
                valuable sites. That is particularly important for sites whose
                importance is further recognised by designation under European
                legislation. The threat of infraction already hangs over the
                United Kingdom. The European Commission perceives that the UK
                has failed to implement fully the requirements of article 6 of
                the Habitats Directive, and the Commission has issued a reasoned
                opinion letter against the United Kingdom. Action to address
                that has already been taken in England and Wales through
                provisions in the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000,
                otherwise known as the CROW Act. The measures in the Bill will
                address the shortcomings in Northern Ireland and ward off the
                threat of infraction and potential fines.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are also safeguards built into the Bill
                for landowners, including the right of appeal to the Planning
                Appeals Commission against a decision made by the Department.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another feature of the Bill is the provision
                to ensure better management of sites. Good management of ASSIs
                is a fundamental principle of the partnership approach that we
                have fostered over the past 16 years. There are presently over
                250 management agreements in place between the Environment and
                Heritage Service and ASSI landowners or occupiers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The measures contained in the Bill create the
                right climate to encourage and support the beneficial management
                of ASSIs. They will reinforce the change to positive management
                agreements that the Environment and Heritage Service has
                introduced recently. Our consultation paper ‘Partners in
                Protection’ recognised the importance of encouraging and
                rewarding beneficial management of sites rather than merely
                preventing damage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also said that we would introduce our own
                scheme for the positive management of ASSIs. I am delighted to
                announce today that a scheme is now in place, and available to
                all landowners and occupiers in ASSIs, called &quot;MOSS&quot;,
                which stands for &quot;management of sensitive sites&quot;. It
                is an acronym that I hope everyone will find easy to remember.
                MOSS acknowledges that the wildlife value of sites is the result
                of sensitive management of the land by both past and present
                landowners. It aims to build on that by encouraging farmers and
                landowners to adopt management practices that sustain and
                enhance the special features of an ASSI. In return, landowners
                will receive payments calculated to redress income forgone. I
                appeal to all those involved in the management of land within
                ASSIs to take advantage of this important initiative, so that
                the Department, in partnership with the landowners, can further
                protect Northern Ireland’s most important wildlife sites for
                the conservation of biodiversity and the benefit of society at
                large.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, the Bill can meet the needs
                and concerns of the wide range of interested parties who are
                stakeholders in this matter. It will achieve our Programme for
                Government target for better legislation. It will also bring
                Northern Ireland into line with comparable legislation elsewhere
                in the United Kingdom, and it should also meet our EC
                obligations. The Bill strikes the right balance between the need
                for effective protection of ASSIs — sites that are vital to
                the well-being of all our diverse natural heritage — and
                allows for the continuation of established and sustainable land
                practices.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I speak especially to the more than 5,000
                ASSI landowners across Northern Ireland, who have worked in
                partnership with the Department over the last 16 years to
                safeguard those valuable conservation sites. I stress to them
                that it is my wish that that continues and is further
                strengthened. There is a need for partnership among the
                landowners and those in the Administration who give the
                protection. This Bill will help achieve that aim, and I commend
                it to the Assembly.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for the
                Environment (Rev Dr William McCrea):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for introducing the
                Bill. Given that the Committee is already scrutinising four
                substantial Bills, the Minister will understand if that thanks
                is somewhat guarded. Despite their workload, members of the
                Committee are looking forward to discussing the specific terms
                of the Bill at Committee Stage, and, therefore, I will keep my
                comments relatively short.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister will be aware that the Committee
                has already received several detailed representations on the
                consultation exercises that preceded the Bill. That demonstrates
                the importance that the Committee gives to this legislation —
                indeed, to all legislation — and the Committee’s clear
                determination to come to terms with the details of what, in many
                instances, is a complex Bill.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no doubt that legislation in respect
                of ASSIs must be updated. Although ASSIs are vital for the
                delivery of nature conservation and provide real protection for
                rare and important species of fauna and flora, as well as for
                those geological and earth science features present in Northern
                Ireland, it would be wrong to pretend that there have not been
                problems. Indeed, the Committee considered a letter at its
                meeting last week that highlighted the problems that 39
                landowners in County Tyrone were having in challenging the
                proposed designation of a huge area of land around
                Newtownstewart as an ASSI.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although the Committee will give no opinion
                on whether the proposal is right or wrong, that letter
                demonstrates quite clearly how this subject can have an impact
                on the community. However, I thank the Minister for his
                assurance to the House that it is his intention to ensure that
                there is a strengthening of the relationship between the farming
                community and his Department and that they work in partnership.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In March 2001, the Department issued an
                initial and broad-ranging consultation document called ‘Partners
                in Protection’. Following a number of presentations and
                discussions with the Department’s officials, the Committee
                made a formal response in June 2001. The Department received a
                total of 35 responses to that consultation document. To the
                Department’s credit, that paper was followed by a further
                consultation exercise in November 2001 on the specific policies
                on ASSIs that it proposed to take forward. The Committee in turn
                responded to that consultation paper in February 2002. The
                outcome of that consultation was to form the basis of the Bill
                before the House.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Committee will be particularly interested
                in how the Bill will seek to address a range of issues such as
                changes in ownership, powers to refuse potentially damaging
                operations and to make management orders and the level of fines.
                The maximum level in some circumstances in the Bill is £20,000,
                a figure that the Committee has already considered too low to
                act as an effective deterrent in two other Bills which have come
                before it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In March 2002, the Minister appeared before
                the Committee, and we discussed a proactive approach to
                co-operating with him to deal with certain Bills from his
                Department. At that time, my Committee gave assurances that it
                would co-operate fully with the Department, subject to its being
                fully satisfied with the specific terms ultimately adopted in
                the Bills. I affirm that this remains the intention of the
                Committee. However, I can assure the Minister that, as he would
                expect, it will be diligent and thorough in examining the
                details of the Bill and will come back with any amendments
                necessary at the Consideration Stage.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Carson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s statement that he
                wishes to ensure the preservation of all our important areas. To
                ensure that ASSIs are effectively managed, it is important that
                new owners or occupiers of land be made aware of any
                conservation designations in place. The Nature Conservation and
                Amenity Lands (Northern Ireland) Order 1985 could be amended to
                include a requirement that an owner or occupier notify his or
                her successor.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also welcome the Minister’s statement
                that the Department will supply each owner and occupier with a
                site management statement outlining the conservation objectives
                and indicating the appropriate management. I very much welcome
                his new MOSS designation whereby owners will receive payment,
                and I hope that owners of such sites and areas will take
                advantage of that. We must have legislation in place so that the
                Environment and Heritage Service can refuse consent for
                notifiable or potentially damaging activities. There is a gap in
                the current legislation that means that ASSIs do not afford
                protection against acts of deliberate damage by landowners or
                occupiers, and I hope that it can be plugged.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with the Chairman of the Committee
                for the Environment, Rev Dr William McCrea, that the present
                deterrents for wilful damage to ASSIs are much too lenient. I
                hope that there will be increased fines for those causing or
                permitting damaging operations and new penalties for those who
                commit intentional or reckless damage or disturbance — that
                must be covered.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I look forward to the Minister’s providing
                the Committee with some more information and to a fruitful
                completion of the next stage of the Bill.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Byrne:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My party fully appreciates the need to
                protect and conserve our natural and physical environment.
                However, the proposals, as they stand, could have a negative
                effect on the farming community and on industrial and
                residential development in rural areas, especially where ASSIs
                are sited near to villages and smaller towns.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for the
                Environment mentioned a designated ASSI in Newtownstewart in
                west Tyrone. That designated ASSI has caused great concern to
                the local community. The issues raised by the Newtownstewart
                example will have relevance to the Bill’s implementation. Many
                in the community fear that the proposed Deer Park ASSI will
                restrict landowners and farmers in the daily management and
                cultivation of their land at a time when the agriculture
                industry is experiencing serious economic difficulties.
                Furthermore, the Newtownstewart community is concerned that the
                Deer Park ASSI will restrict the land that can be used for
                industrial or residential development, mainly because the
                current proposal almost encircles Newtownstewart. It falls right
                inside the town’s inner designated limits.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of the Environment has
                acknowledged that the Deer Park ASSI includes good quality,
                productive agricultural land and areas of commercial forest, so
                it is important that the procedures by which the Department
                declares an ASSI should be revised to take into consideration
                the quality of the agricultural land that an ASSI covers. An
                ASSI can be effectively declared and preserved only if there is
                proper local consultation, so that communities can work with the
                Environment and Heritage Service to protect the agreed ASSI in
                future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once an ASSI is declared, objections must be
                made within three months. As the residents and landowners of
                Newtownstewart have found, that gives little time for concerned
                parties to make formal representations to the Department. The
                three-month time frame must be extended to allow for wider
                consultation with the community that is affected by the
                declaration of an ASSI.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the Newtownstewart case, the Department of
                the Environment has acknowledged the need to clarify and
                simplify the list of notifiable operations and those for which
                consent is not needed. The Environment and Heritage Service has,
                therefore, agreed to re-consult its statutory advisory body, the
                Council for Nature Conservation and the Countryside, on that.
                That underlines the fact that the Bill must give greater clarity
                on the matter; it must state to what extent an ASSI declaration
                will affect normal farming activities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The concept of designating carefully chosen
                ASSIs is a good thing. We should be concerned about protecting
                our natural environment, especially those parts of our region
                that have significant and special physical features. The purpose
                of the Newtownstewart ASSI is to preserve a unique glacial
                feature of that area. However, people who wish to live and work
                in rural areas must not feel that the imposition of ASSIs, as
                determined by official bodies, is a conspiracy against them to
                hinder rural-based development, whether for residential or
                farm-related business activities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s announcement of
                the MOSS initiative. That is a step in the right direction.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many concerns about the consultation process
                have been intimated to me and to others. The Minister outlined a
                consultation and appeal process. However, ASSIs have created
                much concern and interest among landowners and farmers. Will the
                Minister assure us that nothing will take place before
                consultation with landowners and farmers? People who have
                businesses in ASSIs are also concerned, especially those who own
                caravan parks.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am concerned that this designation comes
                before consultation, with the result that caravan park owners do
                not feel that they are part of the process. The caravan industry
                is geared towards leisure. Designation of ASSIs may mean that
                caravan sites, which are traditionally by the seaside and
                involve water-based activities, will be restricted. Caravan site
                owners, tenants and lessees of the caravan sites will therefore
                be unable to continue with their businesses.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the light of all the obvious concerns and
                obstacles, can the Minister assure the House that the Department
                of the Environment will adopt a cautious attitude in its
                approach to ASSI designation? Will he also assure Members that
                the views of landowners, farmers, caravan site owners and all
                those who will be affected by ASSI designation will be taken on
                board? Can the Minister also assure the House that there will be
                full, positive, transparent consultation with everyone concerned
                before any designations are made and that their views will be
                endorsed and encompassed in the Areas of Special Scientific
                Interest Bill?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Molloy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.
                I welcome the Minister’s statement. All Members welcome the
                idea of good legislation to deal with the protection of
                heritage. However, I share the caution of other Members. The
                farming community, in particular, should have been consulted
                with, listened to and provided with relevant information.
                Farmers in my area feel that they have not been involved and
                that some of the earlier designations have been made with little
                or no consultation. People feel that the designation of ASSIs
                are being imposed on the countryside. The Bill mentions
                &quot;owners&quot;, but people feel that they own very little
                land when the Department decides that it wants to do something
                with it: the Department makes the decision and the farmer faces
                the consequences.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although designation can cause the
                devaluation of an area, adequate compensation has not been
                provided. That has been the case in the Cookstown/Kildress area
                where sand extraction has taken place over recent years. It is
                an area rich in sand deposits, and the rest of the country has
                benefited from that in the past. However, because of farm
                diversification, that area is a honeypot for people to develop
                and expand a business, and a small area of conservation in the
                middle of it can be detrimental to those trying to develop it.
                If it is only a small area, the rest of the land can be
                landlocked, with damaging effect on the area to be preserved.
                Therefore, Members must look at the nature and purpose of the
                conservation and consider what they want to see the Bill develop
                and protect.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clause 1(1) mentions the consultation between
                the Department of the Environment and the Council for Nature
                Conservation and the Countryside. Consultation must be wider
                than that. There must be proper consultation with farmers and
                the entire rural population. If policies are to be implemented
                to bring about ruralisation, and rural proofing, as the Minister
                of Agriculture mentioned, informative consultation must take
                place. It is hoped that the ASSIs will be properly managed.
                Members must also look at farm diversification and bear in mind
                that farmers in some areas do not have any other means of
                support.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Environment and Heritage Service played
                an important role in the drafting of the Bill, but decisions
                should be made in partnership with the farming community.
                Decisions should not be imposed on the farming or rural
                community as they have been in the past. With some exceptions,
                the rural community has been the best protector of heritage. If
                you point out the special nature that you are trying to
                preserve, people will work in partnership with you. It is to be
                hoped that the measures in the Bill will be used in the proper
                manner and that decisions will not simply be imposed from the
                top.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue of right of appeal is also
                important. Those who want to pursue the right of appeal should
                have proper access and be given support. There should also be a
                back-up service to ensure that people get a fair hearing. In the
                past, too many tribunals have merely been about people making
                representations, while Government Departments have all the
                legislation and legal and administrative back-up to ensure that
                it is they who succeed. Those who want to appeal decisions need
                support to ensure that they have all the information. I welcome
                the opportunity for further discussion in the Committee and for
                debate in the House.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCarthy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I give a general welcome to the Bill, but it
                is a disgrace that Northern Ireland is so far behind Europe and
                the rest of the UK in implementing environmental Directives. The
                Bill is overdue, and the Alliance Party is keen for it to be
                placed on the statute book as soon as possible. Other Members
                have spoken about consultations — that is the name of the
                game. However, the Department has failed dismally to consult
                properly with landowners and farmers. Some years ago Strangford
                Lough was designated as an ASSI. There was almost a revolt
                because landowners were not given the correct information and
                were being dictated to by the Department. There was a similar
                situation last year when Grey Point to Ballyquintin Point in
                Portaferry was to be designated as an ASSI. There were, again,
                lapses, despite my representation to the Department at a meeting
                of Ards Borough Council to ensure that consultation was the name
                of the game.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. Dr McDonnell, it is extremely
                discourteous to turn your back to Mr McCarthy and continue a
                conversation when he is on his feet.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCarthy:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some landowners were informed only by second
                or third parties, and that does not help the process. Everyone
                must get involved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Alliance Party also welcomes the
                requirement for the Department of the Environment to provide a
                statement on the management of the land as stated in clause
                1(2). That should be of major benefit to the owner/ occupier of
                the land as well as improve conservation. Another important
                point is the provision for management agreements, as stated in
                clause 7, which includes costs being met by the Department. It
                is wrong that many landowners who care for valuable natural
                sites do so at their own cost. We also welcome clauses 11 to 13
                with regard to the statutory duty on public bodies to promote
                conservation. However, in some respects, it is less robust than
                the requirements on private owners.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In paragraph 19 of the explanatory and
                financial memorandum &quot;modest additional resources&quot; are
                mentioned, yet the Bill provides for management agreements and
                payments where consent is withdrawn. Paragraph 2(2) of schedule
                1 requires a full management declaration, as in clause 1, for
                all existing ASSIs within five years. Can the Minister assure us
                that this can be done with &quot;modest additional
                resources&quot;?</p>

                especially with regard to the management of sensitive sites.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am concerned that many people who live in
                sensitive areas do not want to sign up to the MOSS scheme. What
                is their situation under the legislation?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I urge the Minister and his Department to be
                careful and to try not to force the issue. As Mr Molloy said, if
                the Department consults with the farmers it will find that they
                are sensitive to what happens in their areas. No one knows more
                about the issue than the farmers because they live in the rural
                areas. Although they understand what the Department is trying to
                do, they will not be pushed into doing something that they do
                not want to do.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that consultation takes place. The
                Department must understand that it is entering into a
                partnership with the farming community. The last thing that
                farmers want is to have people turning up on their premises
                telling them what to do. I am not suggesting that the Minister
                will take that sort of attitude. However, as a farmer, I know
                that they will consult the Department if asked to do so. We are
                talking about a working relationship that will survive only if
                both partners work together.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many issues affect rural areas at present,
                and agriculture has been going through a difficult patch. All
                those issues now come together. We must introduce a Bill that
                will protect the farmer as well as the sensitive sites, and that
                will take on board good farming practices. We are entering into
                an arrangement that will work, and, provided there is goodwill,
                it will survive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister must take all the issues on
                board. For example, he must address matters such as the farmers
                who do not want to have people tramping over their land.
                However, if there is a will, there is a way to address the
                issues, and I wish him success.</p>

                and Amenity Lands (Northern Ireland) Order 1985, because it was

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In many respects, the Assembly passes some
                types of legislation because it has no choice. The Countryside
                and Rights of Way Act 2000 covers England, Scotland and Wales
                and has greatly strengthened sites of special scientific
                interest (SSSI) legislation. We must introduce similar
                legislation in this part of the United Kingdom in the interests
                of parity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is also the matter of European
                legislation. We are signatories to many international
                conventions, such as the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, the Bonn
                Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species and European
                Directives on special areas of conservation and special
                protection areas for birds. There is a panoply of legislation
                and European Conventions. As part of the European Community, we
                are duty-bound to implement legislation that will protect such
                areas whether we like it or not.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the Minister stated, the European
                Community is concerned that the United Kingdom is not doing all
                that it can to conserve habitats. A European Union policy,
                Nature Europa, obliges member states to designate areas
                representative of nature conservation among the top European
                sites. The Irish Republic and, to a lesser extent, Northern
                Ireland are a fair bit behind in meeting their obligations under
                that policy. It is in that context that the Minister finds
                himself having to amend and update legislation on ASSIs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a civilised, western industrialised
                nation, we would be hypocritical were we to criticise the
                Indians of the rainforests or the tribes of Africa for
                destroying their habitats and important wildlife areas if we
                have not put our own house in order. The main mechanism that we
                have to protect our environment is ASSI designation, which is
                important for nature conservation. That is particularly relevant
                because we do not have national parks as in Canada or the United
                States. That being the case, it is incumbent upon us not only to
                designate all the areas that meet the standard but also to
                ensure that they are adequately protected. The proposals go a
                long way to achieve that, particularly in dealing with
                third-party damage. In my constituency of South Down, ASSIs have
                been damaged not by the owner or occupier but by fly-tippers who
                damage sites without the consent of the landowner.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A point that has been overlooked in the
                Minister’s statement and which deserves a fair hearing is the
                MOSS proposals. They propose grant aid for farmers and other
                landowners to assist them in the management of ASSIs. That is
                positive, because we all know farmers’ desperate situation.
                Their incomes are at an all time low, and anything that provides
                more money for them is to be welcomed. It will change people’s
                perception of ASSIs. Instead of regarding ASSIs as negative and
                restrictive, farmers could see them as an opportunity to reach
                management agreements with the Department to work together with
                the Environment and Heritage Service to manage these important
                areas and to bring in much needed income. Some farmers would
                rather have the positive income that MOSS provides than lose
                perhaps £15 for every sheep they produce.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCarthy, Dr Birnie and other Members must
                remember that ASSIs cover only 6% of Northern Ireland. Even when
                all the sites have been designated, they will probably still
                cover less than 10%. Therefore 90% of the Province could be
                farmed in the normal way without any restriction.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is worth having the special designation,
                but it is more important to have the funding to reach the
                agreements. I hope that sufficient finances are made available
                to the Department of the Environment so that the agreements can
                become widespread and positive. His constituents might even
                plead with Mr McCarthy to have their land designated as areas of
                special scientific interest so that they can avail of the
                funding.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Strangford Lough is in the constituencies of
                Strangford and South Down. There was much opposition to
                designating Strangford Lough as an ASSI. However, there has been
                little mention of it in the past three or four years, as
                landowners have realised that it is not the bogeyman that they
                assumed — it is positive. We owe it to future generations to
                preserve the 6% or 8% of the best of our nature conservation
                habitats in Northern Ireland so that they can enjoy these
                wonderful areas.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of the Environment (Mr Nesbitt):</b>
                I thank Mr Wells for his beautiful words of help for me. He was
                not in the Chamber when I said that I look for assistance
                because I have the cold. I shudder to think what assistance he
                would have given me if he had heard me ask. Nonetheless, he
                spoke some wonderful words of support for what I am trying to
                do.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank all Members for their contributions
                and for their interest. Mr McCarthy and Mr Savage gave the
                farming point of view. We heard from Mr Shannon, and Jim Wells
                made a genuine point about the opportunity to protect our
                habitat. I will respond to some of the comments made. The
                departmental officials will scrutinise Hansard, and any of the
                detailed questions that have not been answered will be addressed
                in due course.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Rev Dr William McCrea for his
                comments. The legislation requires updating. I entirely agree
                that it would be wrong to pretend that there are no problems —
                this very debate has shown that there are. I note the letter he
                mentioned from 39 landowners. The Member welcomed, as Mr Savage
                did, the strengthening of the relationship between the
                Department, in administrating ASSIs, and the farming and
                landowning community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will answer three of Rev Dr William McCrea’s
                points. He mentioned powers of refusal. The Department will have
                entry powers and power to refuse consent for operations that
                would damage special features of ASSIs. The Department will also
                issue management notices that will address neglect. That may be
                viewed as a stick, but it satisfactorily complies with human
                rights legislation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill provides for an appeal mechanism for
                the various aspects where the Department has authority. We must
                ensure that the powers are not abused, but we, as the public
                sector custodian, must also have the appeal mechanism and be
                seen to be using it correctly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr William McCrea mentioned management
                notices. We want a theme of agreement and partnership. We want
                to exhaust all possibilities in trying to seek agreement between
                those who must work the land and those who want to designate an
                ASSI. The safeguard of the right of appeal remains available if
                we do not get it quite right.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member also mentioned that the maximum
                level of fines in some cases in the Bill is £20,000. However,
                as the Member has said before, fines in other Bills have been
                higher. There is now a parallel. Where a maximum fine was
                £5,000, it has been brought up to £20,000. A fine of £30,000,
                which would reflect inflation, has been suggested. We are
                conscious of that and have been negotiating on it. I also remind
                the House that that is the figure in the lower court.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As projected under another Bill that the
                Environment Committee and the Department are considering, there
                are unlimited fines in the higher court. That will take care of
                the fines aspect, but I take the Member’s points about the
                £20,000 fine versus the £5,000 and the £30,000 fine, which
                features in another Bill.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We want fines to be an appropriate deterrent.
                Like the Chairperson of the Environment Committee, we believe
                that the current fine is an inappropriate deterrent. That
                answers Mrs Carson’s point about increasing fines.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Byrne mentioned the negative impact on the
                farming community. He mentioned the deer park at Newtownstewart.
                I do not want to address that specific area now, so my officials
                will address it directly with the Member. I have often said that
                the farming element is important. Mr Savage said that he is a
                farmer. I said that I come from a farming background. I
                empathise with farming and farmers. There are farmers in my
                family and in my constituency. Therefore, I try to empathise and
                understand the points raised by the farming community.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We do not want to place unnecessary burdens
                on the farming community. Many of the 5,000 people who own the
                200 ASSIs are from the farming community, and we need their
                co-operation. The vast majority of owners work well with us —
                there are exceptions, but we try to deal with them. Mr Wells
                said that not enough attention had been paid to the management
                of sensitive sites. Again, I thank him for raising that point. I
                see from Mr Wells’s facial expression that he is concerned by
                the fact that I am commending him again.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wells:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It might be in the papers.</p>
                <b>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It might well be in the papers. However, it
                must be noted that I am commending him for commending me.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is even worse.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Nesbitt:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is true.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We will offer payments in return for managing
                land, and for the purpose of conservation. Thus we hope to give
                landowners the satisfaction they need. The Bill will provide for
                the compensation, through management agreements, of landowners
                who are unable to continue certain activities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We do not want another management scheme —
                that is provided for in existing legislation. We would prefer to
                have an agreement, but, if we cannot do so, we will use
                management notices, which could be viewed as &quot;the
                stick&quot;. We prefer to work in partnership, and it is
                essential that we do so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon urged caution and sought assurance
                that nothing would take place until there had been further
                discussion. We recognise that we must work in partnership with
                those who manage the ASSIs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Molloy mentioned sand deposits and farm
                diversification, which we must examine to see how they can fit
                in with ASSIs. If land were not part of an ASSI, what would the
                farming community do with it? In economic terms, what would be
                the opportunity cost? What would be lost if land were designated
                as an ASSI? That opportunity cost needs to be considered when
                making decisions about compensation. Mr Molloy warned that
                decisions should not be imposed on the farming community. I have
                tried to convey the message that we do not wish to impose from
                the top. I disagree with Mr McCarthy’s remark that the
                Department failed dismally to consult with farmers and
                landowners.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCarthy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes, dismally.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Nesbitt:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Two full consultations were carried out, and
                we tried to reflect their outcome in the Bill. The Bill will go
                to the Committee Stage, which will involve further consultation
                and deliberation, before it comes back to the Assembly. We will
                try to consult and work in partnership with those who will be
                affected by the Bill.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I apologise for not catching all of Mr
                McCarthy’s point about resource implications. We have
                sufficient resources to start the implementation work set out in
                the new legislation, partly because of the recruitment of
                additional staff, as provided for through the spending review of
                the Budget 2000-01. Of course, when resources are not available,
                I will bid for additional resources to ensure the fullest
                implementation of the work. However, to place a bid is not to
                guarantee its success. I can but hope, and shall wait to see how
                the spending rounds go.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The final contributors, Mr Savage and Mr
                Wells, encapsulated what I had already said. At the beginning of
                my winding-up remarks, I mentioned tension. Mr Savage spoke of
                partnership, saying that telling farmers what to do would not
                work. Both parties must work together. No one tells the farmers
                in my family what to do; instead, they should be asked to work
                together to get things done.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wells spoke of the &quot;panoply of
                European Union legislation and conventions&quot;. It is our
                bounden duty — like it or not — to implement those. European
                Union Directives to protect the environment cannot be
                disregarded, otherwise we face infraction proceedings. The Bill
                takes account of the legal imperative, of European Union
                desires, and the need for partnership with the community in
                creating areas of special scientific interest. The Bill will
                bring Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the United
                Kingdom. I hope that it will be fair to all the interests
                involved, to those who seek further measures to safeguard the
                natural heritage, to what EU Directives require of us, and to
                the owners and occupiers of the land, who continue to use it in
                a sustainable manner. I hope that it will be fair to the
                community as a whole, whether land-users or users of those areas
                of special scientific interest that need protection.</p>

                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I express my appreciation to Dr Birnie and
                the Committee for Employment and Learning for considering the
                Regulations so promptly. I regret the short time available to
                the Committee, but, once policy had been settled as to how best
                transpose European Council Directive 1999/70/EC concerning the
                framework agreement on fixed-term work in the UK, my officials
                had little time to process the Northern Ireland draft
                Regulations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fixed-term Regulations will implement
                European Council Directive 1999/70/EC concerning the framework
                agreement on fixed-term work. They will also prevent pay and
                pensions discrimination against fixed-term employees. Most
                statutory employment rights already protect employees on
                fixed-term contracts. Part-time workers, however, enjoy
                additional protection from being less favourably treated than
                comparable full-time workers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The new fixed-term Regulations have been
                designed to give similar rights to fixed-term employees by
                ensuring that, because of the nature of their contracts, they
                are not treated less favourably than comparable permanent
                employees, unless that treatment can be objectively justified.
                In short, the Regulations’ key aims are to prevent
                discrimination against fixed-term employees and to place a limit
                on the use of successive fixed-term contracts to prevent abuses
                arising from their use. Fixed-term employees will be able to
                compare their conditions with those of employees who are not on
                fixed-term contracts and are employed by the same employer to do
                the same, or broadly the same, work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I realise that there may be occasions when
                employers may have objective reasons for treating a fixed-term
                employee differently from a similar permanent employee, and the
                Regulations provide for that. In particular, they state that
                different treatment is objectively justified, providing the
                fixed-term employee’s overall package of conditions is not
                less favourable than those of a comparable permanent employee.
                Employers will not, therefore, be prevented from giving a
                fixed-term employee a higher salary to compensate for their not
                having other benefits, such as access to a pension scheme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A core aim of the EC Directive is that member
                states take measures to prevent the abuse of successive
                fixed-term contracts. The Regulations aim to achieve that by
                limiting the use of successive fixed-term contracts to four
                years, unless the use of further fixed-term contracts is
                justified on objective grounds. For the purposes of that area of
                the Regulations, service accumulated from 10 July 2002 will
                count towards the four-year limit.</p>

                in our joint private office, including our private secretaries,
                special advisers and administrative support as well as a team
                that handles the large volume of correspondence that we receive.</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our Department has a wide range of functions
                that have been conferred on it by statute or that have been
                added by the Assembly from time to time. The Department’s
                responsibilities go far beyond those of the Prime Minister’s
                office or that of the Taoiseach. Our Department has a unique
                role and remit, covering equality and community relations
                policies and programmes, economic policy and European matters.
                It also supports the Executive as a whole and, indeed, supports
                and facilitates the work of the full range of Departments and
                Ministers. That is clearly shown in relation to the North/South
                Ministerial Council, the British-Irish Council, the work of the
                Executive secretariat, the Economic Policy Unit and the
                Executive information service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On 2 September, 417 staff were in post in the
                Department. Some 383 are directly engaged in the Department’s
                work, and the remainder are posted to those independent bodies
                for which the Department is responsible for providing staffing
                support, such as the Planning Appeals Commission and the
                International Fund for Ireland. A more detailed summary has been

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would appear from the Deputy First
                Minister’s answer — and I invite him to agree — that the
                number of staff employed means that the people of Northern
                Ireland are getting value for money. The staff are targeted,
                deal effectively and efficiently with their work and are by no
                means disproportionate to the needs of the First Minister and
                the Deputy First Minister.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee of the
                Centre has called for more resources for the Department. Would
                the Deputy First Minister like to comment on that?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member is correct that the Chairperson of
                the Committee of the Centre has made the point on several
                occasions that insufficient resources are being committed to the
                OFMDFM. He has made that point in relation to e-government and
                European policy matters. Indeed, the Committee of the Centre
                observed in a report that more staff and financial resources are
                necessary.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must also remember that some people who
                work in OFMDFM are working on, for example, the review of public
                administration. Many of those people have been brought in from
                elsewhere in the public service and will be on our payroll only
                for the duration of that review.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People misunderstand the comparisons made
                about OFMDFM, the Taoiseach’s office and Downing Street. A
                fair comparison might be made between the central co-ordination
                functions of OFMDFM and the Cabinet Office, which has a staff of
                more than 2,000. The Equality Unit and a range of other services
                have to be provided for somewhere in the Government, and the
                Assembly agreed that they would be assigned to OFMDFM.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Robert Coulter:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Would OFMDFM’s responsibility for functions
                beyond central co-ordination be better sited elsewhere, leaving
                a leaner, slimmer Department to discharge its primary
                all-important function of co-ordinating Government?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The composition of Departments and the
                distribution of their functions are determined by the Assembly,
                having been proposed by the First Minister and the Deputy First
                Minister. When departmental functions are reviewed, it is
                conceivable that some responsibilities that are currently in the
                remit of OFMDFM could be reassigned to other Departments.
                However, some OFMDFM functions support the Executive as well as
                the work of Departments and their impact on other bodies such as
                the North/South Ministerial Council and the British-Irish
                Council. The Executive are working not only to support the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister but to facilitate the
                work of all Ministers and Departments. Some units lend
                themselves naturally to central office, such as OFMDFM’s role
                in providing Executive support, while units that deal with other
                Government work or specialist areas could be considered for
                reassignment. However, those units and functions will not
                disappear: many existed before the creation of OFMDFM; some,
                such as the Equality Unit, are new and required new resources
                and commitments. Many Members have pointed out that such areas
                require more finance and additional personnel.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr S Wilson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will be surprised by the Deputy First

                creation of jobs for David Trimble’s cronies and on UUP
                election failures.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is the Deputy First Minister aware of panic
                in the OFMDFM as staff frantically search through the jobs
                columns of newspapers at the prospect of being out of work by 18
                January 2003, as the First Minister yet again gets tough on the
                IRA? Or have OFMDFM’s employees taken the same cynical view as
                the rest of the population with regard to another deadline —
                yet again given before an election — which is never carried
                through? That deadline will go the same way as the deadlines
                given before the Assembly elections, the local council elections
                and the Westminster elections.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The staff of OFMDFM and the relevant pay and
                rations bill, involves many civil servants. The Member refers to
                a budget of £13 million and suggests that it is connected to
                cronies of either the First Minister or the Deputy First
                Minister. That suggestion is entirely misplaced. The majority of
                jobs in OFMDFM existed before the establishment of that
                Department; it was a matter of which Department those jobs would
                be located in. The setting up of the Executive, new structures
                and equality responsibilities meant that new jobs had to be
                created, which had to be assigned somewhere. There is an
                argument for a dedicated Equality Unit, which would require many
                staff. The issue should be treated fairly. Today in OFMDFM

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With your permission, Mr Speaker, I will take
                questions 4 and 9 together. There have been several informal
                discussions between Ministers and the chairman of the Policing
                Board on the location of the police training college. We are
                aware of the board’s interest in the Maze site. However, our
                use of that site is subject to the terms of our agreement with
                the Treasury, which cover all the sites to be transferred to the
                Executive, free of charge, under our reinvestment and reform
                initiative. Those terms include an undertaking on our part to
                plan the development of each site strategically, with a view to
                maximising the benefit of the economic and social regeneration
                of local communities. To this end, members of the reinvestment
                and reform initiative project board have recently visited all
                the sites, and we look forward to receiving their advice. In the
                specific case of the important site at the Maze, we must also
                take into account proposals for the development of the adjacent
                Ministry of Defence site at Long Kesh. As far as I am aware,
                there have been no discussions with the chairman of the Policing
                Board on any other matter.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Paisley Jnr:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister deliberately failed to
                answer the part of the question that interests most people. Does
                he support the proposal to locate a new police training college
                at the Maze site? That is critical, given that his party
                unanimously endorsed that position at a Policing Board meeting.
                Is it the case that, at a meeting over the summer months with
                the chairman of the Policing Board, he suggested that the Maze
                site was worth £1 million per acre and that, as a result, he
                could not justify giving that land to the board? Does he now
                stand as the impediment to progress in the creation of a
                first-class, twenty-first century training college for police
                officers in Northern Ireland? Will he now commit himself to
                locating a police college at that site?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am afraid that, yet again, Junior is
                misinformed. I have had no meeting with the chairman of the
                Policing Board. There was a telephone conversation. I did not
                make the comment that he attributed to me. I do not know who may
                have said it, but I certainly did not, and I do not know where
                that invention came from.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I refer the Member to my original answer. The
                Maze site was transferred to us free of charge. If the Member
                thinks about that for a moment, he will realise the enormous
                problems we would face if we subsequently transferred to the
                Northern Ireland Office property that was given to us free and
                for a purpose. Clear conditions are attached to the use of the
                property. We would experience considerable difficulties with the
                Treasury if we departed from them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a further factor to be considered.
                The total area, including not only the Maze site, but the
                Ministry of Defence property, amounts to more than 300 acres.
                The site is centrally located at a strategic point in Northern
                Ireland. It is clearly irresponsible to deal with this in a
                piecemeal manner without considering how to maximise the benefit
                in the broader sense, not only financially, but socially, for
                Northern Ireland as a whole. I would have thought that the
                Member’s colleague in the Department for Regional Development
                would want to reconsider strategic plans in view of the
                significance of this site rather than fritter the opportunity
                away. Of course we want to see a first-class police college
                there, but the Member should be more responsible and not propose
                to squander significant assets in such a way.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister made a very convincing
                argument for placing the police college at the Maze site. It is
                strategically placed, in a central location, and there is an
                abundance of land. Those are all good reasons to support
                locating a police college there. Is Mr Trimble saying that he is
                opposed to setting up a police college on a central site? People
                want more police officers on the streets, and his office is
                holding back better policing by delaying the opportunity to
                develop a police college.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The reason for the delay in establishing a
                new police college, one of the few proposals in the Patten
                Report that we favoured, is the Treasury’s failure to provide
                the appropriate finance. That is a reserved matter for the
                Northern Ireland Office. I support plans for a first-class
                police college, but its provision is a matter for the Northern
                Ireland Office and the Policing Board. Many sites in Northern
                Ireland could be considered. Mr Poots might wish to seek the
                views of his constituents in the Maze area.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister must find it at least
                ironic, and at worst contradictory, to answer a question on a
                site for a new police training college two days after he
                threatened the Police (Northern Ireland) (Amendment) Order 2001,
                to which his party Colleagues on the Policing Board contributed.
                Is the Policing Board seeking to use the Maze Prison site, the
                Ministry of Defence site, or both?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am sure that Ms Lewsley is very glad that
                on Saturday we managed to save the agreement, to give it another
                chance to succeed and to prevent it from collapsing, which it
                otherwise would have done. We need to put that in context.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In response to Ms Lewsley’s question, we
                have only the Policing Board’s press release to go on. The
                board stated that the new police training college could be
                located on the Maze site, and it made reference to &quot;the
                extensive site at the former prison&quot;. No reference was made
                to the adjacent Ministry of Defence site at Long Kesh. Any use
                of part of the Maze site would have to take account of the whole
                area. The Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First
                Minister has not made a decision on the matter because it is
                unable to do so. However, we have asked the reform and
                reinvestment initiative project board for its advice, and we
                think that the matter should be considered strategically.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In December 2001, the North/South Ministerial
                Council agreed that a working group should be set up to consider
                the arrangements to give effect to paragraph 17 of strand two of
                the agreement. Three meetings of the working group, which on the
                Northern Ireland side were led by the EPCU, have now taken
                place, and the North/South Ministerial Council has endorsed a
                progress report. That commits each sector to consider at its
                next ministerial meeting whether any EU issues require
                attention, and an assessment will be given at the next plenary

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the First Minister agree that the
                actions of paramilitaries, both Loyalist and Republican, are
                fomenting community conflicts and have undermined efforts to
                improve community relations in both interface areas and the
                wider community? Has he highlighted to the Northern Ireland
                Office the adverse effects that paramilitary actions have had on
                community relations and on public confidence in the democratic
                process?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There appears to be significant evidence to
                indicate that community division, particularly in interface
                areas, is now greater than it has been at any point in the last
                quarter of a century. The deterioration of the position, which
                is contrary to what one would have expected subsequent to the
                agreement, is wholly attributable to the actions of Loyalist and
                Republican paramilitaries at those interfaces. There is no doubt
                that the conflict that we have seen at interfaces during the
                summer has had a dramatic impact on community confidence; that
                is true to such an extent that as a result of the behaviour of
                paramilitaries, the future is not good, and these institutions
                are at risk.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since the launch of the review of public
                administration on 24 June, the review team has made significant
                progress. An initial pre-consultation process with a range of
                stakeholders began in late August and will conclude on 11
                October 2002. That involves more than 60 meetings with
                representatives of local government, public bodies, health
                bodies, education bodies, the Civic Forum, organisations that
                look after the interests of public sector staff, the community
                and voluntary sector, rural interests, political parties and the
                business sector, et cetera. It is a listening exercise that will
                help to inform the development of a formal consultation document
                that will be published later this year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The team has initiated a major programme of
                research. During the summer it commissioned several briefing
                papers on topics such as accountability, public sector reform
                and subsidiarity. Those papers will be made available to the
                public on the review team’s web site by the end of the month.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other elements of the research programme
                include a major exercise to map the public sector, attitudinal
                work and focus groups.</p>

                aspects of the pre-consultation process. However, when does he
                plan to implement the more public aspects of the consultation,
                as it is important that we get to that point as soon as
                possible? Many people who are not members of the bodies to which
                the Deputy First Minister referred may want to have an input.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I have said, the team is already meeting
                with a range of stakeholders. It is conscious of the need for
                meaningful engagement with the end-users of public services and,
                along with a panel of experts, is actively considering the best
                way to carry that out at each stage of the review. At this early
                stage, the team is gathering initial public views through the
                Northern Ireland Omnibus Survey and through the establishment of
                a focus group project. The formal consultation will then be
                drafted on the basis of those initial soundings, and that should
                proceed on the timetable that was outlined when the review was
                launched in June.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In my statement to the Assembly on 25 June
                2002, I called for a commitment from the Irish Football
                Association (IFA) to sign up to a package of measures consistent
                with the recommendations contained in the advisory panel’s
                report, published in October 2001. Since then the IFA, with
                support from the Sports Council for Northern Ireland and in
                consultation with others, has been working on the preparation of
                a long-term development plan for the game. I understand that the
                plan was discussed by the IFA council on Monday 16 September
                2002. I have not yet seen a copy of the development plan but
                look forward to seeing one in the very near future. Subject to
                the time frame contained in the IFA’s development plan, I
                anticipate that implementation will take place over the next
                five to 10 years.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr McDonnell:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I know that we cannot second-guess or
                pre-empt the plan, but, if the Minister hopes to see it
                implemented over a five- to 10-year period, could he give us
                some flavour of what general progress and advances he would hope
                to make?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The progress which we hope to make is the
                development and advancement of the game. A key thing that the
                development plan must have is the backing of the wider football
                community. There must be opportunities and benefits for all
                levels of football. It is not simply about the international
                team or senior football but the sport at all levels right down
                to the grass roots, including boys’ and women’s soccer and
                disability sports. It is essential that it be based on
                fundamental principles of fairness, inclusiveness,
                accountability, leadership and transparency. That is the goal
                and the vision that we seek. The advisory panel published 150
                recommendations. When I finally get the IFA’s plan, I shall
                carefully examine it to see the correlation with our own
                strategy; I hope that there will be a very close match. If there
                is not a close match, I shall have to consider the next step.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister has confirmed that there has
                been a delay on the part of the IFA in responding to the
                football strategy. Given that delay, does he feel that the
                football strategy can still be delivered in the reduced
                timescale and within the lifetime of this Assembly?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The strategic plan outlined by the panel
                looks far into the future for implementation. Time is getting
                short for an IFA decision to support the strategy, and the
                Member is quite right to point to the fact that the lifetime of
                this Assembly is drawing to a close. I asked the IFA to give me
                a response by September. I understand from press reports that it
                now has a development plan, but it has not yet given it to me. I
                have not seen it; the Department has not seen it. I should have
                thought that I might have received it by now. I look forward to
                getting it, at which time I shall carefully scrutinise it. I
                shall probably also return to the original panel to seek its
                advice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the key things that I shall be seeking
                is support from the wider football family. Only if the entire
                football family in Northern Ireland is prepared to back the
                strategy can we make it work.</p>

                and drive he has shown in his football strategy, which contains
                a great many good and meaningful measures, I trust that the
                small junior football clubs will not be forgotten in any way,
                enabling them to survive and so provide encouragement and decent
                facilities for junior footballers. Such clubs are the heartbeat
                of soccer throughout Northern Ireland; their survival is vital
                for football in general to succeed.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I endorse what Mr Foster has said about
                junior soccer. As I said in my answer to Dr McDonnell, I see the
                strategy including the entire football family, with a strong
                concentration on youth, and on the junior and grass-roots levels
                as well as the senior game. A sum of £1·6 million has already
                been made available for youth development, which will provide
                opportunities for the development of centres of excellence.
                Nineteen centres have already been announced; there are four
                more to come, making a total of 23. That shows our desire to
                concentrate on the grass roots and develop the game not from the

                funded the purchase of the site, and a project board has been
                set up. The Department approved the outline business case in
                February 2001, and a PFI procurement process was initiated. That
                process is currently at stage 10 of the 14 stages of the
                process. I did not design the PFI process. It was appropriate

                will take place in 2003 and 2004 for Dunmurry and Moira
                respectively. Those are the next two steps that the board is

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have been aware for some time of the
                problems facing soccer and the need to upgrade many sports
                stadia, especially soccer stadia, in Northern Ireland to modern
                standards. I have already taken steps to address some of the
                problems through the interim safe sports grounds scheme, but
                this proposal prioritises safety issues. Against that
                background, I welcome the news that some local football clubs
                are beginning to negotiate partnerships with local authorities
                and the private sector, not only to develop more modern stadia
                but to make them more commercially viable.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hilditch:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister agree that, to date, the
                refurbishment of sports grounds has only been a sticking-plaster
                job and has not been successful, even though it has dealt with
                health and safety? With new interest, especially from the
                private sector, does the Minister agree that there is a need to
                review the funding provided through the safe sports grounds
                scheme?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not agree that the refurbishment
                programme is a &quot;sticking-plaster job&quot;. The Executive
                have devoted £6 million to sports grounds in the past two and a
                half years. That indicates the support that major sports grounds
                receive — and, I hope, will continue to receive — from the
                Executive. That money has been spread across several sports such
                as soccer, Gaelic football and rugby.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important that those involved in
                football look beyond receiving a Government handout and a
                Government cheque. That is why I welcome the moves that some
                soccer clubs are making to find private support and sponsorship,
                and local authority support. Ballymena United is a prime example
                of partnership between a football club and its local authority.
                Bangor FC is looking at a possible partnership with North Down
                Borough Council to obtain land for a football stadium, and Ards
                Borough Council has given a portion of land to allow Ards FC to
                build a new Castlereagh Park. Those are the types of steps that
                must be taken.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problem will not be solved by Members
                coming to the Chamber and asking for money. Resources are
                scarce, and money should come from a cocktail of resources. It
                is pleasing that football is beginning to move forward; it gives
                a sense of anticipation for better and more family-friendly
                stadia, which is what everyone wants. Therefore, considering
                what has been invested, it is unfair to describe the
                refurbishment programme as a &quot;sticking-plaster job&quot;.</p>

                In the light of the recent sectarian death threats against Neil
                Lennon and the sectarianism associated with some football
                grounds, does the Minister agree that any planned projects
                should proceed only if there is a guaranteed anti-sectarian
                strategy in place.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Anti-sectarianism policies are a key part of
                the grants and revenue scheme that was announced under the safe
                sports ground scheme. Within that scheme, funding will be
                available under three programmes: safety management; urgent
                (first-aid) works; and major works. Soccer, Gaelic football and
                rugby clubs availing of that support are required to have
                anti-sectarian policies in place.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sectarianism is one of the evils — if not
                the evil — of our society. It has been, and continues to be,
                the engine for so much misery for our people. Therefore,
                society, the Assembly and the Executive have much to do. It is
                wrong to characterise sectarianism and say that it is football’s
                problem. It is not only football’s problem; it is Northern
                Ireland’s problem. Problems that appear in football are a
                reflection of society. They appear in other areas, and the
                Assembly seeks to address those problems.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Football is a key sport that could heal the
                problem because it is an interface sport that both communities
                play and through which both communities meet. However, when they
                meet, there are occasionally disgraceful and appalling scenes.
                What happened twice to Neil Lennon was disgraceful, and everyone
                condemned it without question. However, by and large, that sort
                of thing is rare. Football is a way of bringing society
                together, and that is one of the reasons why the Executive and
                the Assembly are seeking to invest in it and in other sports.</p>

                could have benefited from the joint Ireland/ Scotland bid to
                host the European Championships in 2008, if it were not for the
                poor standard of the local stadia? Does he further agree that a

                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was quoted in ‘The Observer’ yesterday
                regarding the bid to host the European Championships in 2008,
                but I did not make a statement to that paper, and the quotes
                ascribed to me are not entirely accurate. Northern Ireland was
                not in a position to join that bid because it does not have an
                international stadium with 30,000 seats. Therefore, if we want
                to get involved in that tournament, our next opportunity is
                2012. However, Northern Ireland cannot do it alone; there would
                have to be some form of partnership. Scotland was going to make
                its own bid, but then it decided to seek partners, and it joined
                up with the Irish Republic. It seems, however, there are
                difficulties in the South in respect of the delivery of large
                stadia, so their bid is in question.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The next opportunity for Northern Ireland
                will be in 2012, but it costs a great deal of money to host that
                type of tournament, and Northern Ireland would have to find its
                share of it. If we had that sort of sum to invest in sport,
                would we want to invest it all in a tournament that lasts a
                couple of weeks in 2012? We will not even be at first base until
                we have a stadium of international standards with 30,000 seats.
                I agree that that is essential.</p>

                Irish Football Association and the Police Service about the
                practicalities of extending the Football (Offences) Act 1991 and
                related legislation to Northern Ireland. The discussions have
                included consideration of the type of legislation that might be
                appropriate for Northern Ireland to control spectator behaviour
                in football grounds, which is the main purpose of the GB Act.
                Those discussions have also taken place in the context of wider
                deliberations on the soccer strategy process.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once again, the Neil Lennon saga shows the
                scourge of sectarianism in football in Northern Ireland;
                unfortunately, it made headlines across the world. The Football
                (Offences) Act 1991 largely deals with race, but it could be
                adjusted because it has been shown to be effective in other
                parts of Great Britain and Scotland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In reply to a previous question, the Minister
                recognised that many Irish League football clubs want to improve
                their grounds and build new stadia. In the Department’s
                efforts to encourage clubs to develop football as a family
                sport, will the Minister agree that there is an urgent need to
                deal with all aspects of hatred and sectarianism, not only in
                football but in all sports?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I said in a previous answer and on
                previous occasions, I was appalled by the Neil Lennon affair. It
                was disgraceful. I condemned it then, and I condemn it now.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sectarianism is not simply a problem in
                football, nor can football on its own solve sectarian problems.
                Sectarianism is not confined to football. Every activity in
                Northern Ireland can be marred by sectarian behaviour.
                Anti-sectarian measures must cover all sports.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Football (Offences) Act 1991 (c.19)
                contains regulations against hooliganism and racism. Three of
                the offences listed are: throwing an object at or towards the
                pitch or spectators, taking part in indecent or racist chanting
                and going onto the pitch without lawful authority. The Act was
                subsequently amended to allow banning orders to ban certain
                spectators from domestic and international matches, and racist
                or indecent chanting was specified for acts abroad.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It could be argued that the Act is one person’s
                solution to another person’s problem. Northern Ireland has
                public order legislation matching that of Great Britain but
                which also outlaws sectarian behaviour. Therefore there are
                weapons on the statute book to deal with sectarianism.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, my Department has had
                discussions about football with the Sports Council for Northern
                Ireland and with the Irish Football Association (IFA). However,
                there are problems across the board; therefore any solution must
                cover sport in general.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department is considering legislation
                that would incorporate the experiences of the mainland as far as
                the Public Order Act is concerned. It will examine how to tackle
                sectarianism at all sporting venues in Northern Ireland — not
                just at football matches. Widespread consultation has begun, and
                we will try to create suitable legislation. I must stress that
                legislation alone will not solve the problem and that
                legislation dealing with sectarianism in football only will be
                inadequate. Although the events surrounding Neil Lennon hit the
                headlines, sectarianism occurs at other events and venues, and
                the solution must go right across the board.</p>

                authorities in Northern Ireland have done an excellent job in
                resolving some of the problems in football? Who will pay for
                enforcing the new measures if we introduce legislation similar
                to the Football (Offences) Act 1991? Will it be the clubs? My
                understanding is that, under the new policing arrangements, the
                police could not afford to pay for it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is the Minister happy with the arrangements
                between the IFA and the police? Will the police stay outside the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, order in the grounds is primarily a
                matter for those who organise the games, and the police will be
                called in only as a last resort. Secondly, the Department is
                some way from deciding the funding to implement any legislation,
                but it will be examined in the consultation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have said several times that steps have
                been taken to address the issues. It is wrong to think that
                nothing has been done. Northern Ireland’s public order
                legislation goes further than that of Great Britain by outlawing
                religious hatred. It is an offence to arouse fear on the basis
                of religious belief and nationality. My Department is involved
                with the IFA’s football for all strategy, which includes a
                code of conduct for spectators, professionals, stewards,
                closed-circuit television provision and the appointment of an
                IFA community relations officer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The IFA and the Sports Council take that
                seriously. I commend the work of both organisations, and the IFA
                have done an excellent job so far. I also commend the police,
                and how they regularly manage large crowds. However, there is an
                argument that they may need further provision through
                legislation, and we will look at that. We will discuss the
                expense through consultation, look at revenue consequences as
                part of that process and satisfy those in due course.</p>

                previous answers, it is not a football-only problem; it goes
                across all sport and all of Northern Ireland society. As I said
                in my answer to Mr Hutchinson, with regard to cost, we are in
                the early stages, and we will work out the revenue consequences
                through that consultation process.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Armagh team is to be congratulated on its
                achievement, which is considerable, as is the junior team of
                Derry. It has been 54 years since two Northern Ireland teams won
                both titles. It is sad for Gaelic athletics that the success was
                besmirched by the activities of a minority of fans who behaved
                disgracefully in Lurgan. I have spoken to officials in Gaelic
                athletics, and they have no time for that. That type of fan does
                Gaelic no good, and Gaelic — as with all sports in Northern
                Ireland — neither needs nor wants them. I also condemn all
                attacks on Orange halls, police stations and Protestant
                churches.</p>

                tag for goods with farmers and producers being paid a fair

                and not one for the devolved institution, so that is not for me
                to consider. As the Member said, there are great difficulties,
                concerns and mistrust in the agrifood industry. Farmers feel
                that they are not getting a fair price for their produce.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That can be resolved through greater
                co-operation in the chain. The Committee for Agriculture and
                Rural Development, of which Mr Savage is the Deputy Chairperson,
                and the Competition Commission, investigated the matter and
                found no evidence of price-fixing or unfair practice. I would be

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With your permission, Mr Deputy Speaker, I
                shall answer Questions 4, 7, 11 and 19 together. I am acutely
                aware of the difficulties experienced by farmers as a
                consequence of the very wet weather over much of the growing
                season. I have monitored the situation very carefully. Over the
                summer, my advisers were active, providing technical advice and
                assistance to producers. Furthermore, an extensive advisory
                programme is planned for the coming months, starting later this
                week with open days at the Agricultural Research Institute at
                Hillsborough.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As well as that practical assistance, I have
                worked hard to secure a relaxation of European Union grazing
                rules on set-aside land and achieved a satisfactory outcome last
                month, together with an increase in cattle subsidy advance
                payments. The possibility of wet weather payments remains open;
                however, to release the necessary funds, any such scheme must
                first secure European Union state aid approval and the agreement
                of the Executive. In both cases, concrete evidence will be
                required to support the argument for financial assistance, and
                such evidence cannot be gathered until the end of the growing
                season. My officials have made arrangements to meet the European
                Union Commission to explore the options in the light of the
                evidence, and I have written to the Executive to brief them on
                the situation.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The growing season is coming to an end, the
                cereal harvest is almost finished, and most farmers say that
                their cereal crops have been significantly reduced. The potato
                harvest is about to commence with low expectations from potato
                farmers. Will the Minister assure the House that as soon as the
                crops have been harvested, her Department will seek financial
                assistance for the farming community? Many farmers have suffered
                greatly over the past few years as a result of foot-and-mouth
                disease and BSE, and the weather this year has been a terrible
                blow to the farming community.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Rodgers:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I assure Mr Poots, as I did in my first
                response, that my officials and I have been monitoring the
                situation. If there is a case to be made to the European
                Commission we will begin to build it as soon as the growing
                season ends. However, we shall not seek financial assistance
                from Europe. In the first place, we will seek state aid approval
                from Europe; if that is granted, I must find the resources in
                our own block budget and get the Executive’s approval. I have
                already spoken on this matter to the Minister of Finance and
                Personnel and to the Executive, and they are aware of the
                farmers’ plight.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was very wet weather during the 1999
                season in the Orkney Islands, yet by the time the case had been
                made, the EU state aid approved and resources allocated, it was
                the following June before payments were made to farmers. Farmers
                should not expect financial assistance before the end of the
                year. It will take some time for the money to become available.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the meantime, through measures such as the
                winter management workshops, the Department is doing everything
                possible to help farmers cope. I recently visited a farm. I am,
                therefore, aware of the damage that has been done to the ground
                by poaching and of the loss and additional costs that farmers
                will incur if their feed bills increase.</p>

                the payment system.</p>

                other issues fall in the remits of the Department of the
                Environment and the Water Service. A mechanism has been
                initiated whereby, with the Department of the Environment, the
                Rivers Agency and other relevant agencies, the Department
                provides a rapid response team that ensures that, if people have
                a problem with flooding, they can contact the correct agency and
                will not be passed from pillar to post. The Department of the

                in the less-favoured areas, which are the minimum thresholds
                specified in the state aid guidelines. The Commission will also
                want to be satisfied that any proposed aid is accurately

                requirements for tagging cattle and sheep. The cattle-tagging
                provisions have been in place for many years, and the tags must
                include letters that identify the member state of origin.
                European Union proposals on sheep identification are to be
                brought forward shortly. Pigs are not required to be tagged,
                although they must have an identifying mark or tattoo before

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My officials have raised with the European
                Commission the possibility of having letters that identify the
                region of origin included in the cattle-tagging arrangements.
                Hitherto, the Commission has not accepted that. I will continue
                to seek that provision for cattle, and for sheep if necessary,
                and to seek support from ministerial colleagues in Britain and

                Ireland is tagged as British, and it should be tagged as having
                come from Northern Ireland. That would be of great benefit to

                European Commission’s agreement to have letters that identify
                the region of origin included in the ear tag. Indeed, I have
                already raised that. However, the introduction of a single ear
                tag for Northern Ireland is unlikely, as EU rules require the
                inclusion of letters in a tag to identify the member state of
                origin, which in our case is the UK. That is the rule in the
                European Commission; it allows only the member state to identify
                cattle. Marketing issues can be dealt with through the method of
                beef labelling that is eventually chosen, though we must abide
                by certain rules in that respect also. That is the current
                position. I have raised the issue, but I am reluctant to say
                that I have the power to change the European Commission’s

                a marketing label device, which will admit weaned cattle
                imported from the Irish Republic? It was tradition, prior to the
                establishment of this Assembly, for farmers to buy store cattle
                from the Irish Republic for fattening. Those cattle came up as
                weanlings at around six months of age. Would it be possible for
                such cattle to be labelled for marketing purposes as British

                and not one for the Minister to address. I am aware of the
                problem, and I discussed it with the industry. Beef labelling
                must state where the animal was sourced, slaughtered, and so on.
                It is a commercial issue as to whether such beef is regarded as
                British or Irish beef.</p>

                French food standards agency, Agence Française de Sécurité
                Sanitaire des Aliments (AFSSA), that the French Government will
                move very quickly to remove the ban. The indications are that

                position to export beef to France under the new date-based
                export scheme (DBES) rules. I will do all in my power as
                Minister to encourage support for Northern Irish beef in the
                French market — within the rules of competition, of course. My
                officials have been in discussion with some of the meat
                factories, which are anxious to begin exporting, especially to
                France, as there is a market for our beef there. That is good

                date-based export system, and what steps are the Department
                taking to improve the percentage of eligible animals?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, does the Minister expect to see an
                increase in beef and sheep-meat prices to farmers, given that
                export processors should now enjoy a wider range of markets?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will take the last part of the Member’s

                the farmers because of wider markets.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to the number of cattle eligible
                for the date-based export scheme, about 50% or 60% of cattle in
                a typical month are export eligible under the scheme. Many more
                cattle would be eligible if notification of animal births and
                movements were made on time by herd keepers. I am committed to
                ensuring that the EU rules of cattle identification and
                traceability are fully implemented. To that effect, I am phasing
                in additional control measures, including individual animal and
                herd restrictions for cattle identification and movement
                irregularities, as required by EU Regulations. Better compliance
                with animal identification and movement rules should, in turn,
                increase the date-based export scheme eligibility in the future.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I consulted widely on the vision group
                report, after its publication in October 2001. In March 2002, I
                announced 11 measures, addressing 30 of the vision group’s
                recommendations, which could be implemented without additional
                resources. My original intention was to release the full vision
                group action plan at the end of June 2002. However, I decided to
                delay its publication until November 2002, so that account could
                be taken of the mid-term review of the common agricultural
                policy. I emphasise that the delay in announcing the vision
                group action plan will not cause any delay in the implementation
                of the recommendations. In addition to allowing me to make
                adjustments in response to the mid-term review, the delay will
                enable me to bring all my proposals together in one

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly Commission has agreed a
                wide-ranging information strategy that addresses not only the
                information needs of the Assembly but the needs of the public
                for information about the Assembly and its business. The
                strategy is in the public domain by way of the Assembly web
                site. The strategy recognises the need to produce and present
                information in ways that best meet the needs of different
                groups, such as schools, special interest groups, academics,
                Departments and the public in general.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In order to implement the information
                strategy, the Executive Information Office has recently
                recruited two education officers to develop an information and
                education programme about the Assembly and its work. As part of
                that programme, a series of public information leaflets dealing
                with various aspects of the Assembly’s work will be produced.
                Proposals for the design and content of the first of those
                leaflets will be put to the Assembly Commission for approval in
                the next few weeks.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am pleased to hear that, finally, something
                is being done. I hold in my hand the Scottish Parliament’s
                information leaflets, which have been available to the public
                for many years. They contain everything from information on the
                devolved Parliament and guidance for witnesses giving evidence
                to Committees, to how to approach MSPs. It is an excellent
                educational information brochure. Given the value of the work
                being done by our colleagues across the water, I am disappointed
                that the Assembly Commission did not make it a priority to get
                information to the public sooner.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why has it taken so long to produce an
                information strategy? Will leaflets of the same type and quality
                as the Scottish Parliament’s be available at least before the
                end of the year? Will the Assembly Commission consider setting
                aside a budget for educational and/or information tools for
                younger primary schoolchildren who, after a tour of the
                Building, leave totally empty-handed? That is not the case in
                some local councils, where children who visit leave with pencils
                or rubbers. Will the Commission agree to set aside a budget for
                such a valuable educational tool for everyone, and especially
                for young people?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a personal level, I agree with everything
                that the Member has said. The Assembly Commission has been
                considering all aspects of information strategies for young
                people and the public in general. Education officers will
                consider some of the aspects relating to young people that you
                mentioned. We have decided to implement the simple strategy of
                giving children a pencil. Plans are in the melting pot at
                present, but we will inform the Assembly of our work as it
                progresses.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree that the Scottish pack is a good
                idea. I have given the Assembly Commission samples of it,
                because it hopes to produce a similar pack. Members’ points
                will be noted in Hansard and taken on board as part of the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before devolution, a press liaison group was
                established to discuss matters of mutual interest, including
                media access and facilities in Parliament Buildings. A press
                lobby system to facilitate access was proposed, but the press
                did not find that proposal appropriate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Earlier this year, after a meeting between
                media representatives and the Assembly Commission, it was agreed
                that the Commission would consider proposals to enhance press
                access in the Buildings. It was agreed that media
                representatives would reconsider the proposal to establish a
                press lobby and then offer its views to the Commission. To date,
                that has not happened.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A key consideration of the Commission is the
                facilitation of Assembly business and the provision of a safe
                working environment for Members, staff and the visiting public.
                The Commission values the role of the press in promoting a
                better understanding of the Assembly and its Committees, and
                would welcome proposals for improving press access.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was disappointed at the press fallout after
                the Queen’s visit and other occasions. The Assembly has
                managed to make an enemy rather than a friend of the press.
                Media facilities and access do not appear to be a problem in
                other devolved institutions. I cannot understand why the liaison
                committee never met; perhaps it could be re-established
                urgently. I ask the Commission to take the issue seriously, so
                that the apparent lack of communication as regards press access
                during the Queen’s visit does not arise again. The same
                approach should apply to press access during visits by other
                dignitaries, and to the provision of information that we wish
                the press to report. The Assembly seems to have fallen foul in
                that regard, and the press seem to end up reporting negatively
                on it.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree; however, the Commission and the
                press have met to discuss proposals many times. We are
                considering their proposals for access and better information,
                and I hope that they are considering ours. The press conference
                arena in the basement of the Building is rarely used. The Head
                of Security, the Speaker, and other Members who deal with the
                press met representatives, and the Commission also met the
                Chairpersons’ Liaison Group. I hope that proposals will result
                from those meetings.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I take on board the Member’s comments;
                however, the Commission has already tried the approach that she
                suggested. I hope that the Assembly will be able to establish a
                better relationship and better communication with the press. The
                Commission shares the Members hope that the problems that arose
                in the past do not happen again.</p>

                Regulations and the Part-Time Workers Regulations for debate.

                motion before putting the question without further debate. If
                that is clear, I shall proceed.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister for Employment and Learning (Ms
                Hanna):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall continue where I left off.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am aware that fixed-term contracts are used
                in sectors ranging from higher education to the hospitality
                industry. In some instances, sectors or organisations may wish
                to tailor the mechanism limiting the use of successive
                fixed-term contracts to suit their needs better. Therefore the
                Regulations provide for employers and employees to increase or
                decrease the four-year limit or to agree a different way in
                order to prevent the abuse of successive fixed-term contracts by
                collective or workforce agreements. Those agreements could, for
                example, specify allowable reasons for renewing fixed-term
                contracts beyond the statutory limit.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important that the law does not permit
                fixed-term employees to be treated less favourably than
                permanent employees. Therefore these Regulations also amend
                provisions in certain parts of some Orders, which, unless
                amended, would allow some or all fixed-term employees to be
                treated less favourably than permanent employees. For example,
                the Employment Rights (Northern Ireland) Order 1996 permits
                fixed-term employees to waive their right to redundancy
                payments. The Fixed Term Employees (Prevention of Less
                Favourable Treatment) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2002 will
                remove that redundancy waiver.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The modest costs associated with these
                Regulations are more than offset by the advantages that they
                bring in fairness and the ending of the potential for
                discrimination. The regulatory impact assessment commissioned by
                my Department estimated costs to the private sector of about £1
                million to £4 million. The Regulations will create an even
                playing field for employers of fixed-term contract employees.
                However, it is right that fixed-term employees should be treated
                no less favourably than permanent employees.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I now turn to the two amendments to the
                Part-Time Workers (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment)
                Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2000. These Regulations make it
                unlawful for employers to treat part-timers less favourably than
                comparable full-timers in their terms and conditions of
                employment unless different treatment can be justified
                objectively.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under the present Part-Time Workers
                Regulations, part-time workers must compare themselves to
                full-timers employed under a similar contract. The amendment
                will allow part-time workers to compare themselves with
                full-time staff on both permanent and fixed-term contracts. That
                will ensure that part-time workers on fixed-term contracts are
                not treated less favourably than permanent workers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second amendment also aims at bringing
                the Part-Time Workers Regulations into line with the Fixed Term
                Employees Regulations. At present, if an industrial tribunal
                upholds a complaint from a part-time worker about equal access
                to an occupational pension scheme, the remedy awarded may not
                exceed a limit of two years’ worth of employer contributions.
                That reflects the House of Lords ruling in February 2001 in the
                case of Preston and Others v Wolverhampton Healthcare NHS Trust
                and Others. The amendment Regulations remove that restriction.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Compliance costs are estimated to be low.
                Those employers who treat their part-time workers equally to
                their full-time staff will experience no direct costs. The days
                where most of the labour force worked nine to five in a job for
                life are past. It is widely recognised that a more flexible
                approach is not only good for employees, but it can also enhance
                competitiveness. In this context, it is particularly important
                to protect the rights of the growing numbers on fixed-term and
                part-time contracts. Fixed-term and part-time work allows people
                to participate in the labour market who, perhaps due to family
                or other commitments, may not wish to accept permanent or
                full-time employment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For their part, employers should see the
                benefits of greater loyalty and commitment among their
                fixed-term and part-time staff. Overall, the draft Fixed Term
                Employees (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations
                (Northern Ireland) 2002 and the Part-Time Workers (Prevention of
                Less Favourable Treatment) (Amendment) Regulations (Northern
                Ireland) 2002 contribute to improving employment rights in the
                workforce, and I commend both sets of Regulations to the
                Assembly.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appreciate the Minister’s comments about
                the late delivery to the Committee of the Statutory Rule
                relating to part-time workers. As Chairperson of the Committee
                for Employment and Learning, I support both sets of Regulations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With reference to the draft Fixed Term
                Employees (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations
                (Northern Ireland) 2002, the Committee considered the pre-draft
                Statutory Rule at its meeting on 9 May 2002 and had no
                objections to the policy implications of the proposed
                legislation at that stage. The Committee noted that the equality
                impact assessment on the proposed Regulations indicated that
                there would be no adverse impact on any of the section 75
                groups. The Minister referred to the regulatory impact
                assessment, and the Committee noted that it estimated a net cost
                to employers ranging from £1·5 million to £7·6 million, with
                about half of that falling on the public sector. It was expected
                that very little cost would fall on small businesses.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee considered the Statutory Rule
                at its most recent meeting on Thursday 19 September and
                supported its key objectives, especially the prevention of
                discrimination against fixed-term employees.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On behalf of the Committee, I urge support
                for the Part-Time Workers (Prevention of Less Favourable
                Treatment) (Amendment) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2002 (SR
                286/2002). These Regulations amend the Part-Time Workers
                (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations (Northern
                Ireland) 2000 (SR 219/2000) and are due to come into force on 1
                October. As with the previous Statutory Rule, the original date
                for implementation was 1 July 2002, but the Department of Trade
                and Industry in London requested that further time be given to
                the UK to implement the EU Directive on fixed-term work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee considered the Statutory Rule
                at its meeting on 19 September 2002 and supported the key
                objectives outlined by the Minister. The first is to maintain
                consistency with the EU Directive on fixed-term work, and the
                second is to comply with the judgment made by the House of Lords
                in the Preston and Others v Wolverhampton Healthcare NHS and
                Others.</p>

                I support the motion. Given that the amendments have been taken
                as part of an European Directive, and the fact that many women
                have to take part-time or fixed-term work due to family
                commitments, I am glad to see that the prevention of less
                favourable treatment has been taken on board by the Minister.
                Could we not do more, above and beyond what the EU suggests, to
                make working conditions for part-time and fixed-term workers
                even more favourable to the needs of working parents?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also welcome the introduction of the
                Statutory Rules. As Michelle Gildernew said, they originated
                from European Directives. The people concerned were once
                commonly known as atypical workers, but the days when we had the
                typical worker from nine to five on a permanent contract are
                long gone. Many employees now have atypical working patterns, so
                the more inclusive our legislation, the better, especially with
                regard to the prevention of less favourable treatment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remember when part-time workers began to
                secure some rights along the same lines as full-time workers.
                The first thing that employers did was make their part-time
                workers redundant, since, they said, they could not implement
                the Regulation without considerable cost to themselves. Clearly,
                equality issues were involved. I know of some dispute involving
                Queen’s University Belfast and the University of Ulster. In
                particular, the University of Ulster’s fixed-term employees
                think that they will lose their jobs before the legislation
                comes into force.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the legislation comes into force, what
                will happen to the employer of a person who has been working for
                four years on a fixed-term contract — I believe that that is
                the term in the legislation — if he or she decides to replace
                them? What are the employee’s rights if he or she wishes to
                take that employer to court or to a tribunal because of unfair
                dismissal? Those of us who are familiar with labour relations
                know that many part-time workers did not benefit from previous
                legislation; they simply lost their jobs as a consequence.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Hanna:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today’s workforce is an increasingly
                diverse entity. I firmly believe that such enhanced flexibility
                brings considerable benefits to employers and workers alike. It
                is therefore important that those who wish to work on fixed-term
                or part-time contracts are not discouraged from doing so by the
                threat of less favourable treatment. I welcome the remarks of
                the Chairperson of the Committee for Employment and Learning and
                his acceptance of reassurances.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are dealing with specific issues in the
                legislation, but Members are probably aware that an employment
                status review is under way. I hope that issues outside the
                legislation will be taken up through that. That probably does
                not answer the specific question regarding Queen’s University,
                but I do not think I could answer that now, nor would it be
                appropriate for me to do so here. However, I shall most
                certainly do so in writing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Fixed Term Employees (Prevention of Less
                Favourable Treatment) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2002 and
                the Part-Time Workers (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment)
                (Amendment) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2002 will protect the
                rights of the increasing number of individuals on fixed-term, or
                part-time, contracts who might otherwise suffer detrimental work
                habits compared with their permanent or full-time colleagues.
                Such workers have an important role to play in helping to meet
                organisations’ needs for more flexible labour solutions which
                contribute to the creation of high-performance workplaces.</p>

                2002. Members will know that it is the Committee’s practice to
                seek the views of all key stakeholders, as well as those of
                groups most likely to be affected by any legislation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is an important piece of legislation.
                Consequently, the Committee has canvassed the views of all 26
                councils and 17 other bodies, such as the Construction Employers
                Federation, the Royal Town Planning Institute and the Woodland
                Trust. Seventeen responses have been received to date. As
                expected, some have raised interesting and valid concerns, and
                these were passed to the Department for comment. Over the past
                weeks, the Committee has received presentations from
                departmental officials responding to those points, and that
                process is ongoing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the Second Stage of the Bill, some
                Members spoke of the need for third-party appeals. The Committee
                has already obtained a commitment from the Minister that his
                Department will commence a full public consultation on the way
                forward for third-party appeals by Christmas of this year. The
                Committee is concerned about the Planning (Amendment) Bill in
                relation to third-party appeals.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although full details will be provided in the
                Committee’s report on the Bill, Members will be pleased to
                learn that the Committee has persuaded the Minister to take
                other important issues forward. Two of those require the
                Secretary of State’s approval; namely, increasing the maximum
                fine from £20,000 to £30,000, and introducing a new offence of
                commencing development before planning permission is given.
                Those are significant steps forward and highlight the Committee’s
                hard work on the Bill.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are more issues for the Committee to
                explore that will require due and proper deliberation.
                Consequently, the Committee has considered it necessary to ask
                the Assembly for an extension. As always, it is the Committee’s
                hope that its work will be completed by an earlier date.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With your permission, Madam Deputy Speaker, I
                will explain to the House why the extension is being sought. The
                Committee for the Environment began its formal scrutiny of the
                Bill on 18 June 2002. Members who have read the Bill will
                appreciate that it is complex, of a technical nature and
                requires close scrutiny.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee heard presentations from and
                held discussions with departmental officials. This included a
                structured clause-by-clause presentation of the Bill on 20 June
                2002. The Committee has also canvassed the views of all district
                councils together with 12 other interested bodies, such as the
                Council for Nature Conservation and the Countryside, and the
                Royal Town Planning Institute. To date, seven responses have
                been received and, as expected, they have raised some pertinent
                and legitimate concerns which have been submitted to the
                Department for its comment and consideration.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was also agreed that the Department would
                consult with key stakeholders to ascertain their views on the
                terms of the Bill. That consultation has taken longer than
                expected, and the Department has indicated that it will shortly
                be in a position to come back before the Committee on this Bill.
                It should prove to be a valuable exercise for all concerned, and
                it will require due and proper deliberation by the Committee.
                Consequently, the Committee has considered it appropriate to ask
                the Assembly to grant this extension of time.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.
                I thank the Minister for his full and comprehensive response to
                the Committee. May I take this opportunity to congratulate the
                Armagh team on its fine victory yesterday; perhaps the Chamber
                is so empty because Members are all down celebrating in the
                county.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee wishes to see energy remain at
                the top of the political agenda, so it decided to stimulate a
                further debate on the energy report and the issues contained in
                it rather than deal with them by correspondence alone. We hoped
                that that would afford other Members the opportunity to
                contribute to this area of public policy. The Committee is
                looking forward to having a closer look at some of the relevant
                issues when considering the energy Bill later in the session.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As there are 45 recommendations, I do not
                have enough time to deal with each one and the Minister’s
                response to them. I will concentrate on two issues which
                Committee members feel strongly about. I was pleased that many
                of the Committee’s most important recommendations were
                accepted by the Department: recommendation 3 on consumer
                protection; recommendation 4 on cross-subsidies; recommendation
                14 on Coolkeeragh; and recommendation 40 on postalisation of
                costs. However, I remain disappointed that Departments were not
                prepared to think outside the box in some cases. Some responses
                were negative and lacked imagination, and I will deal with them
                later.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee made three recommendations
                regarding the eradication of fuel poverty. It has been said in
                previous debates, but it is worth repeating, that it is a
                scandal that 170,000 homes in the North are considered to be
                fuel poor. The Executive must make every effort to deal with the
                problem. The Committee recommended that the Government match,
                pound for pound, the money raised through the energy efficiency
                levy — £600,000 per year. If such funds cannot be directly
                obtained from the Treasury, they should be found from the
                Executive funds. That would reduce the time taken to eradicate
                fuel poverty from 10 to five years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some £600,000 is a small price to pay. The
                knock-on benefits to the Department of Health, Social Services
                and Public Safety’s budget, for example, would be enormous, as
                it would reduce the cases of illnesses related to fuel poverty
                such as flu and chest infections and other chest-related
                illnesses by a huge amount. It would be money well spent.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee was pleased to note that the
                Minister for Social Development is committed to producing a fuel
                poverty strategy, and we look forward to examining his
                proposals. The Committee was also pleased to note that the
                regulator is introducing plans that will make the energy
                efficiency levy process more accountable and transparent so that
                the public can see exactly how and where the funds are being
                spent.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the question of renewable energy, the
                Committee is encouraged with the progress on developing the
                potential offshore wind farm off the north coast. I agree with
                the Minister that that development will be crucial if renewable
                energy targets are to be met. I hope that the Minister will
                agree that the misinformation being used against the development
                is extremely unhelpful and that it only serves to breed fear and
                confusion. The Committee is disappointed that the Minister could
                not agree with our target of having 15% of electricity from a
                range of renewable sources by 2010 but has instead opted for
                10%. I accept that the majority of respondents to his
                consultation exercise agreed that 10% was appropriate, but the
                Committee believes that a target of 15% will encourage greater
                imagination in research and development of the necessary
                technologies. That target is challenging, but it is achievable
                if we put our minds to it. The Committee made various
                recommendations that sought to encourage greater demand for
                green electricity. We are deeply disappointed that the
                Departments responsible for dealing with those recommendations
                could not be more positive in their responses.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In recommendation 27, for example, the
                Committee stated that local area development plans should
                include provision for the location and development of renewable
                energy sources. The response that we received may have been
                technically correct, but it did not attempt to address the real
                issues, which are about helping to plan ahead for the
                development and use of renewable energy sources.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recommendation 28 called for the planning and
                building control bodies to be proactive in the encouragement of
                low-energy buildings and renewable energy. The response saying
                that current strategies and legislation do not cover this point
                is simply not good enough. If the Executive want to take their
                obligations under the Kyoto protocol seriously, they need to
                demonstrate joined-up thinking on the encouragement, stimulation
                and development of renewable energy sources and technologies. It
                is unacceptable that Departments appear to be unsupportive of
                one another on the matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee is pleased that the Minister
                and his Department are trying to develop the renewable energy
                industry in response to recommendations 34, 35, 36 and 37.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee intends to keep plugging away
                at the issues raised in the energy inquiry report. I am glad
                that the report will help to stimulate public debate, and I hope
                that the Minister will be encouraged to look afresh at points
                raised today.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for
                Enterprise, Trade and Investment (Mr Neeson): </b>I welcome the
                Minister’s response to the Committee. The energy inquiry was
                an in-depth investigation that lasted longer than the Committee
                anticipated. The Committee will soon consider the draft energy
                Bill, which is very detailed. I assure the Minister that the
                Committee will approach the task with the same interest that it
                took in the original investigation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The major issue is the high cost of
                electricity in Northern Ireland. In addition, the Assembly must
                consider long-term contracts. The Committee recently met Jamie
                Delargy and Sir George Quigley to discuss bonds financing as a
                possible means of buying out the contracts. Only two weeks ago,
                I met senior officials from Northern Ireland Electricity to
                discuss their proposals. The Committee has not decided how it
                will proceed with the matter. It will examine those, and other,
                proposals. It must focus on its aim, which is to lower the cost
                of electricity in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the fact that the natural gas
                pipeline will go ahead, not only because it will benefit the
                north-west, but because of its benefit to the South/North
                pipeline. I sincerely hope that natural gas will benefit
                domestic consumers as much as businesses and that it will create
                a level playing field for all consumers in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am still dismayed that people inside and
                outside the Assembly are trying to impede the project’s
                development. One of the first all-party delegations that met in
                the Assembly dealt with the provision of natural gas to the
                north-west. Every party was represented before we even had
                devolution. Natural gas has widespread support across the
                political boundaries. I am delighted that the projected
                commissioning date of autumn 2004 has been agreed for
                Coolkeeragh power station, which will be one of the main
                beneficiaries of the pipeline to the north-west.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must not put all our eggs in the one
                basket. We must remember that the new combined cycle gas turbine
                (CCGT) power station at Ballylumford will be commissioned soon.
                I, and local representatives, will visit that power station in a
                week or so.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Combined cycle gas turbine will also power
                Coolkeeragh, so we must be careful not to put all our eggs in
                one basket. The future energy uses at Kilroot must be different
                from natural gas. If Kilroot goes ahead with phase two of the
                power station, it could use gas, but there must be some
                diversification.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee took considerable interest in
                the development of renewable energy, and we welcome the
                Department’s commitment to it. However, I agree with the
                Chairperson that the larger target of 15% by 2010 is preferable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was remiss of me to leave out
                postalisation when talking about the natural gas pipeline. It is
                important that all consumers pay the same price for natural gas,
                regardless of where they live in Northern Ireland. The Committee
                has a major challenge ahead in dealing with the energy Bill, but
                we will approach it with the same determination with which we
                approached the original report.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Armstrong:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a member of the Committee for Enterprise,
                Trade and Investment, I am well aware of the challenges facing
                consumers and businesses with regard to the higher cost and
                lower availability of energy resources in Northern Ireland. I
                commend the energy inquiry report to the Minister; its numerous
                recommendations can provide a cheaper, greener service for
                energy consumers, and they suggest means for transforming waste
                into energy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the industry was privatised in 1992,
                long-term contracts were introduced that will continue until
                2012; these have benefited only stakeholders at the expense of
                consumers. The report recognises the failings in the energy
                sector and seeks to improve consumers’ lot — the ordinary
                men and women for whom energy is a basic need.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report recognises the need to make
                consumer protection a priority when determining arrangements in
                the energy sector. That is why we suggest that the General
                Consumer Council be given stronger powers to represent consumers’
                rights to cheaper, diverse sources of energy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some 170,000 householders in Northern Ireland
                are classed fuel poor. I welcome initiatives, such as the warm
                homes scheme, which seek to redress people’s difficulties in
                affording energy. The report’s recommendation to increase the
                energy efficiency levy to £5 per customer is one way of
                eradicating fuel poverty, and the Minister should consider that
                more closely.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Increasing the efficient use of energy is one
                way of reducing cost to the consumer. Efficient appliances are
                vital, as they use energy sources with more care. However, the
                report also suggests ways in which the price per unit of
                electricity and other costs can be reduced. It is unacceptable
                that a 306% rise in output per generation worker has translated
                into only a 15% productivity gain to consumers. It is
                unacceptable that consumers are expected to fund long-term
                contracts while shareholders make large profits at their
                expense.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The importance of the environment in any
                future energy strategy is recognised in the report. I suggest
                that alternative sources of energy should receive assistance
                through Government funding. The report mentions the recently
                established biogas scheme in Fivemiletown. I am in favour of
                such schemes that convert waste products, particularly farm
                waste, into useful sources of energy. There is great potential
                for locating biogas digesters throughout Northern Ireland to
                reduce waste storage difficulties and to provide power for local
                schools and communities. The Minister will recall that I have
                written to him on this, and I hope that he will fully consider
                it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland depends on traditional
                energy sources. Much more needs to be done to promote the use of
                renewable energy. Some 60% of our electricity is produced from
                gas, as opposed to 38% in the UK as a whole. With volatile
                worldwide markets for oil and, perhaps soon, gas, we must act
                immediately to redress our energy deficit. We are aware of the
                huge potential to generate electricity through harnessing wind
                power. However, that must be sensibly managed to preserve the
                natural beauty of our landscape.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Especially in the face of international
                obligations, the Northern Ireland energy sector must undergo
                significant changes in the next few years in order to comply
                with obligations on renewable energy. In the Republic of
                Ireland, one company supplies green electricity generated by
                wind at a lower price than electricity generated by fossil
                fuels. I support an eco-energy tariff that does not impose
                additional charges on customers who opt for green energy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is vital that all parties concerned are
                encouraged to adopt environmentally friendly measures to
                generate energy. I hope that the Minister will further consider
                funding biomass schemes, such as the one at Brook Hall Estate in
                Londonderry. Willow coppice is a feedstock for producing
                electricity from biomass. The benefits of introducing such a
                scheme on a more widespread basis include an aid to rural
                development in addition to further diversifying the energy mix.
                There is also the further side benefit of reducing waste because
                biomass acts as a bio-filter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that the Minister of Enterprise, Trade
                and Investment will seriously consider the importance of
                increasing the range of energy sources used to generate power.
                The report recommends that planning and building control bodies
                should also show greater awareness by encouraging low-energy
                buildings to reduce energy consumption.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In planning for the future fuel-energy
                market, we must give particular consideration to fuel poverty in
                rural areas. There are no plans at present for the alternative
                energy source of gas to be extended outside Belfast and the
                north-west and south-east of the Province, so I hope that the
                Minister will consider the importance of promoting and funding
                alternative energy sources, such as anaerobic digesters, in
                rural areas. The Minister should also endorse postalisation so
                that more dispersed rural communities can also benefit from
                renewable energy sources.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr McDonnell:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Discussions on energy are always timely —
                we could probably discuss energy once a month. As I said in a
                debate a few months ago, the future of energy is one of the most
                important issues that we face. It is a lifeblood of our society
                not only socially, but economically. We shall have to keep
                returning to the matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although I disagree with one or two points, I
                broadly welcome the Minister’s response. It is only
                appropriate that I should pay tribute to the sterling work of
                the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment. The
                Chairperson, Pat Doherty, the Deputy Chairperson, Sean Neeson,
                and my Colleagues on that Committee should be thanked for the
                massive amount of work that was put into the original inquiry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several issues must be addressed, including
                financing debt at a lower cost. We must buy out the stranded
                costs and do what we can to reduce the excessive charges that
                were tied up in the original scandalous contracts. The
                legislation must contain, or new legislation must be enacted to
                provide for, low-cost borrowing mechanisms in the energy
                industry that will allow for the servicing of debt and for the
                burden of debt to be reduced. That in itself would create small
                but significant savings for customers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am told that if lending institutions were
                allowed to use customers’ credit ratings, they might rate
                customers as more creditworthy than do NIE and would charge
                lower rates of interest, which would benefit the customers.
                There seems to be no great desire to include a low-cost
                financing option in the forthcoming energy Bill, but one must be
                included. If that option is not included in the original Bill,
                it must be included at Consideration Stage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Committee Colleagues have already touched
                on the scandal of fuel poverty. The Committee Chairman, Pat
                Doherty, cited the 170,000 homes — 28% of our people — that
                experience fuel poverty. I welcome the Minister’s support for
                the increase in the energy levy to an average of £5 per
                customer. The extra money that that will generate will be of
                great value to the homes affected by that scourge and will go
                some way towards eradicating it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I also agree with recommendation 10.
                The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment and the
                Department for Social Development must together develop an
                aggressive and effective task force on fuel poverty. It is not
                enough to take action such as raising levies in a passive or
                semi-active way; this problem must be dealt with aggressively
                and forcibly. The task force and the Executive must make the
                rapid eradication of fuel poverty a priority underpinned by
                legislation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Like Mr Doherty, I believe that if the
                Exchequer cannot provide the necessary resources to eliminate
                fuel poverty, it behoves the Executive to find them as quickly
                as possible. The longer that that scandal pertains, the longer
                the Assembly will be ridiculed for not effectively getting to
                grips with government and the issues that affect people’s
                lives.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recommendation 38 proposes the consideration
                of the establishment of a renewable energy agency. If such an
                agency is established, it will help us to focus on and adopt a
                much more serious approach to renewables, especially in the
                light of the Executive’s commitment to ensuring that 10% of
                energy will come from renewable sources. Like other Members, I
                am not satisfied with 10% — it should be 15%. A much greater
                commitment to developing renewable energy is needed. In many
                respects, we pay little more than lip service to it. It sounds
                nice, and it seems green, reasonable and user-friendly. However,
                as I told the House before the summer recess, an all-embracing
                energy agency is needed. I have let the matter rest until other
                issues have been debated, but if we do not return to it, we will
                never be in control of our energy resources. We can talk all we
                like, but there is no evidence that the Department of
                Agriculture and Rural Development is offering farmers effective
                incentives to produce renewable energy products. Until we have
                joined-up government that involves the Department of Enterprise,
                Trade and Investment and the Department for Social Development,
                and which pulls in all aspects of energy production, consumption
                and usage, we will not have the necessary grip on energy issues.
                The renewable energy debate must be renewed and engaged in with
                much more vigour than has been the case.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Agriculture should be
                involved. There are problems in the agriculture industry and, if
                a few people knew that they could diversify into energy products
                if the market were stable, it would perhaps be a welcome
                respite. However, I see no great incentive to do that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the question of creating an
                all-island energy market, which was raised in recommendation 42
                and in other recommendations in the report. North and South, we
                are an island community of only five million to six million
                people. That is not a large number in relation to a stable
                energy supply from multiple sources, and it is not enough in
                respect of an all-island energy economy. Greater co-operation
                with the UK must be obtained, particularly with Scotland. The
                Moyle interconnector is an excellent example of that. It has
                been fully loaded and used, and has gone some way towards
                creating an opening in the market. An open energy market is not
                possible without the supply. Douglas McIldoon said:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Moyle Interconnector, with a
                capacity of 500MW, has been developed as a strategic
                infrastructure project to link the previously isolated NI
                electricity system to the systems of Great Britain (GB) and the
                European mainland. The benefits of access to these larger
                systems for the NI electricity consumer include downward
                pressure on electricity prices from increased competition in
                generation along with enhanced security and diversity of
                supply.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Without adequate interconnecting capacity
                there can be no market. Our current problem, however, is that
                because the interconnector is fully used and fully loaded, there
                is no spare capacity. Expensive as it may be, we may very well
                need a second interconnector to double the capacity between
                Northern Ireland and Scotland. We must have a freer, more
                competitive and relatively open market as quickly as possible.
                If that is not done, if there are closed shops and restricted
                supplies, opportunities and choice, we can talk all we like, but
                that will not bring about change.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I could make other points, but I shall not.
                Other Members referred to the scandalously high price of the
                privatisation of the power stations. One primary focus should be
                to concentrate on the liberalisation of the market to promote as
                much competition as possible, so that the price of electricity
                comes down and the economics begin to make sense. They do not
                make sense now.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wells:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once again, sadly, the debate on energy has
                not proved to be the hottest ticket in town. I am delighted that
                Mr Davis has appeared. At one stage, it looked as if Dr Birnie
                would be the only non-member of the Committee to take part in
                the debate, with the exception of the Minister. It is either a
                tremendous vote of confidence or a sign of apathy with regard to
                the work of the Committee. Members perhaps feel that the
                Committee has done such a good job and that the report is so
                watertight that it is not necessary to scrutinise its work, that
                it is a five-star Committee and there is nothing to worry about.
                Either that, or the level of interest in the crucial subject of
                energy is not what it should be. I am not sure of the reason,
                but on the three occasions on which this topic has arisen it has
                attracted very few Members. That said, however, it reveals a
                slight deficiency in the Standing Orders of the Assembly. There
                is no provision for a statement to be made by a Committee
                Chairperson. That provision existed in previous Assemblies and
                is a neat way of dealing with responses from Government
                Departments to Committee reports.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course, we are required to use the more
                unwieldy mechanism of a motion, which is often heard late in the
                afternoon, rather than during the morning’s business. Having
                said that, the Minister has made a steady but positive response
                to the Committee’s report.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If I were asked to describe the Minister in
                cricketing terms, I would say that he is more of a Geoffrey
                Boycott than an Ian Botham. Geoffrey Boycott tended to bat
                steadily and solidly, deflecting the bouncers and chalking up
                quite a few maiden overs, as opposed to Ian Botham, who nailed
                his colours to the mast and struck out with the bat. In reading
                the Minister’s report, I realised that he has a deft way of
                saying no. He reminds me of a young lady whom I asked out many
                times. Rather than say &quot;No, I think that you are the
                ugliest person in the school&quot;, she offered good excuses
                that did not upset me, such as &quot;I am doing my hair&quot;,
                &quot;I have to look after my maiden aunt&quot;, or &quot;I have
                to go shopping&quot;. The Minister does the same thing. Nowhere
                does he say that the Committee’s report is a load of nonsense
                or that it is extreme. He always has a &quot;no, but&quot; reply
                to the recommendations, which, I suppose, is how Ministers
                attain the tacit support of Committees on many issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister could have been bold and
                responded to the recommendation on nuclear power as follows:
                &quot;It is not a transferred matter. It is for officials at
                Westminster, but my view is: nuclear power in Northern Ireland
                — over my dead body&quot;. He could have nailed his colours to
                the mast, made a name for himself, and gained much support from
                the people of Northern Ireland, who are extremely worried about
                the health implications of Sellafield and nuclear power
                production. But, no, the Minister batted steady, sidestepping
                the issue by saying that it was not a matter for his Department
                — a neat answer but not, perhaps, the bravest.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report recommends a radical rethink of
                the proportion of energy that will be produced by renewable
                fuel. Again, the Minister played with a straight bat, stuck to
                previous policy and stated that the proportion should be 10% —
                no more, no less. He could have said that although he would
                welcome an increase to 20% or 25% he must comply with the
                constraints, but, again, he did not comment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not want to be negative, because the
                Department responded positively to several issues raised by the
                Committee. The Committee, the Assembly and the Minister are
                agreed on fuel poverty, an issue that unites the community. It
                is one of the few situations in which everybody would gain. If
                there were an adequate programme to tackle fuel poverty, we
                would lower carbon dioxide emissions, because less heat would be
                lost up the chimney and less fossil fuel would be used. We would
                also improve the health of the community, because fewer old
                people would contract serious diseases and die from cold-related
                illness. Those measures would result in a saving for the
                Exchequer, because less money would be spent on treating the ill
                and less would be wasted on social security payments to provide
                fuel.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee supports strongly the
                recommendation to increase the levy to £5, especially as it
                learnt that the average levy would be £5 a household. The home
                occupied by Dr McDonnell, the hon Member for South Belfast, a
                man of numerous incomes, would therefore sustain a much higher
                levy than the home of a working-class person in east Belfast.
                The richer members of society will pay a much higher proportion
                of the levy than poorer people. The Committee also discovered
                that, as the levy is also taken from industrial and commercial
                users, it is not spread over 600,000 domestic consumers; it is
                spread over the entire community. In some instances, therefore,
                the levy could be as little as 75p a year for households that
                use little energy. If that is the case, it is a small price to
                pay to alleviate the scourge of fuel poverty in the Province,
                especially among the elderly. One of the main obstacles to the
                increase of the levy was that many people felt that £5 a
                household was too much. That is not the case, and the fuel poor
                are not paying the lion’s share. Therefore, the Minister’s
                response was positive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also glad that he left the door open on
                Orimulsion. There is no getting away from it: Orimulsion has
                been a controversial fuel in some parts of the world. Work on
                the energy inquiry led to one of the most beneficial and
                productive visits that any Assembly Committee has ever made; it
                was to the Orimulsion-fired power stations in Denmark. I was not
                part of the delegation because I had been there previously, but
                I can verify the Committee’s findings on the efficiency and
                the high environmental standards of that plant in Zealand.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Indeed, on my visit, we quizzed the
                representatives of green organisations. I do not mean the SDLP
                but groups such as Friends of the Earth, the World Wildlife
                Fund, and so on and their equivalents in Denmark. Having
                investigated emissions from that plant and having examined the
                programme that was established to deal with spillage, those
                groups were extremely happy with the work going on at the plant,
                and they gave it their seal of approval. If Kilroot were
                converted to dual-fired Orimulsion and oil burning, it could go
                a long way to bridging the gap between generation costs in this
                part of the UK and in England, Scotland and Wales.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am glad that the Minister kept the door
                open to the Committee’s recommendation, and indeed, this is
                perhaps the one issue over which the Committee almost came to
                blows. From memory, the only two issues on which it disagreed
                were the name of Londonderry and whether the use of Orimulsion
                should go ahead at Kilroot. Both engendered a great deal of heat
                and required much energy, but they were both resolved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The triple lock offered by the Committee
                gives the Minister a way forward to deal with this difficult
                issue — and there is no getting away from it, it is a complex
                matter — but it also ensures that the highest possible
                environmental standards will apply.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, the Committee said that the use of
                Orimulsion should be subject to a planning application, which
                is, of course, only right. That planning application would be
                the subject of an inquiry or a similar mechanism that would
                allow the public to air their views. Secondly, the strictest of
                environmental impact assessments should be carried out in
                public, which will enable the public to see exactly what
                measurements are taken, what statistics are used and how the
                consultants arrive at their conclusions on the environmental
                issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Particulates and spillage are the two
                remaining unresolved, yet crucial, issues. There is no doubt
                that the conversion to Orimulsion burning will lead to a major
                reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from Kilroot. Sulphur
                emissions, when combined with flue-gas desulphurisation plant,
                will fall appreciably. Therefore, we have a win-win situation as
                far as oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and oxides of sulphur (SOx), as
                they are called, and emission gases are concerned. However,
                questions remain about the fine particulate matter, cadmium and
                vanadium, as well as about the other particulates that can cause
                some respiratory problems. With flue-gas desulphurisation and
                electrostatic precipitation it is possible to eliminate the
                majority of those particulates from the atmosphere. However,
                there are remaining concerns about that, and the environmental
                impact assessment must examine it in detail.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">More crucially perhaps, although only 11 or
                12 tankers a year are likely to come to Kilroot from Venezuela,
                we must ask what would happen if any of those were to sink in
                Belfast harbour or along the coast of Northern Ireland. The
                environmental impact assessment must examine in detail any
                contingency plans to deal with that should it ever occur.
                Therefore, the second lock is the environmental impact analysis.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thirdly, the Assembly should make any
                decision on the production of power, because this is an
                important regional issue that, given those three provisos,
                should be taken seriously. In the response to the report, the
                door has been left open for that proposal. I came to the
                proposed use of Orimulsion with a cynical and jaundiced
                viewpoint. My impression was that Orimulsion was the last thing
                we needed in Northern Ireland. However, when I considered the
                facts, the use of Orimulsion elsewhere and read the literature,
                I concluded that there was merit in considering the proposal.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr McDonnell raised the issue of the lack of
                legislation to provide a low-cost borrowing mechanism to reduce
                the real cost to the consumer of the capital tied up in the
                power industry. A simple piece of primary legislation is needed,
                which some believe could be included in the energy Bill. It
                could be used to buy out the Ballylumford long-term generator
                contract.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee is examining the energy Bill,
                and some members are minded to suggest an amendment to allow
                that provision to be included, not as a mandatory provision but
                as enabling legislation that would allow a proposal to be
                considered. The Minister would not be compelled to do anything.
                It would be a question of &quot;may&quot; rather than
                &quot;shall&quot;. At least the provision would be there if a
                realistic proposal were put forward.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Dr McDonnell stated, in pure numerical
                terms the savings are small, one suggestion being that the
                figure would be between £1 million and £1·2 million. However,
                that saving, combined with tackling the long-term generator
                contracts, and perhaps moving to the use of Orimulsion, would go
                a long way to reducing the gap between Northern Ireland and the
                rest of the UK. If nothing else is achieved during the Minister’s
                short term of office, a series of steps would have been set in
                motion to bridge that gap and the Minister would have made a
                significant achievement for Northern Ireland. If the Assembly is
                to mean anything to the people of Northern Ireland, something
                has to be done on this crucial issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee for Enterprise, Trade and
                Investment is considering industrial derating, and some
                difficult decisions will have to be taken. Industrial derating
                was introduced because of the significant difference in
                electricity prices for industry in Northern Ireland. Many
                witnesses appearing before the Committee said that the abolition
                of industrial derating could not be justified until the problem
                of high electricity costs was addressed. There is much merit in
                that argument. That does not presuppose one or other decision on
                the matter, but the two elements are linked.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The energy issue is extraordinarily complex,
                and no one will pretend otherwise. However, the Committee’s
                report and the Minister’s response were a step in the right
                direction and, if we go forward together, many positive changes
                will be put in place for the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome most of the response and understand
                the reasons for saying &quot;no&quot; and &quot;perhaps&quot;.
                No matter how tactful those responses are, I understand that
                those decisions have to be made.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We will get a second bite at the cherry when
                we debate the energy Bill, and these issues will reappear many
                times. As far as the Assembly is concerned, the book on energy
                is far from closed.</p>

                Before I make my contribution to the debate, I send my
                congratulations to the Armagh team and the Derry minor team. I
                am being very parochial in relation to Armagh. It is

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thank you; that issue has been covered.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr O’Hagan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will not discuss all of the
                recommendations, as the report was substantial, and the response
                was very detailed. This is part of the continuing debate on
                energy, and I look forward to further discussion on the matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recommendation 2 deals with the consumer
                bond. In addition to Orimulsion, this issue exercised the
                members of the Committee a great deal. There is growing
                recognition that bonds could be an effective way of reducing
                prices. The matter certainly requires full public debate and
                consultation. It appears that people are increasingly coming
                around to the idea that bonds are a low-cost borrowing mechanism
                for energy. However, the proposal needs detailed examination,
                debate and consultation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recommendation 9 deals with eradicating fuel
                poverty. The revised framework for the energy efficiency levy
                must ensure openness and transparency with regard to how money
                is spent and the extent to which people are lifted out of fuel
                poverty. The eradication of fuel poverty must be considered from
                the inception of any scheme or project funded by the energy
                efficiency levy. The evaluation of the warm homes scheme will
                provide some valuable information on the levy contribution. We
                need a comprehensive, resource-based evaluation of the energy
                efficiency levy, and this should be formalised and implemented
                as quickly as possible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recommendation 10 concerns the establishment
                of a task force on fuel poverty. Although a fuel poverty
                strategy is very welcome, the Committee for Enterprise, Trade
                and Investment called for the task force in order to inject some
                political momentum into the situation. I would like to see that
                established as quickly as possible. The Assembly has
                demonstrated that there is cross-party support for tackling fuel
                poverty, but that needs to be harnessed and driven forward. The
                eradication of fuel poverty in the North of Ireland within 10
                years would be a testament to the Assembly’s work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recommendation 11 seeks greater transparency
                with regard to the use of the energy efficiency levy. For
                example, how does Northern Ireland Electricity (NIE) select
                projects to fund? What criteria are used? Are some organisations
                refused funding, and, if so, what happens to them? I would
                welcome clarity and openness on these matters. A panel of
                independent assessors could help NIE to assess projects.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recommendation 24, which deals with a
                renewable energy target, has already been mentioned. I would
                like to see a more vigorous response from the Department on the
                promotion of renewable energy. The Committee set a target of 15%
                of all electricity to come from renewable sources by 2010. That
                is not impossible, and it would help to drive a more vigorous
                project forward. I look forward to the implementation of the
                strategy and to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and
                Investment’s plans to promote renewable energy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recommendation 38 deals with the
                establishment of a renewable energy agency. I would like to see
                that done as soon as possible, in line with the Committee’s
                recommendation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to recommendation 45, the
                consultation on the abolition of the Government royalty tax is
                to be welcomed. However, all parties recognise the need for an
                all-Ireland energy market. One of the key issues —</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. Is
                it in order for the hon Member to mislead the Assembly? The
                recommendation refers to an all-island energy market, not an
                all-Ireland one. That is an important distinction, so what is

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not a member of the Committee for
                Enterprise, Trade and Investment, but energy issues are so
                important that we should all take an interest in them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A key issue in the report and the Minister’s
                response is that of relative energy charges, particularly in
                Great Britain and the rest of the European Union. Along with Dr
                McDonnell and Mr Wells, I argue that consideration should be
                given to permissive legislation for so-called low-cost borrowing
                mechanisms. Several billion pounds worth of capital is tied up
                in the energy industry, so a relatively small reduction in
                interest charges on loans — even by 0·1% — could lead to
                tens of millions of pounds worth of savings for customers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Primary legislation — for example, the
                forthcoming energy Bill — is needed to achieve that laudable
                objective. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment,
                through the regulator, could commit consumers to repay on loans.
                Given that there are approximately 600,000 electricity users in
                the Province, the lending institutions such as the banks would
                view that as better security, given the current risk, albeit
                unlikely, of Northern Ireland Electricity’s bankruptcy.
                Consequently, consumers could make savings, as the loan
                repayment would be at a lower interest rate. I understand that,
                in principle, the Confederation of British Industry and the
                Federation of Small Businesses support such permissive
                legislation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It might be argued that the systems operator
                could levy charges on customers within the framework of existing
                legislation. However, that would not be enough to satisfy the
                lending institutions. They need assurance, in the form of
                primary legislation, that consumers would ultimately repay
                loans. I commend the report and the ministerial response.
                However, we need to act now to lower electricity prices through,
                for example, permissive legislation to provide for a low-cost
                borrowing mechanism.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s response, which,
                for the large part, was positive. Most of the 45 recommendations
                fall within his remit.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recommendation 14 relates to the Coolkeeragh
                development. As regards its support and implementation, all the
                necessary statutory consent for the construction of a combined
                cycle gas turbine station has been granted. The projected
                commissioning date for the project is autumn 2004.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On 12 February 2002, the regulator granted a
                gas conveyance licence to Bord Gáis Éireann for the
                construction of a gas pipeline to supply the new generation
                station and downstream markets along the route of the pipeline.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The new power station will act as an anchor
                customer for the new natural gas pipeline to the North and
                northwest. Over 80,000 new domestic gas connections, including
                the city of Derry, Limavady, Ballymena, Antrim and Letterkenny,
                could be made possible in the years after the construction of
                the gas pipeline, facilitated by the power station.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Developing the power plant at Coolkeeragh
                will enhance economic activity in the north-west. The
                development of the new power station represents an inward
                investment of £150 million in the region, bringing jobs and
                other benefits. It will provide 600 jobs at the peak of the
                construction phase, and there will be 40 secure jobs in running
                the station when it has been built. The local economy is set to
                benefit significantly from the power plant development at
                Coolkeeragh. To facilitate local companies being given the
                opportunity to supply products and service to the main
                contractor, a unique supplier model initiative supported by
                Invest Northern Ireland and delivered by North West Marketing
                has been developed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the report but, as I have a little
                time left, I would also like to commend recommendation 9 on
                eradicating fuel poverty. The energy efficiency levy is to be
                increased to £5 per customer. I also commend recommendation 10
                on the setting up of the task force on fuel poverty. The
                Department for Social Development is already advancing the fuel
                poverty strategy. Recommendation 15 relates to the climate
                change levy, which is a reserved matter. We already have a
                derogation for five years, and I appreciate the Minister’s
                assurance that he will seek a 10-year derogation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome very much recommendation 22 on
                waste minimalisation and the Minister’s positive response to
                it. Recommendations 39 and 40 deal with gas to the north-west
                and the postalisation of costs. The fact that costs will be
                evenly distributed to all gas consumers must be welcomed. I
                agree with Dr Birnie, Mr Wells, Dr O’Hagan and my Colleague,
                Dr McDonnell, who spoke in favour of recommendation 45 — its
                implementation would undoubtedly benefit all in the electricity
                market.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and
                Investment (Sir Reg Empey):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am grateful to the Committee for the
                motion, which will help to keep the extremely important question
                of energy high on the Assembly’s agenda. I have listened
                carefully to a very positive debate on energy, although I share
                Mr Wells’s disappointment that we did not attract more
                Members. This issue affects every household and business in the
                Province, so it should be high on the agenda. I will attempt to
                cover as many of the issues that were raised as possible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee Chairperson and many other
                Members spoke about renewable energy. I want to make it clear
                that the target has not yet been set. However, it will be set in
                the energy strategy, which will be published later in the year.
                I understand why the Committee feels strongly that we should
                have set a higher target, but Members are omitting one issue —
                most potential renewables will come from wind power. Mr
                Armstrong and others raised questions about biomass, anaerobic
                digesters and other forms of renewable energy. All have their
                place. However, if we are to reach a significant target of 10%
                or 15%, 95% of it will come from wind. That is the reality. We
                must also remember the huge cost involved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A figure of 15% would cost the consumer a
                further £40 million. That excludes the cost of upgrading the
                network to distribute that energy, and that could be as much
                again. Wind energy generators are usually located in isolated
                areas, and the existing network for wind energy is not equipped
                to deal with intermittent sources of energy supply and would
                have to be radically upgraded and changed at a huge cost to the
                consumer. Members must understand that there is a double cost
                involved: it may be more expensive to produce, and the high
                distribution costs must also be taken into account.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Department is committed to renewable
                energy. Mr Armstrong and other Members raised issues such as
                anaerobic digesters, and I am working closely with my Colleague
                in the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development to
                encourage such matters. However, it is not easy to set such a
                target. In any event, there is no point in setting a target that
                is not achievable, and I hope that can be avoided. Nevertheless,
                I take Members’ points very seriously, and I know how
                sincerely held their views are on the subject.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Virtually every Member referred to fuel
                poverty. The figure of 170,000 people below the fuel poverty
                line is, in this day and age, a disgrace. However, that is
                primarily a matter for my Colleague, the Minister for Social
                Development, and I will draw his attention to the points raised.
                I have had experience of fuel poverty in my constituency. The
                staggering fact is that even though we were offering, through
                the fuel poverty pilot scheme, to convert and insulate
                properties, to provide modern, efficient gas boilers and to give
                other advice, an enormous number of people did not apply for it.
                I found that disturbing. Home helps have to light fires for
                people who cannot manage solid fuel, and, even though the scheme
                was available in certain areas and people could get new
                equipment, homes insulated and free advice, there was still an
                insufficient number of applicants. That is shocking.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wells:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There were two schemes, one in the Beechmount
                area of west Belfast and one in Willowfield in the Minister’s
                constituency. The Beechmount scheme was incredibly successful
                with a very high take-up, but the Willowfield scheme was much
                less successful. However, that had more to do with the level of
                community organisation in the two areas rather than the
                attractiveness of the scheme.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Mr Speaker in the Chair)</p>
                </i><b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept that to a point. Nevertheless, even
                though significant efforts were made to draw the scheme to the
                attention of people in the area, I was disappointed with the
                take-up. I accept that we must all do more at community level.
                However, almost every Member has made the point about fuel
                poverty, and I will draw it to the attention of my Colleague.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Significant bids are being made in the
                Budget. The Minister for Social Development is bidding for
                substantial resources from the Northern Ireland block grant to
                back the increase in the OFREG levy. There is a real chance of
                making a significant difference on that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson referred to recommendation 27
                on local renewable energy plans and recommendation 28 on
                planning and building control bodies. Again, some of those
                matters are the concern of the Department of the Environment,
                and I will draw Mr Nesbitt’s attention to them as many Members
                found them significant.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Neeson, Dr Birnie, Dr McDonnell and other
                Members raised the issue of the bonds. I am aware of the
                problem, and I am looking at it closely. A range of issues must
                be considered, including tax and state aid issues. However,
                Members have made it clear that they intend to raise the matter
                during the passage of the Bill. As the Executive approved the
                Bill at their meeting last week, we hope, with your permission,
                Mr Speaker, to introduce it this month. It will then move to
                Committee Stage, when Members will be able to discuss its
                provisions at some length — we shall see where that leads us.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Neeson and other Members also referred to
                the high cost of electricity. I have now had two meetings with
                Sir George Quigley, one the week before last and one some months
                ago. I am acutely aware of all the major issues, and I assure
                the Member that not a week goes by without our trying to address
                them in the Department. They are very difficult and complex, and
                we shall continue to work at them, for each half point that we
                can shave off the cost is of advantage to the people of Northern
                Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Neeson also referred to diversification; I
                am aware of the percentage of our electricity that we shall
                eventually produce with gas when Coolkeeragh comes on-stream and
                when the new combined cycle gas turbine starts to work. Of
                course, that will be a much more efficient form of generation;
                we shall use less gas at Ballylumford when the new power station
                opens than we use with the present facilities because of
                increased efficiency. Coolkeeragh, as Mrs Courtney is well
                aware, is a state-of-the-art, highly efficient combined cycle
                gas turbine. I am aware of Mr Neeson’s point, but at least now
                we have the interconnector. There is also interconnection with
                the Republic, so we are not as isolated as we used to be, and
                that is of significant satisfaction to us.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr McDonnell spoke about the all-island
                market. Of course, a population of five million is a small
                market for energy, and we all know that. That is why
                interconnection, both North/South and east-west, gives us a
                platform upon which we can play more effectively. We are working
                very closely with the regulators both North and South, who meet
                monthly. The two Departments have a high-level working group,
                and we had a report in 2001. These reports are accessible on our
                Department’s web site, and one can see there what we are
                doing. The market is opening up because of the interconnection
                with Great Britain.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That brings us neatly to the nuclear option
                to which Mr Wells referred. He used some cricketing analogies,
                and at one stage he was in danger of putting us in some doubt
                about how he ever got married; but someone must have said
                &quot;Yes&quot; to him at some stage. We have an interconnection
                with Great Britain, and the electricity that flows through that
                interconnector can come from various sources, including the
                south of Scotland, which has access to nuclear plants.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not favour any such plants being built
                here, but Sellafield is of environmental importance to all of
                us, quite apart from the generation of electricity. There can be
                no guarantee of the source from which electricity comes when it
                passes through the interconnector; it is not possible to
                identify that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wells also raised the question of
                Orimulsion. As he says, we are keeping an open mind, but the
                Member should not forget the significant environmental issues
                with that fuel. It sinks when it enters water, and I am
                satisfied that he has no desire to tarmac the bottom of Belfast
                Lough. We should bear in mind that there is only one source of
                supply in a very unstable part of the world — there was an
                attempted coup d’état there some months ago, and we must all
                take account of that.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.45pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I know that he and other Committee
                members were impressed by their visit to Denmark. We shall
                examine any proposal that comes to us. Apart from the
                environmental issues, the change in the generating regime will
                require the consent of the Department. There are other options,
                such as coal, and a range of issues has been designed to reduce
                costs. We must take a view based on our regulatory position.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The debate has shown that the Committee has
                taken a consistent interest; it has done more work on energy
                than on any other heading in the portfolio. That is important,
                because the issue affects what is in people’s pockets and has
                an impact on our industrial competitiveness, which is a key area
                in which the Committee and the Department are engaged.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Together we are involved in evolving policy.
                I have been able to take on board several recommendations, and
                when the energy Bill goes to the Committee for consideration we
                shall examine the consumer issues, which Dr O’Hagan mentioned,
                and postalisation, which is a huge matter for all of us.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I know that Mr Neeson has been angered by the
                reactions that we received from some quarters. However, we can
                post a letter anywhere in the Province for the same price. Every
                unit of electricity is sold to consumers at the same price,
                wherever they are. The principle of postalisation is already
                established. Would it be fair to charge a consumer in south
                Fermanagh the real cost of electricity that is produced in Larne
                and transmitted from there? It would clearly cost more than it
                would for a consumer in Carrickfergus. It would be insane to go
                down that road. No part of the Province, especially the rural
                areas, could hope to survive under that sort of regime.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I earnestly hope that the Committee and the
                House will support the Bill’s postalisation element, because
                that is the only way to deliver what is, in cross-border terms,
                the largest single project that we have undertaken together
                since partition. I would like to think that that project could
                be delivered to benefit thousands of people in Northern Ireland
                who were denied access to fuel. We used to be the only region in
                western Europe with no gas supply to its main towns. I hope that
                we shall have support. I look forward to working with the
                Committee as the Bill proceeds, and I shall be keenly interested
                in the Committee’s responses and suggestions.</p>

                some detail later on, but his general contribution was very
                solid and recognised the work in which the Committee has been
                involved. The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee mentioned
                bonds, which is an issue with which we are still struggling at
                times, because a huge amount of money is involved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee has yet to conclude its views
                on bonds, but it was right that Mr Neeson should highlight that.
                Mr Neeson welcomed the work being done on the natural gas
                pipeline from South to North and the north-west, and he made
                some historical references to various all-party delegations that
                tried to bring it all about. He also made a clear reference to
                the need for postalisation and the work done by the Committee in
                dealing with the energy Bill.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Armstrong mentioned the benefits of
                turning waste into energy, which the Committee saw on its visit
                to Denmark. He also stressed the need for cheaper electricity
                and energy, and that was what helped the Committee initially to
                focus on energy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Every Member who spoke mentioned fuel
                poverty. Biogas is another notable source of renewables, and the
                energy savings that can be made by properly implementing
                building regulations were also mentioned.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr McDonnell spoke of the need for Members to
                debate energy constantly, such is its importance —
                particularly the cost of electricity and how to tackle it. He
                also referred to the ongoing discussions on bonds and their
                implications, and he had clear views on fuel poverty. There are
                170,000 households in Northern Ireland living in fuel poverty.
                Members spoke of the levy paid by each customer, and Mr Wells
                made detailed reference to how well spread the levy could be if
                Dr McDonnell paid a bit more than the rest of us. Given the
                number of people and the enormity of the suffering involved, a
                £5 levy per customer per annum is very little to ask, and it
                would eradicate fuel poverty in five years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly, the Committees and the
                Executive have been involved in many enormous projects that take
                a lot of strategic planning, time and money. However, the report
                states that another £1 million would wipe out fuel poverty in
                five years. That can be achieved; the money can be found. If the
                Exchequer will not give it, the Executive can surely find it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr McDonnell also mentioned renewable energy,
                the all-island market and the Moyle interconnector which links
                us up not only with Britain but with the wider EU, bringing
                about security of supply and the potential for reducing costs.
                He also referred to the privatisation of power stations; that
                subject spills over into the issue of bonds.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wells was concerned about the small
                turnout for the debate, but I think he answered his own question
                when he said that the energy issue is so complex that very few
                understand it. It has taken the Committee over a year to cover
                all the associated issues. The Committee jokes about Mr Neeson
                promising an easy inquiry that would last six weeks after
                completion of the economic inquiry. However, we are still at it.
                We may not be experts, but we are much more knowledgeable now
                than when we started.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wells &quot;praised&quot; the steady and
                positive response from the Minister and the Department, and
                referred to the Minister’s straight bat response. He also said
                that the Minister should have said that nuclear power would be
                used in Northern Ireland over his dead body.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wells elaborated on fuel poverty. He dealt
                in huge detail with Orimulsion and said that the debate on the
                matter was ongoing. He also talked about the triple-lock
                mechanism, and the Minister dealt with those concerns in his
                response. The Committee had a huge debate on that, but the door
                has been left open, as we have not yet made a decision on it. Mr
                Wells also discussed the buying out of electricity contracts,
                which is tied to the issue of bonds. He talked about industrial
                derating, which will come before the House soon, and the fact
                that the Committee was considering how it would deal with the
                matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr O’Hagan, after praising the Armagh team
                for its fine victory, talked about the Minister’s detailed
                response to the Committee’s report. She dwelt on the issue of
                consumer bonds and the need for a full debate. She elaborated on
                fuel poverty, the energy efficiency levy and the Committee’s
                target of generating 15% of electricity from renewable sources
                by 2010. Dr O’Hagan also mentioned recommendation 38 on the
                establishment of a renewable energy agency and recommendation
                45, which would enable companies to trade in a fair and
                equitable all-island energy market. She also welcomed the
                Department’s response to the Committee’s proposals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie talked about the low-cost borrowing
                mechanisms that are available and the need to conclude the
                debate on that issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Courtney expressed support for the
                Coolkeeragh project, about which the Committee has felt strongly
                since the beginning. She also spoke about the need for a fuel
                poverty task force.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have lost my notes on the Minister’s
                detailed response. He explained why it was difficult to push the
                target from 10% to 15%, outlining the cost factors, on which the
                Committee will reflect. The Committee was trying to put Northern
                Ireland at the cutting edge with renewable resources rather than
                leave it behind in the game with regard to European Directives
                and the activities of other countries.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand that aspects of fuel poverty
                related to other Ministries, but the issue could be resolved by
                means of a collective, all-embracing, cross-cutting response.
                Bonds and the cost-saving aspects of diversification were
                discussed. That reminded us that even an all-island market would
                be small and that energy could flow in more than one direction,
                for example, from an electricity interconnector linking us to
                Britain and the EU.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wells may have been told that nuclear
                plants were an option, but the Minister rejected that
                possibility. However, he highlighted the fact that he could not
                determine from which source energy would be manufactured. The
                Minister responded to the question of Orimulsion, and it will
                feed into the Committee’s thorough deliberations. We have had
                a lively debate on energy, and no doubt we shall return to the
                issue.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. Just in case the Member finds his
                notes, I draw his attention to the fact that only three minutes
                remain.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Doherty:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Two minutes will suffice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister recognised the Committee’s
                work, for which I thank him, and also how the Committee worked
                with the Department. It was an example of the right way for a
                Committee and Department to work together. The Committee did its
                best in that regard, because the issue is so serious. I was glad
                that the Minister said that the principle of postalisation has
                long been established.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The debate has been useful, although, as Jim
                Wells said, it was a pity that more Members were not present.
                However, as we continue to debate and promote the issues, and
                especially as the Committee scrutinises the draft Bill,
                everything will be dealt with.</p>
