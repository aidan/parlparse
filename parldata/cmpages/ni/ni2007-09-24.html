	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The Assembly met at 12.00 noon (Mr Speaker in the  Chair).</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><span class="H4StageHeading"><a name="1"></a></span>Assembly Business</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Retirement of the Clerk to the Assembly</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong><span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt; ">Mr Speaker</span></strong>: On behalf of the Assembly Commission, I inform the House that,  since we last met, I have received a letter from the Clerk to the Assembly, Mr  Arthur Moir, in which he conveyed his decision to <span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; ">retire from his position and return to a legal consultancy</span> role  in the Northern Ireland Civil Service.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Arthur has served in the position of Clerk and Chief  Executive since 2001. For much of that time, he was tasked with maintaining the  Assembly secretariat and our facilities in a state of readiness for  restoration. The challenges of doing so over  such a prolonged period were considerable, and Members must be grateful  to him for ensuring that we were able to resume full business immediately on  restoration.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; ">Members will be aware  that a review of the Assembly</span> secretariat is under way. In his letter to  me, Arthur has anticipated that the review is likely to recommend a significant  programme of reform and restructuring that will  last several years. Mindful that he had not intended to serve in his  current position for such a period, it was his view that retiring from his post  at this time would allow the Assembly Commission to appoint a new Clerk and Chief Executive to oversee through to  fruition the full programme of change.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt; ">In my own opinion, such  concern for the best interests</span> of  the Assembly and its secretariat is typical of our Clerk, whose service to the House has been marked at all  times by commit&shy;ment, loyalty and integrity. I know that Members will  wish to express their gratitude to him and will have an opportunity to do so at  a later date.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Looking ahead, the Commission is taking firm steps to  ensure continuity of service to the Assembly while the process of appointing a new Clerk is undertaken, and I will  write to Members once appropriate arrangements have been put in place.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading"><a name="2"></a>Members&rsquo; Participation in Debates / Ministerial  Statements<span style="font-size:10.5pt; font-weight:normal; "> </span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  During the business of this House on 18 September 2007, Mr Dominic Bradley  raised a point of order. He referred to the involvement of Members in a debate  when those Members had not been present for all of that debate. Mr Bradley  thought that that was inconsistent with his not being called to ask a question  following a ministerial statement, after he had missed the start of that  statement.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">At this stage, I want to point out that the regular  business of the House is different to that of ministerial statements. I would  not expect any Member to sit through the entire day&rsquo;s business &mdash; I understand  that Members have other work to do. There will be a ministerial statement later  this morning, so, once again I must emphasise the principle and the convention  to be observed with regard to ministerial statements.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If Members who have been present in the Chamber to hear all  of the statement wish to ask questions, I will seek to ensure that they can do  so. If Members have been in the Chamber for part of the statement, and if there  is sufficient time left, I shall allow them to put their questions. However,  those Members will not be called before the Members who have been present for  the entire statement. The Chair will try to accommodate as many Members as  possible.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is attendance in the Chamber that counts; it does not  matter that Members may have been listening to the statement elsewhere. Some Members have indicated that they  have heard a ministerial statement in their rooms and that that should be  enough to allow them to rush to the House to ask questions. That will not  happen. If Members wish to ask questions, they must be present in the Chamber  to hear the full statement.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that I have made clear the difference between the  day-to-day business of the House and ministerial statements.</p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="3"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Workplace 2010</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have received notice from the Minister of Finance and Personnel that he  wishes to make a statement on Workplace 2010 and the location of public-sector  jobs.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel (Mr P Robinson)</strong>: I want to make a statement on a  couple of issues of interest that were considered at the last Executive  meeting. The first of those is the Workplace 2010  contract, which, because of its nature, has courted some controversy,  and I shall come on to that shortly. The second issue, and one that is in some  ways linked, is the ongoing debate on the location of public-sector jobs. Both  of those matters, certainly during my time as Minister of Finance and  Personnel, have generated intense interest and speculation about how and where  we accommodate civil servants.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members could be forgiven for thinking that something as  dry as Civil Service accommodation would hardly be the stuff that headlines are  made of and would not make for particularly riveting reading. However, those  projects have grabbed the attention of many people for a whole host of reasons.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased to report that, on what have been very  difficult issues for all the parties on the Executive Committee, we have  fashioned the way forward in such a way  that the Executive have agreed unanimously that both projects should  proceed to the next stage.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive&rsquo;s ability to agree on the handling of  Workplace 2010 and job dispersal demonstrates the foolishness of claims that  the Executive are avoiding taking difficult decisions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to address some concerns directly. First, the fact  that we are proposing to deliver Workplace 2010 through PFI procurement has  caused considerable debate. Secondly, there is concern that the PFI contract  will in some way consolidate the Civil Service in Belfast and thus restrict any future movement  of business. Thirdly, concerns have been raised about what will happen to the  500 civil servants who are employed in estate and property-related work.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those are the matters that have been at the heart of the  debate, rather than the estate itself, so it was important, when coming to  conclusions, that Ministers, including myself, were able to consider them  before making decisions to proceed, and it was for that reason that I submitted  papers to the Executive seeking their approval.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Towards the end of the next stage, I intend to bring the  details of the contract back to Ministers for further consideration, but I  firmly believe that this is a good example  of how, as an Executive, we have demonstrated that we are prepared to  take on, and come to consensus on, the big issues.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I shall start with  Workplace 2010, which, for Members who are less familiar with the  detail, is a proposed PFI contract that  would enable some 77 Civil Service office buildings to be transferred to  a private sector partner who would be responsible for upgrading about 15 of the  core properties at a cost of about &pound;100 million. In taking over the buildings,  the private sector would also be responsible for maintaining and servicing them  during the period of the contract.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When I became Minister of Finance and Personnel, the competitive process to find the most suitable  private-sector partner was well advanced &mdash; the Department had already  shortlisted Land Securities Trillium and Telereal from four bidders who had  initially submitted proposals.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><span style="letter-spacing:-.25pt; ">The question for the  Executive and for me was whether</span> the procurement, which is worth about  &pound;1&middot;5 billion, should proceed. Is it right for Northern Ireland? Is it right for  the Government?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Some commentators who take a very superficial view of  matters have, for example, suggested that we are selling off the family silver.  Well, some of that is very tarnished  silver. We are not talking about buildings of great historical or  cultural interest. We are talking about office blocks and Portakabins, some of  which are well past their sell-by dates and in urgent need of attention.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the greater Belfast area, for example,  we are dealing with 18 buildings that are owned by the Government, and,  of those, 14 will be either demolished or vacated once the refurbishment  programme is complete. That gives some idea of the state of the buildings that  we are talking about, and that situation is not sustainable for reasons of  efficiency and the conditions in which some people are working.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Ironically, the best of the accommodation is already  leased, so the idea of the Civil Service renting from the private sector is by no means new. Seventeen  leaseholds will transfer in Belfast,  and we will continue to occupy most of them for the lifetime of the contract.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In summary, we have an estate that needs major investment  to bring it up to scratch and provide better working conditions that will drive  improvements in the delivery of services, which, ultimately, is what the public  sector is in business to do.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Since doing nothing is not an option, we have had to  consider how those improvements should be funded, and the amount of money that  we need is simply not available to us. Having looked at various procurement  options, we have concluded that the financial case for PFI gives us best value  for money. To put it simply, the 77 buildings cost us about &pound;70 million each year,  and that allows us only to tread water.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Workplace 2010 contract will see the successful private  sector partner investing about &pound;100 million in improving the accommodation. We  will have a contractual guarantee that the estate will be maintained and  serviced to a good standard for the next 20 years or so, and all that will be  done for broadly the same amount of money that we are spending at present.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As things stand, we can also expect to get a capital payment in the region of &pound;200 million to help fund  other projects such as roads, hospitals and schools during the  comprehensive spending review period.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, by selling the &ldquo;tarnished silver&rdquo;, we will be  provided with quality, polished silver to use and the money to buy new, valuable and urgently needed assets. It is a  very attractive deal, and it is absolutely essential if we are serious about  proceeding with the priorities in our investment strategy. That said, we  nonetheless need to be assured that the contract represents value for money.  The financial case shows that, as things stand, the PFI contract is hundreds of  millions of pounds cheaper than traditional procure&shy;ment, but it is important  that appropriate safeguards be put in place.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On that subject, the Committee for Finance and Personnel has been particularly helpful. The  Committee has produced a report that majors on value for money, based on  the experience and evidence of other PFI projects. It has, quite rightly,  subjected the project to a rigorous examination and proposed a number of  recommendations, which I have accepted and which will provide the necessary  assurances to my ministerial colleagues, and to the Assembly, that value for  money is being delivered.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Related to the subject of value for money is the issue of  the value of the estate, and the concern that the Government could have their  eye wiped by a private-sector partner intent on making excessive profits at our  expense. I have been able to say to other Ministers and to the Committee that  the Department has looked in some detail at the structure of other deals. It  has also looked at what the Public Accounts Committee and the Northern Ireland  Audit Office have had to say about other deals, and a commercial approach has  been developed that will ensure that Civil Service interests are protected. The  approach that we are taking will realise best value as and when sites are  released and will optimise the share of any profits. We have also assured the  Committee that the outcome of an independent valuation exercise will be taken into  account in the final contract.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As I have already said, a key concern for staff and the  unions is the impact of that contract on the people who are employed in estate- and property-related work. If we are  to transfer the estate and all the associated functions, the question arises  about what happens to the staff, many of whom are messengers and support-grade  staff who want to remain in the Civil Service. Therefore, although we are clear  that the transfer of functions such as reception and security services makes  good financial sense, we are determined to ensure that any staff who want to  remain in the Civil Service have the opportunity to do so.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We have done that by  introducing a process whereby messengers and support staff can, for the  first time, transfer to main&shy;stream Civil Service jobs, with the opportunity to  follow a career path that previously was not available to them. Over three  quarters of the 300 staff involved have applied to transfer to administrative  jobs, and the feedback to date has been very positive. As a result, I have been  able to assure Ministers that there will be no compulsory transfers to the  private sector, and the Executive have unanimously agreed that that should  indeed be the case.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In my opening remarks, I said that concerns had been raised  that the contract would restrict our capacity to relocate jobs in future. In  the context of Workplace 2010, the Department is working on the basis that the  contract must be flexible enough to accommodate future movement of business,  whether that be for political or operational  reasons. This is where we start to stray into the wider issue of the  location of public-sector jobs, so, at this stage, I should perhaps move on to  address that particular piece of work.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As I have said before, our public sector is too large,  given the overall size of the economy in Northern Ireland. We must build the  private sector. However, at the same time, I recognise the critical role played  by public servants. I also recognise that decisions around the future location  of public-sector jobs could have important implications for communities  throughout Northern Ireland.  Decisions will have to be taken about where the new bodies created as a result  of the review of public administration (RPA) will be based. We also need to think  about the longer term.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I, therefore, asked the Executive on 13 September to agree to a two-pronged approach. First, we shall  develop a framework that will provide a robust process for decision-making on the location of RPA-related  bodies. Secondly, we will undertake a time-bound review of policy on the  location of public-sector jobs in Northern Ireland. Again, I am  pleased to say that the Executive have agreed to that approach.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is a need to create a coherent and integrated  framework to underpin decisions on the location of RPA-related bodies. I am  talking about the decisions on the permanent location of bodies such as the new  Northern Ireland library authority and the education and  skills authority. The framework will help to ensure that the decisions that are  made about the location of those new bodies will be well informed and soundly  based.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the spring, the  Department of Finance and Personnel consulted on the proposed framework.  It invited views on the proposed guiding  principles in order that decisions that  result from the RPA on the location of public-sector jobs could be  underpinned. Not surprisingly, the consultation attracted strong interest, and  there were many helpful responses.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As I mentioned earlier, since then the Committee for Finance and Personnel has published the document  &lsquo;First Report on Workplace 2010 and Location of Public Sector Jobs&rsquo;.  That report included several constructive recommendations on the proposed  framework. The framework will broadly follow the approach that the consultation  document proposed, with amendments to reflect both the Committee&rsquo;s report and  consultees&rsquo; responses.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Alongside the guiding principles, there will be a detailed  methodology as to how the principles should be applied to help to ensure  openness and robustness throughout the decision-making process. Given that the  Executive have now agreed the framework, we will work towards publishing it later in the autumn. Although the  framework will provide a robust methodology for making decisions on the  location of the RPA-related bodies, we will  also need to think about the longer term.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is no extant proactive dispersal policy in Northern Ireland.  To date, dispersal has relied on taking advantage of opportunities as they  arose in cases in which value for money could be demonstrated. In an  Adjournment debate in the summer, I quoted figures on the location of  public-sector jobs. As those figures illustrated, the picture on the location  of those jobs is complex, as are the issues on the costs and benefits of dispersal.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The wide spectrum of opinion and the complexity of location  were also reflected in the responses to the consultation. For example, as  expected, dispersal was one of the key themes to emerge in the analysis of the  consultation responses. Several respondents favoured a proactive policy of  dispersal of public-sector jobs from the Belfast  area. Other respondents, although they acknowledged that a well-managed  relocation policy could bring a more even spread of benefits of public-sector  employment opportunities across Northern Ireland, also emphasised the critical  role that Belfast plays in driving the Northern Ireland economy. They also pointed to the many areas of deprivation in Belfast. Overall,  however, most respondents expressed a desire for greater clarity and openness  on the policy of the location of public-sector jobs.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for Finance and Personnel&rsquo;s report called for  an affirmative policy on the dispersal of public-sector jobs. It stated that  that policy should be complemented by a cross-cutting strategy on job location,  covering the Northern Ireland Civil Service, local government, and the wider  public sector. Taking all that into account, I, therefore, believe that it is  important that the location of public-sector jobs receives proper, detailed  consideration. For that reason, I proposed initiating a time-bound review of  policy on the location of public-sector jobs in Northern Ireland to enable the  Executive to come to an agreed approach on location policy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Ministers have supported that review, and I have agreed  shortly to introduce to the Executive further detailed proposals on the terms  of reference for the review and who might undertake it. Although the details of  the review require further consideration, it is important that it be independent and chaired by someone who is  experienced in the public sector and respected in the community. The review  would be time-bound and would also include a detailed cost-benefit analysis of the dispersal of public-sector jobs in Northern Ireland.  The review would also examine decentralisation policies and their  implementation in other jurisdictions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Initiating a detailed, time-bound review on location  policy, alongside introducing a robust framework to facilitate location  decisions for RPA-related bodies, provides a practical way forward. In the  context of Workplace 2010, I am content that the final contract should reflect  any decision on a dispersal policy that the Executive might make following the  review.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I need to bring to Members&rsquo; attention one final point on  Workplace 2010. The Executive have agreed that the procurement of the contract  should now proceed to best-and-final-offer stage. However, that is subject to a  court injunction on the procurement being  lifted. Unfort&shy;unately, during the summer, one of the unsuccessful  bidders filed a legal challenge on the basis of belief that his or her bid was  evaluated unfairly and irrationally. Given that the Department believes that  there is no case to answer on the fairness and integrity of the process, suffice  it for me to say that it does not accept that claim and will vigorously defend  itself.</p>
	      <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Dallat] in the Chair)</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As things stand, an  injunction is in place that prohibits the Department from inviting best  and final offers from the two remaining bidders. That injunction is due to be  reviewed at a hearing on 11 October, when I can assure Members that the Department will be strongly opposing any  extension on the grounds that any further delay will substantially prejudice the project. There is, there&shy;fore,  likely to be a bit of a hiatus until the injunction issue can be resolved and,  as yet, I cannot give any guarantees as to how long that will take.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the meantime, I am grateful to Ministers from all  parties for their support and I will, naturally, update the Assembly on  progress in due course.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and Personnel (Mr Storey)</strong>: On  behalf of the Committee for Finance and Personnel, I thank the Minister for his  statement. I welcome the Department&rsquo;s positive  response to the Committee&rsquo;s report on Workplace 2010 and the location of public-sector jobs. The Com&shy;mittee has  proposed a take-note debate on its report and the Department&rsquo;s response. That  debate will provide a further opportunity for the House to consider the matters  that have been set out today.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In that context, I ask the Minister when further  information on the proposed review of policy on jobs location will be available  to the Committee. I refer, in particular, to  the scope, terms of reference and timetable for the review. Is the  Minister minded to bring that information to the Committee before its  presentation to the Executive?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I thank the Committee for its work on its report on Workplace 2010, and for the  views that it has expressed on job location.  I welcome the take-note debate that the Committee hopes to propose.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As for the Member&rsquo;s question on the timetable for the  review, the Department is currently considering a number of matters, including  which person or persons should carry out the review. As I indicated in my  statement, we are looking for someone who will be respected in the community  and who has some considerable experience in the relevant area of activity. I  imagine &mdash; if I have to make a fist of it &mdash; that we will probably bring those  recommendations to the Executive in the next four to six weeks.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Of course, I will ensure, before going to the Executive, that  I have the advantage of hearing the views of the Committee. That will be  important and beneficial. The Committee will be part of the process.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his detailed statement.  I too welcome the review. Given the concerns that the Minister outlined  about the implications for the long-term equitable dispersal of public-sector  jobs across the Six Counties, will the flexibility of the Civil Service estate  be restricted by long-term contracts with the private sector?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Given the direct linkage between Workplace 2010 and the relocation of public-sector jobs, will  the Minister guarantee that there will be a clear and direct link  between Workplace 2010 and the equitable dispersal of public sector and Civil  Service jobs?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I am aware of the concerns that many people have expressed. I have managed to  travel around the country and hear people&rsquo;s views on the matter. People who  live west of the Bann will, I hope, see  that, in the past, I have always encouraged develop&shy;ment in that region.  I did that in the Department for Regional Development, and I can assure the  Member that, when it comes to the dispersal of public-sector jobs, I will do  the same in the Department of Finance and Personnel.  However, the final contract will be sufficiently flexible to allow us  room to manoeuvre, whatever the Executive might decide on dispersal policy.  Indeed, that contract will come to the Executive before they sign off on the  final private-sector partner.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As for linkages, the Member will already be aware that I  have made it very clear in my remarks today, and in the way that they were  presented to the Executive, that the matters are linked. For legal reasons, the  only contractual similarity between the two  is that flexibility on job dispersal will be built into the contract,  which will allow the Executive to make decisions based on the new policy.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  The Minister spoke of selling tarnished silver.  Does he acknowledge that there is some sparkling silver among the 77  buildings proposed for the sell-off &mdash; I am  thinking, in particular, about the jobs and benefits offices that have  been modernised at a cost of tens of millions of pounds in recent years?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Does he also acknowledge that, contrary to public opinion, there are constituencies in the east of Nor<span style="letter-spacing:0pt; ">thern Ireland</span>, such as my East Antrim  constituency, which have the lowest number of Civil Service jobs? Will he  ensure that the lack of significant numbers of Civil Service jobs in eastern  constituencies will be taken into account in any policy to disperse those jobs?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I am aware that some offices have been refurbished and that approximately &pound;50  million has been spent on that refurbishment. However, we need to be very clear  that the proposed contract will ensure that those offices stay in that state  for the next 20 years. The requirements are very clear.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is not simply a case of sale and lease-back &mdash; whereby  one finds oneself in the position of selling property and leasing it back again  from a private-sector landlord. In this case, we will have a contract, which  will require the private-sector landlord to keep those properties, and the  management of those properties, at the highest of standards.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As far as Civil Service jobs in East   Antrim are concerned, I made  the point that that issue is complicated. I remember teasing one of the Members for West Tyrone during an adjournment debate that in examining  travel-to-work areas in relation to public-sector jobs &mdash; and comparing  the jobs of 100 economically active people in  an area &mdash; Omagh was the highest in Northern Ireland, and Larne was  probably the worst.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is not just as simple as dispersing all the jobs to the  west. Areas inside the Belfast travel-to-work  area, but outside the heart of Belfast,  can, in many ways, be seen to be in more  difficulty than those west of the Bann.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  welcome the review of Civil Service jobs  and the fact that the Minister has said in his state&shy;ment, and in an  earlier answer, that the outcome of the policy  will be reflected in the final contract. Elsewhere, I believe the  Minister, in making his decision on the matter, referred to it as a  &ldquo;no-brainer&rdquo;. That is a rather risky phrase  to use in view of a previous decision, which another Minister also  referred to as a &ldquo;no-brainer&rdquo;. I hope that for the Minister&rsquo;s sake, and ours,  the phrase does not come back to haunt him.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are legitimate concerns about PFI contracts because  there have been situations here and in Great Britain in which, in the end,  the public interest has not been served  well by PFI contracts and private contractors have done extremely well.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">What real assurances can the Minister offer the Assembly  and the public that this PFI contract will work in the public interest?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I am grateful to the Member for his earlier remarks. Although there are  examples such as Balmoral High School &mdash; which comes into the conversation each  time someone talks about PFI &mdash; to some extent it is those examples that will  help us in relation to this contract, because we have learned from all  experiences, good and bad, elsewhere in Northern Ireland and throughout the  United Kingdom.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department has taken all those good and bad experiences  on board; and the Committee for Finance and Personnel particularly noted that  valuation and value-for-money issues should be considered carefully during this  exercise. That has been done.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">All I can say is  that we have learned from the experiences of others, and, on the basis  of the changes that we have made, and  throughout the process, we have considerably improved the contract. If  it were simply a case of our going for the greatest possible amount of capital,  the contract would be very different to the one that we have, which builds in  flexibility and safeguards to ensure that public interest will be taken into  account.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Like others, I thank the Minister for his statement.  Is there any logic in deferring the final contract for Workplace 2010 so  that the more cost-effective and efficient  results of the dispersal strategy will be in place, rather than seeking  contract variations down the line?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">With respect to  dispersal, does the Minister recognise that, at the moment, Bangor is the only town  that will lose jobs? Does he recognise that  that negative dispersal will impact on the local economy&rsquo;s  sustainability and is opposed by the local  workforce? What are the current plans for the Rathgael House site?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I have attempted to bring forward two sets of proposals in parallel &mdash; Workplace  2010 and the location of Civil Service jobs. The dispersal policy will proceed,  and I have outlined the timescale, so I  imagine that the Executive will have a clear picture of that policy.  Therefore, a backcloth will be in place when Workplace 2010 contracts are  signed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As far as Bangor is concerned, I  have met the Member for North Down  and the previous Mayor of North Down, his predecessor. The Department of  Finance and Personnel wishes to be located in the Stormont estate &mdash; at the moment, our staff are located in approximately  20 buildings around Northern    Ireland, which is not an efficient or  effective way to operate. The Department is continuing to seek the views of the  Department of Education about remaining in Bangor or moving. Therefore, no final  decision has been made on the issue. I am aware of the impact that job losses  will have to North Down and of the views of  those currently employed in Rathgael House.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement. I am sure that a common-sense solution  will be found with regard to Rathgael House.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is particularly welcome that the debate has not  descended into parochialism. Indeed, I commend the selfless attitude of the Member for West Belfast  opposite, who seemed keen on maximum dispersal, taking jobs out of her  own constituency and dispersing them to the west of the Province.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister believe that the legal challenge to  Workplace 2010 from the unsuccessful bidder will cause any delay to its  implementation?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I hope that when we &mdash; eventually &mdash; announce the policy on Rathgael House, Mr  Weir will agree that it is a common-sense approach. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">One argument for the importance of Belfast is not simply  that it is the capital &mdash; and there is a view that the main headquarters should  be in the Belfast area &mdash; but that the many areas of deprivation in the Belfast  area must be taken into account in the dispersal policy, just as the Member for  East Antrim pointed out the needs of the travel-to-work area outside Belfast.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to the legal challenge, I can honestly say to  the Member that the courts did not choose to deal with the matter; it was  brought to the courts. Therefore, the courts are in no way to blame. There is a  case before the courts, so I shall be very careful of what I say; however, it  is right to point out that we are already being held back. At their meeting on  13 September, the Executive took the decision to go to the best-and-final-offer  stage.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department could have come to the Assembly immediately after that, but held off because the  court was hearing the case last week. Therefore, the Department is  already being held back, which has implications for resources and capital under  the CSR. That is one of the difficulties  that the Department faces in introducing the Investment Strategy for Northern Ireland  2 and Budget proposals. We need to know the  amount of funding that will be available during the course of the CSR.  Such a large sum of money will have serious implications for the number of roads, hospitals and educational buildings  that can be constructed. All those issues must be dealt with in a short period.  Therefore, the court case is preventing the Department from taking such  decisions and introducing its Budget.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s  statement, in which he pre-empted a question that I had tabled to ask him later  during Question Time.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister  acknowledged deep political and social concerns about PFI. His statement  went some way to attempt to alleviate some of those concerns. I note that the  Executive have agreed to move on the next stage of the process by deciding that  the final contracts be presented for  approval. I assume that those contracts will guarantee to protect the  public purse and expenditure.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">To be fair, the recent Committee for Finance and Personnel  and Public Accounts Committee reports pointed out where past mistakes were  made; and the Minister highlighted the example of Balmoral High School,  which the Public Accounts Committee is examining. Recently, the Minister made a  speech about the Public Accounts Committee. I take the opportunity to assure the Minister that the Public Accounts  Committee exists not only to shine the light on mistakes, but to show  the way forward to Departments or the private sector, so that they can avoid  repeating those mistakes. Can the Minister  assure me that, when the final contracts are produced, lessons will have  been learned from all past mistakes to ensure that Members who stand in the  Assembly 10 years from now are not talking about another PFI disaster?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I am not sure how many Members will still be here in 10 years. However, we must  learn from past mistakes and avoid making new ones. All that the Executive can  do is give their best effort, using their skills, expertise and the experiences  of others, to take the correct decisions, and I am confident that we will do  that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member mentioned that I had pre-empted a question that he intended to ask me later during  Question Time. I am sure that that  will not deter him from thinking up a new question on the same subject.  It is important to remember that the  contract is a substantial one worth some &pound;1&middot;5 billion and the Department  must get it right. We are seized of that  importance and have half a notion of things that have gone wrong in the  past. We must ensure that we will not be in  a future position of having to explain why we did not act as we should  have. We are aware of all the future implications and impact of Workplace 2010.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I acknowledge the valuable work of the Public Accounts  Committee, and I am glad that the Member  follows so avidly the speeches that I make around the country. However,  during the speech to which he referred, to the Confederation of British Industry, I simply pointed out that the  innovation and new thinking of civil  servants should not be curtailed by  pillorying them every time they get something wrong. To ensure that  innovation is not stifled, there must be some balance in the consideration of  such matters.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McQuillan</strong>: I thank the Minister for his statement. If Workplace 2010 were  not to proceed in line with the current timescale, what would be the  implications for the capital budget of Northern Ireland?</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">12.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  That would depend on the extent to which Workplace 2010 does not meet the  timetable. The Executive will bring forward  a draft Budget during October/November.  A sum of &pound;200 million would leave a  sizeable hole in the capital spend if it were not available to us. If that sum is not available when we bring  forward the three-year comprehensive spending review, but becomes  available after that, the Executive could make speedy adjustments. However,  that would affect the planning for our investment strategy.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Will the Minister confirm that all parties in the Executive agree on the  principle of PFI? I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comments on concerns about staff.  Will he assure the Assembly that those staff who have not yet transferred to  the Civil Service will be treated fairly and equitably, and that any of those  who transfer to the private sector will have their terms and conditions protected? Will he further assure the  Assembly that the private contractors who provide services on behalf of  Departments, such as security and reception, will be made fully aware of their  statutory obligations under section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I doubt whether any parties in the Executive agree to the principle of PFI. All  the parties in the Executive were prepared  to consider, on a case-by-case basis, whether that form of procurement  made sense in the circumstances. A range of procurement methods were  considered, and it was clear from studies that were carried out that PFI was  the best method for the project. I will not commit any political party to  having bought into PFI, but my party has concerns about it. I told the Executive  that I would not be found among the cheerleaders for PFI, but, if it makes  sense for a particular project, I am happy to recommend it, and it makes sense  for Workplace 2010.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We have a clear responsibility to our staff. I am glad that  there has been such a large uptake in staff wishing to transfer to the Civil  Service. In fact, I wonder why such an  option was not available in the past so that those people could have an  extended career path. There is no compulsory transfer to the private sector,  but if anyone chooses to transfer to the  private sector, their conditions will  fall under The Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment)  Regulations 2006.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McHugh</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s  statement, which allows Members an opportunity to raise issues relating to  Workplace 2010. On the equitability of job dispersal or decentralisation not  only to rural areas, but west of the Bann, the Minister mentioned that Omagh  did well in comparison to other towns. However, in my experience, Enniskillen  seems to have lost many jobs to Omagh, and that is the wrong direction, as far  those in Enniskillen are concerned.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Did the Minister take into account any criteria when considering the equitability of jobs dispersal? An  attempt was made to relocate public-sector jobs in the pensions branch to Fermanagh, but Civil Service officials  admitted that they did not have enough staff at grade 3 to even consider  bidding for such dispersal of jobs. Does that leave rural areas, such as  Fermanagh, unable to bid for such dispersal of jobs?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  The answer to that depends on the size of the office in question. Obviously,  there would be no point in placing a large  office &mdash; holding hundreds, if not  thousands, of people &mdash; in an area that is incapable of providing that  number of employees. I noted the eyes that were piercing into the Member&rsquo;s back  when he expressed his unhappiness about Omagh taking jobs away from  Enniskillen. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That is part of the  difficulty in focusing on individual areas in Northern Ireland; all those issues  come into play. Even if the Executive had  the wisdom of Solomon &mdash; and I suspect that they do not &mdash; it would be  very difficult to find a policy that would keep everyone happy, and through  which jobs would go to every area in Northern Ireland. The Executive  just cannot do that. The policy has to be open, fair and must be one that  people &mdash; considering the overall picture &mdash; can support. Members must bear in  mind that the rate of unemployment in Northern Ireland is 3&middot;4%, which is  the lowest ever. There are still jobs available, so there is an issue around  the number of people who will be available for jobs.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In an earlier debate, I  mentioned that there are consid&shy;erable advantages, other than  employment, in stopping people coming into Belfast from outlying areas. One such  advantage is reducing congestion. The Executive will consider their policy over  the coming weeks and months, and I hope that Members, when determining how good  that policy is, will not just think about their home towns, but the whole of Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  The Minister has outlined some implications for the capital budget if the  project is delayed: what are the implications for the resources budget and for  the conditions that civil servants have to work in?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  As I indicated, we are treading water, and that puts the matter at the highest  level of importance. Although &pound;70 million each year is being spent on the  present estate, millions of pounds worth of  work should be done annually to improve and upgrade the estate. If we  are not going to follow the Workplace 2010 route, using a PFI initiative, we  are going to have to invest more in the  general repair and maintenance of the buildings.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">One factor that has not  been touched on is the overall reform of the Civil Service. If our  reform project is to deliver the efficiencies that we want it to, we must be able to move the Civil Service to office  conditions that will enable staff to  work more effectively and efficiently. There will be a considerable loss  in that respect.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Some time ago, I asked my Department about the resource implications of a project delay. Over the  period of the comprehensive spending review, there will probably be tens  of millions of pounds in additional costs to the resource budget. Therefore,  there are resource and capital implications.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Irwin</strong>: I  add my thanks to the Minister for his statement.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the past five years,  what was the shortfall between what  should have been spent on Civil Service buildings and what was actually  spent?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>: Over the past five years the shortfall has been about &pound;20  million.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement, which was timely and appropriate. There  has been much concern expressed to me and many others in the Chamber, and  further afield, about the sale of land here &mdash;  particularly parkland and perhaps even this Building. Will the Minister assure Members and their constituents  that land, which many people feel was bequeathed to the people of the Province,  will not be sold? Will the Minister also confirm what buildings, if any, will  be sold, or be considered for sale, in the Stormont estate?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I thought at first that the Member was going  to test my Ulster Scots, but he let  me down. In the context of the debate, I assume that his use of the word  &ldquo;here&rdquo; refers to the Stormont estate and not to Northern Ireland. I assure the  Member that Parliament Buildings is not  included in any planned schemes that will become the subjects of PFI. We  are talking about buildings such as Castle Buildings, Craigantlet House &mdash; where  I am currently based &mdash; and Dundonald House, and there will be clear criteria  laid down in the contract to ensure that neither McDonald&rsquo;s nor Burger King opens up in place of those buildings.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  Why not?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>: I am sorry to disappoint the Member for East   Antrim. The Stormont estate is magnificent, and no one in the  Executive will put their hand to its destruction:  no one has any notion of including Parliament Buildings in such a  contract.</p>

	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Libraries Bill: Extension of Committee Stage</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure (Mr McElduff)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That, in accordance with Standing Order 31(4), the period  referred to in Standing Order 31(2) be extended to 25 February 2008, in  relation to the Committee Stage of the Libraries Bill (NIA Bill 5/07).</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. The Libraries Bill passed its Second Stage on 19 June  2007, and it was referred to the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure  on the same day. The Bill is an important piece of legislation, which seeks to  create a new library authority to replace the functions of five education and library board areas, in respect of libraries. The  Committee is anxious to ensure that  it carries out its responsibilities and conducts a rigorous scrutiny of  the legislation, and towards that end, the Committee agreed that it needed to  call a range of witnesses. It is, therefore, important that the Committee has sufficient  time to consider that forthcoming evidence.  That will ensure that the Assembly receives a well-balanced, informed  report from the Committee.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee is seeking  an extension to 25 February 2008  with a view to getting the Committee Stage of this important piece of legislation absolutely right.  However, we will endeavour to complete the Committee Stage as soon as  possible &mdash; hopefully short of 25 February. I ask Members for their support.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That, in accordance with Standing Order 31(4), the period  referred to in Standing Order 31(2) be extended to 25 February 2008, in  relation to the Committee Stage of the Libraries Bill (NIA Bill 5/07).</p>

	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That, as set out in section 2(4) of the Financial Assistance  for Political Parties Act (Northern Ireland) 2000, this Assembly approves the  revised scheme (NIA 26/07-08) laid before the Assembly on 20 September 2007,  for payments to political parties for the purpose of assisting Members of the  Northern Ireland Assembly who are connected with such parties to perform their  Assembly duties.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I move the motion on behalf of the Assembly Commission.  Members will be aware that the Financial Assistance for Political Parties Act (Northern Ireland)  2000 provides for payment to political parties for the purpose of assisting  Members to perform their duties. It does not provide payments to individual  Members. In tabling the motion, it is  proposed that a revised scheme will be put in place to provide  additional financial assistance to political parties to help offset the costs  incurred solely in running their Whips&rsquo; offices.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to bear in mind that the funding will be  ring-fenced and will only be made available for costs incurred in support of  the administration of Whips&rsquo; offices. Independent audited verification will be sought from each party in respect of any  expenditure incurred under the proposed scheme.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">1.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members will be aware that Whips act as their parties&rsquo;  business managers. They help to determine the business to be conducted by the  Assembly, and they keep Members informed of forthcoming Assembly business.  Whips provide advice and guidance to Members on procedural matters and liaise with  Whips of other parties to ensure that all Members perform their duties in a  co-ordinated and organised manner. They also act as facilitators for Members by  liaising with the Speaker and the Assembly staff on Members&rsquo; accommodation  requirements, IT services, and other matters.  All that work allows Members of the Assembly to concentrate on the  effective performance of their Assembly duties.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is with that in mind that the Commission has produced  this scheme, with all-party support.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><em>Question put and agreed to.</em></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><em>Resolved:</em></p>

The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes to  propose and 10 minutes to wind up. All other  speakers will have five minutes. Two amendments have been received and  published on the Marshalled List. The proposer of each amendment will have 10  minutes to propose and five minutes to wind up.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That this Assembly calls upon the Minister of  Education to intervene immediately in the classroom assistants&rsquo; dispute, in recognition  of the vital role of classroom assistants, and to prevent disruption to  children&rsquo;s education.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Recently, the Assembly discussed the matter of classroom  assistants and called on the Minister to intervene directly to resolve a very  serious situation. I am disappointed that the Minister is not here to talk  about the issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">At the time, the Minister said she did not have a problem  and that she thought that she had already complied with &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I will give way, but &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  It is just a point of information.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I will give way, although the Member will get her chance to speak, if it is a  point of information.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  I thank the Member for that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister is on her way down. The debate was not due to  start for another 10 minutes.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I appreciate that information, and that is fair enough.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that when I get to the summation she will be able to  understand what I am going to say.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Will you make a very clear ruling that  the House determines its business? It is not set by some timetable that is out  of our control, and Members should be in their places when debates start.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: The timings are just indicative.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>: Given that the clock has now started again, and the Minister  has arrived, I will try again.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly discussed the matter of classroom assistants  not so long ago, and Members urged the Minister to get involved directly. In  response to that motion, tabled by Mr Dominic Bradley, the Minister said that  she did not think that she had to do any more than had been done already. The  Minister felt that she had brought in an equitable solution. At that time she  clearly did not think there was a problem.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Now the Assembly is faced with a botched negotiation, a  strike, and entrenched positions that will be extremely difficult to resolve.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When her colleague the Minister of Agriculture and Rural  Development was faced with the foot-and-mouth disease crisis she moved with  considerable alacrity, consulted widely with all of the stakeholders, and was  commended by the Executive for the speed at which she dealt with the situation.  I wonder if the Minister of Education will respond in a similar manner to the  grave situation that we now face, or will she continue to focus her attention  elsewhere? Will she stop considering ideological hobby horses and start dealing  with matters in hand? When will the Minister realise that photo opportunities  are all well and good, but that there are some tough issues to be dealt with?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The previous debate on this subject was extremely useful,  and I do not intend to go over the core issues that were raised. However, I  bring to the attention of the House some  important matters of detail that explain the problems we face. It is  important that the Minister gets involved, because the matter is serious and is  escalating out of control. Now is the time to intervene decisively, to show  leadership and to take control. The Minister must tell us exactly how she will  resolve the situation &mdash; a final offer has been made and rejected, a ballot has  been taken, and people are now on strike.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Classroom assistants feel that they are being asked to take  a pay cut, and they cannot understand why. Members agree that they do a good  job. However, classroom assistants feel that they are the scapegoats for  failures elsewhere. While I deal with the situation of misunderstandings, will  the Minister clarify exactly how many  classroom assistants will need pay protection to avoid a reduction in  pay? There appears to be a misunderstanding whether that is an issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister&rsquo;s  Department presented the Committee for Education with a briefing note.  It used the words:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Not all posts were expected to increase in grade as a  result of evaluation.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">and,</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The results of the classroom assistants&rsquo; evaluation  also show that many are in fact already correctly graded.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, the briefing note says that:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;It is therefore a considerable cause for concern that  non union members are being denied the arrears due to them.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That may all be true. However, it does not suggest that  they will have to take a pay cut. That seems to be the crux of the issue. Some  people are being asked to take a pay cut, but everyone else says that they do  rather well.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have heard it said on several occasions &mdash; usually by  people on &pound;60,000 a year &mdash; that there are probably too many classroom assistants and that they are probably  overpaid. Does the Minister think that classroom assistants are overpaid? Could  she clarify that point?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I acknowledge that, for some time, the Minister&rsquo;s  Department has been working hard on those issues. However, does the Minister  know how hard and for how long? Does she know, for example, that, in November  2005, the South Eastern Education and Library Board reported to the Department  that it would have a deficit of &pound;600,000 after repaying &pound;3&middot;5 million to the  Department for a previous problem? However, six weeks later, the board said  that it was sorry and that it had made a mistake: the calculation was &pound;2  million out because it had forgotten to include the thirteenth lunar month for  the pay for classroom assistants, and it had forgotten to include in the budget  that there might be a job evaluation and pay review. Suddenly there was a big  problem.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are other issues. Is the Minister aware of KPMG&rsquo;s  final report, which shows that the number of special educational needs (SEN)  applications had doubled from one year to the next? The report comes up with  cryptic words and suggests that we should:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Focus medical input  on relevant issues&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">What does that mean? It means that we want fewer SENs.  There should be fewer statements, not because they are not needed, but because  we cannot afford them. Furthermore, the report refers to &ldquo;adult/general  assistants&rdquo;, rather than specialist assistants. </p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, classroom  assistants must be down&shy;graded. We should:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Revisit and implement recommendations of Internal  Audit report on Classroom Assistants (June 2004)</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented" style="margin-left:34.45pt;text-indent:-18.0pt;">Some management responses require challenge.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">In other words, go back and think again. Finally:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Revise policy decisions</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented" style="margin-left:32.2pt;text-indent:-18.0pt;">Employment of over-qualified classroom  assistants</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented" style="margin-left:32.2pt;text-indent:-18.0pt;">Non-legislative employment of nursery  classroom assistants.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Taken in the round, it means that while trying to  carry out a fair and equitable job evaluation, a decision was also taken to  reduce the number of classroom assistants and the amount of pay that they  receive.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Is the Minister aware that the Department, when it was  doing those things, was acting in opposition to the strategic direction of the  rest of the United Kingdom?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">&lsquo;Raising standards and tackling workload: a national  agreement&rsquo; was a unique agreement between Govern&shy;ment, unions and teachers,  which attempted to tackle stress levels and  overwork in schools. Key to that strategy was increasing the number of  classroom assistants and improving the training they received. Therefore at a  time when the Department of Education was seeking to reduce numbers in Northern Ireland,  other areas were increasing them. Given that this situation has come to a head,  I am interested in what the Minister of Education has to say about that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Other Members will speak of pay cuts, NVQ level 3 and other  matters that have been raised. I do not know what is to blame for this situation,  but I know the effect &mdash; morale has plummeted. Good, decent people are leaving  the jobs they love.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, we now  have a situation in which children who  were getting one-to-one care are now being bussed to other schools. The  result is that children with behavioural problems are being grouped together  with children with autism. That is not efficient, effective or humane, because  the first group know exactly which buttons to press to annoy the children with  autism. That is not the right way forward.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Classroom assistants  need this dispute to be resolved. The debate has gone on for far too  long, and everyone now wants to know what is going to be done to resolve the  situation. The time for prevarication, dithering and concentrating on issues such as Irish-medium education is over.  These issues are more pressing. Mr Speaker, I ask the Minister to put forward  some way to resolve the situation or schools will close.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Thank you, Mr McCrea; I was not expecting the promotion to Speaker  so soon. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Purvis</strong>: I  beg to move amendment No 1: Leave out all after &ldquo;Education&rdquo; and insert</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;to implement the  recommendations put forward by the trade unions in the dispute over classroom  assistants&rsquo; pay evaluation, and to liaise with the Minister of Finance and  Personnel to ensure that funds are made available in order to resolve the  situation and avert strike action.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have listened  carefully to Basil McCrea&rsquo;s comments. Some time ago, the Assembly debated  the issue of classroom assistants. I have tabled the amendment in order to ask Members whether they care about  children, their education and who looks after them. Do Members care if  the people who look after their children are skilled and educated to the  required level? Do they feel it safe to allow their children to be left in such  care? Members must consider those questions whenever classroom assistants are  discussed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members will talk about  pay evaluation, special-needs allowances, the need to have  qualifications to NVQ level 3, the hourly pay divisor, 32&middot;5-hour week, and pay  protection. However, that does not take away from the fact that this debate is  about children, some of whom are the most vulnerable in society.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is easy to talk about money and pay; it is easy to get bogged down in discussing how much more per  hour a person earns and how we protect the 32&middot;5-hour week.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">1.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, children are at the heart of the debate,  especially the most vulnerable children, such as those from disadvantaged  backgrounds, those suffering from autistic spectrum disorder, those with  behavioural difficulties or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and those  who have been traumatised by domestic violence or psychological abuse. Children  can be affected by a wide range of issues, such as poverty, the environment and  poor housing. Classroom assistants tend to work in schools in disadvantaged  areas and with the most vulnerable children.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I would like to ask the Minister a direct question. I do  not support the second amendment, because the Minister has met the trade  unions, management side and the boards. The issues of special needs, NVQ level  3, the hourly pay divisor and pay protection have all been discussed at those  meetings. They are continually being discussed. I asked the Minister the other  day how the dispute could be resolved. She replied that all she could tell me  was that negotiations were ongoing.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I can tell the Minister that negotiations are not ongoing.  Representatives of the management side have met trade unions in the last few  months and they have not negotiated; they set down the final offer that was  discussed in the last debate, and they have not moved one millimetre, never  mind one inch, on the issue. No negotiation is taking place.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The simple reason for that is that there is no money. The  Minister should stand up and say that there is no money. It is great to see the  co-operation of the Executive and the collective decision-making when it comes  to money. However, Members are on their own when it comes to asking for new  money. The sides split; nobody walks across the Floor when it comes to new  money. The co-operation will probably end today because of this issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members must stand up and be counted. Do we care about the  children and the people who look after them? When the parent of a child with  special needs goes to work, he or she leaves with the knowledge that the child  is being looked after to the best standard available because of the classroom  assistant&rsquo;s skills. How can a parent leave with confidence, unless he or she  knows that the child will be well looked after?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If assistants are expected to take a cut in pay or if they  do not have to be qualified to NVQ level 3, will the parent have the confidence  to leave his or her child in the classroom?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  I am worried about the line that the Member is taking. The implication is that  classroom assistants &mdash; who do a superb job &mdash; will do that job only if they are  given the right amount of money, and, if not given that money, will do a second-class  job.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I would like the Member to clarify that, regardless of this  pay dispute, classroom assistants do not have to be bribed to give the care and  attention that they give to youngsters. They give it very well.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Purvis</strong>:  The Member is absolutely right. I apologise if I gave the impression that  classroom assistants will not do their jobs properly if they are not given the  level of pay that they want. As I said, this dispute is also about skills and  qualifications and the special-needs allowance. It is about people who can care  for children to a certain standard. We have that standard, and classroom  assistants do a tremendous job, which is why the Assembly and the Minister must  take the issue so seriously. We will see  standards sliding if the requirement that assistants have an NVQ level 3  is not retained.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The issue boils down to how women and how disadvantaged and  vulnerable children are valued and respected in this society. It is time that  Members stood up &mdash; rather than hide behind their party policy or the  co-operativeness of the Executive &mdash; and told the Executive to put their money  where their collective mouth is. Do they support those people or not?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Donaldson</strong>:  I beg to move amendment No 2: Leave out all after the second &ldquo;assistants&rdquo; and  insert</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;,by convening an urgent  meeting of the Department, employers and Trade Union side in the dispute, with  an agreed agenda to include (a) retention of the Special Needs Allowance; (b)  retention of the 32.5 hourly pay divisor; (c) NVQ III and the job evaluation exercise;  and (d) adequate pay protection arrangements, in order to prevent disruption to  children&rsquo;s education.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I declare an interest as a governor of Parkview Special   School in Lisburn. I echo  the comments of the Member for East Belfast Ms Purvis in respect of the  excellent work carried out by classroom assistants &mdash; particularly in special  schools. Ms Purvis mentioned children on  the autistic spectrum. I have had the privilege of witnessing at first hand &mdash; in Parkview  Special School  in Lisburn; in Beechlawn  Special School  in Hillsborough; and in Brookfield   Special School  in Moira &mdash; the excellent work that is done by classroom assistants in special  education. There is no doubt in my mind that they are essential and that they  provide an excellent support service to  teaching staff in those special schools.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Owing to the Government&rsquo;s policy of integrating children  with special needs into mainstream education &mdash;  through the Special Educational Needs and Disability (Northern Ireland) Order 2005 &mdash; there are now  many classroom assistants working in mainstream schools across Northern Ireland.  They provide support to those pupils with special needs who have, and are  being, integrated into those schools, and  they do very important work.  Classroom assistants also work in the pre-school, nursery and the  early-years sectors in Northern    Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">No Member would dissent from the view that we have the  highest regard for classroom assistants. That was also indicated by the Member  for Lagan Valley Basil McCrea when he proposed the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There needs to be a  resolution to the dispute. Urgency is required because, on Wednesday 26  September 2007, if there is no progress in the discussions, there is the  prospect of industrial action, which will result in classroom assistants  withdrawing their services for the day. For the special schools, that probably  means having to close for the day because  they cannot manage without the  support provided by the classroom assistants. I have already had &mdash; as, I am sure, have other Members &mdash; calls  from worried parents who are concerned about what they will do if those schools  have to close.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Some parents are in a situation where both of them work,  and they depend on their children going to school to be able to get their  domestic affairs in order. They are also concerned about what will happen if  industrial action intensifies. There is the possibility of a three-day closure,  then progressively increasing the number of days on which schools are closed. I  believe that all Members take the view that it is in everyone&rsquo;s best interest &mdash;  particularly the children and their parents &mdash; if industrial action can be  avoided.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I, in common with many Members, have received  correspondence from classroom assistants outlining their case.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will quote from two such letters. The first is from Mrs Heather McCann, who lives in my own  constituency. Heather is one of 16 classroom assistants in Beechlawn Special School  in Hillsborough. She wrote:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Education Board  feel that we should be brought into line with clerical staff i.e. a 36 hour  week and the same pay scales, but we are classroom based, not office based. We  work hand in hand with the teachers &mdash; for and on behalf of the children. The  Education Board seem to feel this role has very little value at all. Their  proposals have made us feel demoralised, devalued and degraded.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I met Heather and some of her colleagues from Beechlawn Special School.  The classroom assistants feel strongly about the manner in which they are being  dealt. They feel particularly strongly about the hourly divisor that will be  used to calculate their pay. Although they do not claim to be teaching staff,  they work similar hours to teachers and are classroom-based. They consider that  the 32-hour divisor that was used hitherto ought to be retained for the calculation  of their pay. Some will lose out financially if the Depart&shy;ment and the boards  proceed with current proposals.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I feel strongly that that would be unfair, particularly for  those classroom assistants who have been in their jobs for many years and who  are being told that their existing contracts will be linked to the children  that they support. Therefore, if a classroom assistant supports a child who is  reaching their final years of education, the assistant&rsquo;s contract may have only  one or two years to go before they have to begin again. I understand why they  would feel aggrieved about that.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way. Does the Member accept that, given that  classroom assistants&rsquo; hours are linked to those of children, it is impossible  for an assistant to work a full week? Classroom assistants can work only 32&middot;5  hours a week. Therefore, it is unfair to equate them with clerical staff, who  may continue working after school hours. Working longer hours would mean that  they would be penalised. If classroom assistants cannot work a full week, how  can they acquire a full pension entitlement?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Donaldson</strong>:  I thank my hon Friend for his intervention. He is absolutely right. The  unfairness of what is proposed for classroom assistants is at the heart of the  dispute. I understand why classroom assistants feel so strongly and why they  are prepared to take industrial action.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will quote from a letter that Mrs Lorraine Kelly wrote.  She is a classroom assistant in the Minister&rsquo;s constituency, and she works in  St Colmcille&rsquo;s High School in Crossgar. She wrote:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;I do what I consider  to be very important and rewarding work as a classroom assistant, helping  children with physical or learning difficulties to access the school  curriculum, but my sense of self-worth has  been eroded by a long-standing failure of government (from 1995) to  settle a pay dispute and award a fair wage to myself and my colleagues.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">She has a valid point.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That brings me to ask what the Assembly can do to assist in the resolution of the dispute. I share  the concerns raised by Mr McCrea, a Member for Lagan Valley.  With the greatest respect, I say to the Minister that the Department is not giving this issue the priority  attention that it deserves. When the  Minister spoke in the previous Assembly  debate on the matter, she said &ldquo;This matter is urgent&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Official Report, Vol 22, No 13, p559, col  1]</span>.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">However, we are no further on. One has no sense  that the Department is trying urgently to resolve the matter. Echoing Mr  McCrea&rsquo;s words, I am saying to the Minister that I want to hear more about the  Department&rsquo;s prioritising this sort of issue and spending less time on smaller  issues such as Irish-medium education. In the overall scheme of things,  Irish-medium education affects a small number of pupils, whereas this affects  large numbers of pupils and staff. Therefore, it deserves greater priority than  the Minister gives it. I hope that she will assure us that, when she says that  a matter is urgent, she will act with the urgency that it deserves.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">1.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I commend to the House the amendment that my hon Friend Miss McIlveen and I tabled. I cannot  support the amendment that the Member for East Belfast Ms Purvis tabled,  because it is not for the Assembly to determine the outcome of the classroom  assistants&rsquo; dispute. It is a matter for the employer, the classroom assistants,  the trade unions and the Department of Education to resolve.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The DUP amendment urges  those involved to resolve the dispute immediately, in terms that are  beneficial to classroom assistants, and to address adequately the agenda items,  as listed in our amendment, that should be  at the heart of any meeting. Our amendment outlines the appropriate role  for the Assembly to take. I urge the Department to sort out the matter, avert  strike action and give the classroom assistants a decent and fair deal.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Butler</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Ar dt&uacute;s, ba mhaith liom a r&aacute; go  bhfuil Sinn F&eacute;in ag tabhairt taca&iacute;ochta do na c&uacute;nt&oacute;ir&iacute; ranga ina bhfeachtas ar  son p&aacute;ighe agus coinn&iacute;ollacha le roinnt blianta anuas. Over many years, Sinn  F&eacute;in has given full backing to classroom assistants in their campaign for  better pay and conditions. Sinn F&eacute;in MLAs and councillors  have stood on picket lines alongside class&shy;room assistants. Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s  elected representatives have publicly  raised the issue and backed classroom assistants. Others in the Chamber,  including some from the parties that tabled the motion and amendments, have not been as proactive as they would have us  believe.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Since the debate on the classroom assistants&rsquo; dispute in June, much criticism has been levelled at the  Minister of Education, Caitr&iacute;ona Ruane. What have those who tabled the  motion and the amendments, and who lined up in June to criticise Caitr&iacute;ona  Ruane, done in the intervening period to achieve a resolution, except to bring  the matter to the Assembly at the eleventh hour?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There has been an ongoing campaign against the Minister of  Education &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Butler</strong>:  No.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The classroom assistants&rsquo; dispute is the latest in a host  of issues in that campaign.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in fully  recognises the pivotal role that class&shy;room assistants play in the  education system. They deserve, and should be entitled to, pay and work  conditions that reflect their important role in education. Many industrial  disputes are settled in a matter of months, so it is unfortunate that the  dispute in question has continued for 11 years. It is legitimate to ask why it  has taken 11 years for the dispute to reach the point at which industrial  action will be taken on Wednesday. I hope that we can avert the imminent  industrial action at this late hour.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in supports the motion, which calls on the Minister to intervene in the dispute. However, we  cannot support the proposed amendments. They would place restrictions on  all sides involved. They would also put the  Minister in a difficult position should she intervene, since she would  have to get agreement from all sides. All parties that are involved in the  dispute must get around the table to try to reach agreement, and the amend&shy;ments, if accepted, would not assist that  outcome.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The dispute has been going on for far too long. The  employers, the education and library boards and the unions that represent the  classroom assistants must redouble their efforts to bring the dispute to an  end. Classroom assistants have been left behind by a job-evaluation exercise  that dates from 1995. That exercise has been completed for other sections of  the education and library boards&rsquo; workforce but has left classroom assistants  in an unfortunate situation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Despite having  protested and gone on strike, class&shy;room  assistants are still involved in a protracted industrial dispute over  their pay and conditions. Tuigeann Sinn F&eacute;in r&oacute;l l&aacute;rnach t&aacute;bhachtach c&uacute;nt&oacute;ir&iacute;  ranga, agus ba ch&oacute;ir cothrom na F&eacute;inne a thabhairt d&oacute;ibh.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly must acknowledge that, as another Member said,  99% of classroom assistants are female. Those women are reluctant to go down  the road of strike action: it does not come easily to them, given that they  work with children, many of whom have special needs. The Assembly must also  acknowledge the help and support that classroom assistants have provided to  children with special needs and learning difficulties. The classroom  assistant&rsquo;s role is often to help children who would otherwise fall behind the  rest of the class.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Caitr&iacute;ona Ruane has met all the parties involved in negotiations and has made resources available to  resolve the dispute. Unfortunately, her efforts have not been able to  end it, and industrial action is due to take place on 26 September. The  priority is to resolve the dispute.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>: In today&rsquo;s politically correct society, equality plays a major part in any employment  scenario. Therefore, it is disturbing when a group of people in  education, who play a major part in children&rsquo;s school days, have largely been  ignored and undervalued for the past 12 years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Next to the home, parents expect schools to be places of  contentment and learning for their children and grandchildren. Five days a  week, parents entrust their children to the safe haven of school, where they  will learn and play their way through a curriculum that expands year after year and demands more and more from teachers and  classroom assistants. Yet, classroom assistants must fight to get what is  rightfully theirs.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is unbelievable and disgraceful that classroom  assistants must fight to have 12 years of wrongful grading corrected and face the prospect that their hourly rate  will also be devalued. The outlook is even bleaker for those who work with  children who have statements of special educational need: they stand to lose  their special-needs allowance. Why should that happen when the payment will  remain untouched for teachers in Northern Ireland and classroom assistants in the  UK?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That is only one of the many symptoms of the vile disease  of cuts in the education system. However, who decided that the lower-paid  worker should suffer? My colleague, Dominic Bradley, and I met classroom  assistants and their representatives. Their frustration was palpable. Indeed,  there was anger, because some of their colleagues have died &mdash; one in May 2007,  for example &mdash; without having received what was due to them. There is much bad  feeling about that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, the dedication of the workers continues. They have  tried desperately to resolve the situation and have not once allowed it to  interfere in the education of Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s children. All they have received  in return for their loyalty and dedication are additional problems to overcome,  such as their payment divisor being amended in order that the education and  library boards could save money. In this day and age, how could an employer  allocate set working hours, yet use a  divisor of 3&middot;5 hours when working out salary increases just to ease the  burden on their budget? It is criminal and disgraceful, and a private  organisation would have been in court quicker  than one could say &ldquo;compensation&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  Does the hon Member agree that classroom assistants are more than just that?  Under child protection law, they are also the eyes and ears of those in more senior positions in the school; for  example, when people are patrolling around a school in order to prey on  young children &mdash; totally unacceptable behaviour that should result in such  people being put behind bars immediately.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>: I thank the Member for his inter&shy;vention. I certainly agree  with him. Put all of that &mdash; and the  wrangling over the NVQ level 3, which, despite being essential for employment as a classroom assistant, will go  unrecognised &mdash; into a large melting pot, and the result is 7,000 classroom  assistants who are sick, sore and tired of  being booted between the five education and library boards and the  Department. They are sick of being given excuse after excuse. The result is  that 93% have had enough and have spoken by ballot.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Apart from the workers, the other losers are the children  who depend daily on the extra help that is given so carefully by classroom  assistants.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, I can see no reason why every Assembly Member  should not &mdash; or could not &mdash; make an effort to resolve that scandalous  situation. We face a real threat of strike action, which we have been informed  about this week. Therefore, I urge the Minister of Education &mdash; as I did on 19  June 2007 &mdash; to do all in her power to help resolve this matter, rather than  delaying the game any further. Otherwise, the ball will be lifted and the  players will leave the pitch.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Spending &pound;30 million was never going to make the problem go away. What is different now? I am  interested to know whether the Minister saw the press coverage at the  weekend of how her colleagues, at last &mdash; at least those in Derry  &mdash; are supporting the classroom assistants: or was that just a case of jumping  on the bandwagon to grab a headline?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley:</strong>: I  apologise for taking up my colleague&rsquo;s time.  I recall a morning, outside St Mark&rsquo;s High School in Warrenpoint, when  the Minister &mdash; then an ordinary Assembly Member &mdash; stood with protesting  classroom assistants and offered them 100% support. I am concerned that that  support has now been retracted, and I ask the Minister whether those classroom  assistants are entitled to equality in the workplace.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind the House that when Members  give way, they are entitled to an extra minute.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  As I said, I asked the Minister, on 19 June 2007, to do something about the  classroom assistants&rsquo; situation. I felt passionately about the issue then, as I  continue to do. I remind the Minister that she has children who attend school  and, therefore, will recognise the worth of  classroom assistants. We all know their worth. End the current situation  in which those classroom assistants find themselves, and end it now.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: It  is unfortunate that, yet again, we are debating the same issue that was debated  &mdash; and on which a motion was passed &mdash; on 19 June 2007. Given the threat of industrial  action, and the potentially devastating  effect of that on the education of our children, it is entirely  appropriate that we revisit the matter. I hope that the Minister gets the  message this time.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party is sympathetic to the unions in as far as the current problem represents the last  outstanding dispute. Nevertheless, we cannot simply agree to the unions&rsquo;  recommendations without taking into account the financial reality faced by the  Department and the education and library boards. The amendment tabled by Dawn  Purvis takes no account of financial reality; it merely asks the Minister of  Finance and Personnel to bankroll the settlement of an industrial dispute. That  is ridiculous.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is a significant gap between the funds that are  available and the funds that are required to meet the trade unions&rsquo; recommendations. If that gap were bridged, money  would have to be taken from elsewhere in the education budget.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I point out the cost of segregation, as highlighted by  Deloitte, and its effect on the education budget in particular. If we did not  have so much duplication of expenditure in Northern Ireland, there would be  more money available to do the work that really matters. My colleagues and I  have received significant levels of correspondence from classroom assistants,  as has, I am sure, every Member. I can tell Ms Purvis that the correspondence  was not solely from females. I detected a hint of sexism in Ms Purvis&rsquo;s  approach to the issue. It is not a gender issue.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Purvis</strong>: I  call Members&rsquo; attention to my contribution to the debate on 19 June 2007. I  said quite clearly during that debate that the majority of classroom assistants  were women. I apologise if I gave the impression that I was talking only about  women. However, the majority of classroom assistants are women and, therefore,  the majority of classroom assistants affected by that decision are women.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>:  Fair enough. I thank the Member for clarifying that point. However, I know how  her remarks sounded. The issue of classroom assistants&rsquo; remuneration is  extremely complex. Like so many issues, it can only be resolved through  dialogue. Complications include the details of re-evaluation; the requirement  of the boards, which are currently underfunded, to provide the money; and the  need to channel appropriate money to the boards.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is no easy solution and there is no point in  pretending otherwise. The implication of Ms Purvis&rsquo;s amendment is that the wage  increase should be paid. Last week in the Chamber I said that parents, teaching  professionals and everyone else with a stake in education are becoming  increasingly concerned by the Minister&rsquo;s lack of action in a range of areas.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is my view that urgent action by the Minister &mdash; starting  a dialogue with the unions, at least &mdash; could still help to avert strike action.  We must not restrict the Minister&rsquo;s actions unnecessarily. That said, it is  really hard not to sympathise with the unions&rsquo; views, particularly as regards  the special-needs allowance, the requirement for NVQ level 3 &mdash; now discarded by  the boards &mdash; and the 32&middot;5-hour/36-hour pay divisor.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">1.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, it is up to the Minister to judge how best to take  this matter forward, and it is up to Members to urge her and encourage her to  do so. I trust that she will move the process on as quickly as possible. The  Alliance Party intends to support the motion and amendment No 2.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  In June, the Assembly called on the Minister  of Education to take immediate action to settle the issue of job  evaluation for classroom assistants. It is  now September, and we face the prospect of industrial action in two  days&rsquo; time by one of the unions. I understand that it is only a matter of time  before other unions ballot their members on the issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has been charged to act and has failed to deliver  the goods. I am not surprised by that failure. It is just one in a string of  failures: there has been a failure to decide on the issue of academic  selection; a failure to provide a clear policy on the implementation of the  Bain Report; and a failure to account to the Assembly for her exorbitance in  her announcements on the opening of wasteful Irish-medium schools and on  unnecessary amalgamations. No doubt the longer she remains in her present post,  the longer the failures will continue to mount.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">She is the second Sinn F&eacute;in Education Minister to have  failed to deal with this pay dispute, which is now the longest-running pay  dispute ever in Northern    Ireland. I am beginning to wonder whether a  Sinn F&eacute;&iacute;n Education Minister will ever do anything constructive while holding  the ministerial portfolio. Do destructive habits die hard?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am not surprised that the situation has reached the point where classroom assistants have resolved to  strike. In fact, I applaud the classroom assistants for their patience. It has been a long 12 years. They play a  valued role in the education of our children but remain some of the  lowest-paid workers in the public sector. The facts and figures surrounding  this dispute have been detailed not only in  this debate, but in the debate in June. I do not intend to rehearse  them. Suffice it to say, we are no further forward now than we were back then.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is time that the Minister and the Department sat down  with the education boards and the unions, and they must not leave until this  matter is resolved. Amendment No 2 calls for an appropriate agenda for those  talks. It does not call for capitulation, but for discussion and negotiation.  If such discussions are to take place &mdash; and I sincerely hope that they will &mdash; I  will ask for all parties to approach the matter with mature, open minds to come  to an equitable settlement. Unfortunately,  I am unable to support amendment No 1, tabled  by the Member for East Belfast. That amendment  shifts the blame to the Minister of  Finance and Personnel. This matter  clearly falls within the remit of the Minister of Education and her  Department, and it is up to her and her Department to sort it out once and for  all.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">One union has voted for strike action, but let us not  permit the current situation to deteriorate any further. I echo Unison&rsquo;s call  for eleventh-hour talks to resolve the dispute. We must remember that it will  be the children who will suffer from the disruption of their education. Working parents will face additional  expense as a result of additional childminding costs, and all parents  will face upheaval as they may be forced to collect their children halfway  through a school day because of insufficient staffing. Even if this week&rsquo;s  strike action is not avoided, I call on the Minister and the Department not to  rest until a resolution is found &mdash; before further days are lost.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. I think that the Member  has let the cat out of the bag on the Department of Finance and Personnel issue. She said that discussions to  resolve this dispute should be supported by all parties, and I agree with her.  However, making cheap jibes at the Minister of Education does not show a desire  to encourage all parties to support those efforts. In my view, getting rid of  the 11-plus was good work carried out by a Sinn F&eacute;in Education Minister, as was  increasing the amount of money spent on special education. If this is about  collective decision-making and responsibility &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  No, I will not give way.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If the Member is serious about getting all-party support on  this matter, she should stay away from the cheap jibes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I support Basil McCrea&rsquo;s motion, which calls on the  Minister to intervene in the classroom assistants&rsquo; pay dispute. I fully accept  &mdash; as did Jeffrey Donaldson &mdash; that the matter is complex and that we all want to  see it resolved.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mary Bradley is right; this does not just have a negative  impact on us as Assembly Members or on communities in general. It has a  negative impact on our children and on the work that classroom assistants do  every day. They are not there just to assist. They are there to play a positive  role in the lives of the children they work with. In fairness, every Member who  has contributed to this debate has recognised the positive work that is done by  classroom assistants. There is no dispute about the contribution that they make  to our schools, especially in relation to children with special educational  needs &mdash; that has also been mentioned in the debate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Classroom assistants make up one of the most highly professional sectors of the educational  workforce, providing learning support to the most vulnerable people in  society. Several debates over the past few weeks in the Assembly have mentioned  young people with special needs and those who live in poverty. It is important to recognise that when we &mdash; or the  Executive, collectively &mdash; talk about the most vulnerable people in society. The Minister has a measure of  responsibility, but so does the Executive. If this is solely a matter of  funding &mdash; and I know that it is not &mdash; the Executive, through the Department of  Finance and Personnel, the Minister of Education and her Department, must sort  it out now.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is no doubt in the Chamber about the role of  classroom assistants. No one would challenge the value of their contribution.  This dispute has gone on for 10 or 11 years, and, in fairness to Mary Bradley,  I do not think that any of my colleagues in Derry  has taken cheap publicity shots on this. I have been on the picket line over the  years. If we are being honest, and saying that we all support the motion for  whatever reason, and want it resolved once and for all, we should not take  cheap shots. The Minister has children of her own, and in the previous debate  on 19 June committed herself to resolving the situation. I support her in her  efforts. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I support the DUP amendment. The Assembly discussed this not so long ago and  made a strong case for equality, fairness and justice for the 7,000 classroom  assistants in the workforce.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that Members are familiar with the film  &lsquo;Groundhog Day&rsquo;, in which Bill Murray&rsquo;s alarm clock wakes him every day at 6.00  am to the sound of Cher&rsquo;s singing, and his day repeats over and over again. We  have an equivalent in the Chamber and the Province: Caitr&iacute;ona Ruane is the  actress starring in &lsquo;Groundhog Day&rsquo;. She wakes up every day at 6.00 am, the  alarm goes off, Cher is singing, and the same thing happens for the classroom  assistants &mdash; nothing.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The classroom assistants have had the same problem for the  past 12 years. They have been waking up to the same thing over and over again.  The time has come for the Minister to accept her responsibility and decide that  it is time to move on.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In a rare feat for the Assembly some time back in June,  there was little disagreement about the fact that the situation is unfair.  However, there was a not-so-rare attempt by the Shinners to twist words to  protect their Minister and say that she is doing all she can. The fact of the  matter is &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  No, I will not. One might safely say that we are in a worse situation, as the  classroom assistants&rsquo; union have decided that they have no option but to  strike. That is not a decision that the members of the union have taken  lightly. Indeed, it is all that is left to them to do after 12 years of  patience, talking, and waiting for the Government, our Assembly and our  Minister to do something. They have no desire what&shy;soever to stand outside the  schools on Wednesday and watch the children whom they love and help walk past  them into the classrooms without them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; ">For the record, members  of my party and I have stood </span>on the picket line with the classroom  assistants. I did it in Portavogie and in Newtownards, and I am sure that <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt; ">other Members will say that they have done so  elsewhere.</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Classroom assistants do not wish to leave the teachers,  whose workload is incredibly high due to the amount of paperwork and red tape  that they must wade through in addition to teaching 30 children, without help.  For 12 years, classroom assistants have allowed their thoughts of the children  and their respect for their teacher colleagues to stop them taking the strike  action that has often been the port of call for so many other employment issues.  However, enough is enough: we can no longer blame the indifference of the  direct rule Minister. We must look closer to home to see why our classroom  assistants are left with nothing else to do other than wait for justice for  another 12 years. Such a wait cannot be expected.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I could mention in detail, as other Members have done, the  special-needs allowance, the change in the salaries for classroom assistants,  and that their pay is based on a 36-hour week despite the fact that most of  them work only 10 to 12 hours a week. Instead, I will put on record the  concerns of my constituents, who have repeatedly and forcefully reiterated the  need for classroom assistants in the schools in my constituency of Strangford.  Parents have acknowledged the vital role played by classroom assistants in the  education of their children. As other Members have said, children who are  young, were premature or have slight learning difficulties are still able to  excel and fulfil their potential given the opportunity offered by the support  and commitment from classroom assistants. Teachers have explained to me how  overwhelming their job is and that it would be impossible to meet the criteria  and allow each child to find his or her individual place in the classroom  without the aid of a classroom assistant. They would find it next to impossible  to do it all by themselves, and they rely on the presence of the assistant, not  only for learning resources but for help with behavioural issues.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It has been found that children are better behaved in  classrooms that have classroom assistants. They give the teachers eyes in the  back of their head to see what is going on in the classroom. I have also been  told of one school, where the cleaner can potentially earn more than the  classroom assistants. Where is the equality and fairness in that?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Classroom assistants have done their job faithfully year  after year, supporting the teacher, loving the children and pouring  immeasurable worth into their lives, and it galls them to consider strike  action. When 93% of classroom assistants voted for strike action, they did so  out of desperation. I ask the Minister to consider that and to do the right  thing: release the money and ensure that equality and fairness prevail,  beginning in our schools where the future of our children is at stake, and do  it now. Let us not see this matter before the House in another few months.  Members must demand a difference and teach the learning authority a lesson on  fairness, which it has consistently failed to heed for the past 12 years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As &lsquo;Groundhog Day&rsquo; finished on a happy note, I urge the  Minister to conclude this issue on a happy note for classroom assistants.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  As a governor of two primary schools in Newtownabbey,  I declare an interest in the matter. It is a hard act to follow our film  critic, Mr Shannon, but at least he did not burst into song as some of his  colleagues are apt to do. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span> Please no,  please no.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Along with other Members, I have a sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu as we  again debate the issue of classroom assistants. The long-running dispute is in  danger of finding a slot in &lsquo;Guinness World Records&rsquo; if it continues to bounce  along with no satisfactory outcome in sight.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">One of the major bones of contention is the requirement to  offer a level 3 NVQ when applying for the position of a classroom assistant.  That is a perfectly reasonable requirement as we seek to improve the  qualification levels of all of those working in schools and strive to increase  the standards of literacy and numeracy. However, the failure to recognise such  a vital qualification during the negotiations around the job evaluation is  puzzling to say the least and is clearly an unsustainable situation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In 2003, the Government produced a key document entitled  &lsquo;Raising Standards and Tackling Workload&rsquo;. While clearly differentiating  between the roles of teachers and assistants, it stated:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The remuneration of support staff, including high  level teaching assistants, will need to reflect their level of training, skills  and responsibilities&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Surely, that suggests that the boards should now  take into account the qualifications of classroom assistants, namely, the NVQs.  However, there appears to have been a last-minute &ldquo;moving of the waters&rdquo;, which  might allow some common sense to reign at last.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Does the Member welcome the fact that it appears that, as a consequence of  today&rsquo;s <span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; ">motion, which stands in the name of  the Ulster Unionist </span>Party, progress has &mdash; at long last &mdash; been made on  the dispute? Does he agree that such progress will be very welcome?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  I am glad that the Member has intervened, even if he has stolen my thunder. I  have in my hand a fax that suggests that there has been some movement between  the employers and the unions. I think that  a meeting took place between them on Friday afternoon, at which an offer  was proposed. That offer was to be made  known today. Whether that has happened, I cannot comment, but I hope  that the Minister will confirm that that is the situation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The union side has  apparently met the chief executives of the five boards, and, although  that is not the usual negotiating position, it at least represents forward  movement. Those emergency talks appear to have led to an offer&rsquo;s being made  this morning. Whether that offer is acceptable and meaningful, we wait for the  Minister to tell us. I hope that the offer will be meaningful. I hope that it  will protect the historical contractual rights and include a framework that  will enable the service to meet not only its current needs but its future  needs.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>: I am sorry; I am running out of time.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, the Department and the Minister must come clean.  The Minister must assure the House that they are not rigidly instructing the  employers to remain within some predetermined financial allocation, thereby  delaying any potential settlement.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Given that the Minister  has some difficulty in grasping the serious roadblock that such a stance  may be causing when the problem is expressed to her in plain English, I put it  to her in a language that she promotes ad nauseam? F&aacute;g an bealach. Minister.  Clear the way, and settle the issue now.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education (Ms Ruane)</strong>: Go raibh maith  agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I say immediately that I find myself very  much in sympathy with the motion. I regret that the dispute has continued for  so long, and I do not want to see any disruption caused to our children&rsquo;s  education. I recognise fully the vital role that classroom assistants perform,  and I take this opportunity to express my gratitude and appreciation to them  once again.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have visited many schools since my appointment and have  seen at first hand the commitment that so many dedicated individuals in our  education system show. Classroom assistants play an invaluable role. They are a  hugely positive force in the lives of the children whom they serve. They work with  some of our most-vulnerable young people, including those who have a range of  special needs. They provide much-needed general support in every primary 1  class, and in those primary 2 classes in areas where attainment is low and  social deprivation far too high.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>: I  will not, no.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For me, there is absolutely no doubt about the value <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt; ">of the role that classroom assistants play in the  education </span>of our children and young people. It was only right,  therefore, that a proper mechanism be put in place to ensure that the work that  classroom assistants carry out was evaluated fairly and consistently, and to  ensure that jobs of equal value received equal pay. That was the purpose of the  job evaluation scheme.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Nuair a phl&eacute;igh muid an t-&aacute;bhar seo an uair dheireanach ar  19 Meitheamh, ghlac m&eacute; leis go raibh an sc&eacute;al ag dul ar aghaidh ar feadh  r&oacute;-fhada agus gur g&aacute; &eacute; a r&eacute;iteach gan mhoill. Rinne m&eacute; amach labhairt leis na  boird agus leis na ceardchumainn faoin &aacute;bhar.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When we last debated the issue of classroom assistants, on  19 June 2007, I accepted that the dispute had gone on far too long. I undertook  to speak to the boards and the trade unions to urge them to reach a speedy  resolution to the dispute. After that debate, I met the boards on 21 June and  the unions on 29 June. I made it absolutely clear to both sides that, in the  interests of the classroom assistants and the children with whom they work,  they needed to redouble their efforts in order to reach a fair and equitable settlement.  I told them that that had to be done quickly, in order to enable the funding to  be released into people&rsquo;s pay packets as soon as possible. In the period since,  I have keep abreast of the situation, through briefings from my officials and  through a substantial volume of correspondence, some from classroom assistants  who are caught up in the dispute. Negotiations between the boards and the  unions continued, with numerous meetings being held between the management side  and union joint secretaries. Board chief executives and senior union officials  have met to discuss the issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">More recently, the boards have written to all classroom  assistants to explain the current position on the evaluation of their posts.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A LeasCheann Comhairle, during the debate on 19 June 2007,  both Members in whose name the motion stands  rose to speak. Hansard records that, with reference to the funding that  has been made available to the boards to resolve the dispute, Mr Basil McCrea  said:</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;I support the motion, because it is not for me to say what  is equitable and what is not.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Official Report, Vol 22,  No 13, p553, col 1]</span>.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Really, does anyone know what that means? I do not, and,  after listening to the Member today, I am fairly certain that he does not know  either. It seems to me that, on 19 June, the Member had no understanding of the  dispute and no idea how to resolve it. Judging from his contribution today, I  believe that he still has no idea.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the opportunity to shine a light on the dispute.  It is great to have the concerns of a group of working-class women debated in  the Assembly. One might think that they will have been greatly heartened to  witness Members almost trip over themselves to express their support and  solidarity for those poor women. They could be forgiven a little scepticism,  because, in June, those very same Members, with a few notable exceptions, did  the same, but when the press had packed up and gone home, those Members did  nothing.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have laid out for the Assembly what I have done. The  classroom assistants should know, however, if they do not know already, that,  with the exception of people such as Paul Butler of Sinn F&eacute;in, Dawn Purvis of  the PUP and one or two Members from the DUP and from the SDLP, not one of the  other Members who spoke so passionately today, or on 19 June, has approached me  on behalf of the classroom assistants. Not one. I have received scores of  letters and questions for written and oral answer on every other issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members have shown their prejudice against the Irish  language; I have heard the comments. Shame on you. Do you not understand that  classroom assistants work in all schools, including Irish-language schools?  What you need to do is to forget the prejudice against the Irish language, stop  all that nonsense and start dealing with equality. We have heard about equality  in this House. Sammy Wilson &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span> You  never miss an opportunity to show prejudice and bias against the Irish  language. Your concern about gender equality  is touching. Every time that I rise in the House, I am attacked, and  other women who are Members are treated very badly when they rise to speak.  Therefore, I hope that the classroom assistants understand how important gender  equality is to your party.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Sammy Wilson, the Chairperson of the Committee for Education, is present today. What has that  Committee actually done? How many times has it met with the classroom  assistants? It will meet with them soon, we are told. It is only three and a  half months since it saddled that particular high horse, so the Committee  should be given a bit of time. Sammy&rsquo;s concern for the working class is  touching. Sammy, if you really want to deal with working-class issues and  disadvantage, you need to open your eyes and look at the debate on academic  selection.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Sammy, you are sitting back to front, looking back to the  good old days, while everyone else looks towards the future. Those are the same  people who, unlike their Conservative counterparts in Britain or even  their friends in the Flat Earth Society, would like to retain the 11-plus for  the benefit of the working class. That is what Sammy Wilson tells us. Members  should check out the percentage of free school meals in grammar schools  compared to that in secondary schools &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>:  No. You will see where the working class &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Point of order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Is it not incumbent on the Minister,  when replying in a debate, to stick to the  points covered during that debate rather than comment on other issues?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: That is a matter for the Minister.  However, I ask the Minister to make her remarks through the Chair, please.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>:  Certainly, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The issues are linked;  they are the same issues. They concern working-class children and those  with special needs. Sammy Wilson tells us that if he does not get his way, a  breakaway education system for those grammar schools that cannot contemplate  change will be set up. Again, he is obviously concerned about the working  class.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Will working-class  people be able to afford the fees? I  will not allow children&rsquo;s education to become a political football. If  any Member wishes, they can work with me on devising and implementing the  programme for change that is needed if we are to create a modern,  fit-for-purpose and world-class education system. I will not stint on my  endeavours to facilitate those Members. If,  on the other hand, I see Members posturing week after week,  grandstanding for the media and trying to score cheap political points,  regardless of the damage that that would do to the morale or well-being of  children, parents and staff, I would not hesitate to expose them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Having said that, I am concerned that since June&rsquo;s debate  on the matter, and, despite my meetings with management and unions, there has  been no real progress in finding a resolution. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>: I  was asked about the meetings that have occurred. Meetings between chief  executives, board and union officials took place on Friday, and there was a  further meeting with management representatives this morning. Having listened  to what has been said today, I plan to intervene. I am now calling on the  employing authorities to implement the new grades as swiftly as possible in  order that, as a result of the systematic job evaluation process that was  carried out, those valuable members of staff receive the rates of pay to which  they are entitled. Classroom assistants have already had to wait an  unacceptable length of time. We must get the money to them that they deserve.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Equally, there is nothing to be gained from the proposed  industrial action. That can only disrupt children&rsquo;s education and result in  loss of income for the staff concerned. I urge classroom assistants to call off  the proposed strike.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>:  No. I do not have time, and I have a lot more to say.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am also calling on the employers and the unions to meet  today to resolve equitably the remaining differences. Although that would  conclude the matter, which is essential, not least because of the interests of  the staff concerned, I do not regard it as the ultimate solution. The issues  that have arisen are part of a bigger picture.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We need to take a wider and more fundamental look at our  approach to the planning and management of our schools&rsquo; education workforce. We  should examine the roles and responsibilities of all the main groups and  maximise the contributions of each so that pupils get the benefit of the skills  and expertise that all teaching staff bring. I have asked officials to draw up  the terms of reference for such a review, with the aim of making progress as  soon as is practicable. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  It is nice to see that the Minister, who did not have any time to accept  interventions from the SDLP or anyone else, was able to spend 30% of her time  attacking me about my attitude to, among other matters, academic selection, the  working class, the Irish language, equality, and the treatment of women.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>: No; I only have five minutes. I will not give way, nor will I  attack the Member, so she need not worry.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister says that she wants to deal seriously with  this issue, yet she spends 30% of her speech addressing  her comments to another Member on subjects that are not being discussed.  If I were as paranoid as Mr Butler, I would think that she were carrying out a  witch hunt. However, I am not paranoid. I am quite happy for her to make those  sorts of comments. That is what we expect to happen here. However, I will not  take lectures from the Minister that Members on this side of the House are not  concerned, or are expressing only pseudoconcern, about the matter.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McCrea, a Member for Lagan Valley, tabled the motion  because, in spite of the promise that the Minister made on 19 June &mdash; which was  over three months ago &mdash; when she thought that the matter was urgent, it has dragged on and has still not been  resolved. She can point the finger at  the Committee for Education and the Assembly and ask what they have  done.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We are not the employers. We are not even the paymasters.  The Minister is the Minister &mdash; she is the one who is responsible. We have no role  in the negotiations.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That is one of the reasons why I do not accept the  amendment tabled by the Member for East Belfast Dawn Purvis. It is not the job  of this Assembly or of its individual Members to get involved in the minutiae  of negotiations between employers and employees. To go down that route would  drag us into almost every trade union dispute in the public sector, and perhaps  even the private sector as well. That is not our role. Our role is to ensure  that, where an issue is important, the Minister  gives it appropriate priority in her Department, in her dealings, and in  her allocation of the finances that are available to her.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Clearly, this Minister has not done that. Since 19 June, on  something that we were told was urgent, she has had two meetings, one with each  side. She has clearly not given the matter  any priority in her financial dealings. As far as I know, the &pound;30  million that was available has not been upped. In the meantime &mdash; true to form,  I am going to mention it &mdash; she has found plenty of money to hand out for her  favourite project, the promotion of the Irish language. Mainstream education  and the concerns of youngsters with special needs across Northern Ireland,  and of those who deal with them, take second place in this Minister&rsquo;s priorities  behind the promotion of her own political ideology and the things that she  wants to promote.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That is why the motion is appropriate, and those who  proposed it should not be ashamed of doing so. It is the job of this House to  ensure that the Minister, who is responsible for the education budget and who  can &mdash; and who promised to &mdash; intervene between the boards and the trade unions  does so. She has not done that, and that is why the dispute has dragged on. The  amendment tabled by my colleague from Lagan Valley Jeffrey Donaldson seeks to  give some direction to the talks among the boards, the trade unions and the  Minister. At the end of the day, I am not ashamed to say that I brought this  issue up on a number of occasions before  devolution in the House of Commons. Here in the Assembly, I have done  what I can. Through the Education Committee, I have pushed the Minister. Let no  one run away with the idea &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  I have only got &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  You will get an extra minute.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  Yes; I will give way.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Sorry, your time is up.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Purvis</strong>: I  have listened to all the contributions today, and one thing is clear: everyone  cares about the classroom assistants, the valuable job that they do in the education  system, and the care and attention that they lavish on our children.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I was very disappointed  by some of the contributions, which amounted to point-scoring. I was  somewhat disappointed by Mr Butler&rsquo;s claim that Members are coming to this  matter late; that was disingenuous. My predecessor, David Ervine, stood on  picket lines at Tor   Bank School,  and other Members, such as Mrs Iris Robinson, have campaigned for that school.  Whether or not Members come to this issue late, they are still coming to it. That  is a sign of the lobbying power of the classroom assistants and the trade  unions in recent months. Even if we come late, it is important that we come and  lend our support. It was disingenuous of Mr Butler to say that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to reflect on what Mr Shannon said. People do not  take strike action lightly &mdash; they come to it as a last resort. Parents,  classroom assistants and principals do not want a strike. I discussed classroom  assistants with a principal last week, and she said that they cannot be blamed for  wanting to strike. They are crucial to the  system, but they are not valued accordingly. That is what the debate is  about.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For obvious reasons, I cannot support the motion: it is too  weak; it does not do anything; and it does not move the issue forward. That is why Sinn F&eacute;in supports the  motion. During the debate in June, the Minister was asked to intervene.  However, no progress has been made since then.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I cannot support the DUP amendment, because it does not do  anything more to progress the issue. The four items that it lists have been  discussed at length. They have been on the agenda at every negotiation that has  taken place between management and trade unions, but we have not got anywhere.  No one wants to strike; strike action is a last resort. The classroom  assistants do not want to strike, but their hand has been forced. Some people  really do not get it.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I have been trying to make an intervention; this is third time lucky for me.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">None of us was comforted by the Minister&rsquo;s promise in her  lecture to the House that she would instruct her officials to implement the  grades that are currently on offer. Therefore, we are no further forward.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Purvis</strong>: I  thank the Member for her intervention. Really, the Minister has said that she  will forge ahead anyway and introduce management&rsquo;s pay evaluation whether  classroom assistants like it or not. That is not the way forward; it does not  let people know that they and their contributions are valued. The matter will  not be resolved until the Minister directs management to enter into  negotiations with the trade unions to come up with an equitable, fair and just  settlement and pay evaluation for classroom  assistants, to use the Minister&rsquo;s own words and those of other Members  here today. We need to get people talking, but we also need to get them  negotiating a fair deal for classroom assistants.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Members will know that business must be suspended for Question  Time, which begins at 2.30 pm. Therefore, this debate will resume at 4.10 pm.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The debate stood suspended.</p>

	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="7"></a>Oral Answers to Questions</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First  Minister</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Lifetime Opportunities</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mrs  McGill </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister  to outline the status of &lsquo;Lifetime Opportunities: Government&rsquo;s Anti-Poverty and Social Inclusion Strategy for Northern  Ireland&rsquo;; and to give a timescale within which it will be presented to  the Executive for consideration.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO167/08>(AQO 167/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy First  Minister (Mr M McGuinness)</strong>: Section 16 of the Northern Ireland (St Andrew&rsquo;s  Agreement) Act 2006 places a statutory obligation on the Executive Committee to adopt a strategy setting out how  they propose to tackle poverty, social exclusion and patterns of  deprivation based on objective need. The process to obtain Executive Committee  agreement on an anti-poverty strategy has begun, and Ministers are examining  the lifetime opportunities strategy and hope to bring a revised paper to the  Executive later this year.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Given that the eradication of poverty  is a well-documented and agreed priority for Government, how will resources be  earmarked and channelled proactively in pursuance of this priority?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy First  Minister</strong>: The skewing of resources and  efforts towards those in greatest objective need by Departments is seen  as an effective way of ensuring that measures to combat poverty and social exclusion are implemented and, ultimately,  mainstreamed within public expenditure, planning and resource  allocations.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  What measures has the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First  Minister put in place, through its challenge function, to ensure that all  Departments allocate appropriate resources towards addressing rural poverty and  disadvantage, particularly as those issues  should be dealt with by all Departments, not just the Department of  Agriculture and Rural Development?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy First  Minister</strong>: Section 16 of the Northern    Ireland (St Andrew&rsquo;s Agreement) Act 2006  places a statutory obligation on the Executive to adopt a strategy on how the  matter should be taken forward. While poverty and multiple-deprivation tend to  be concentrated in urban areas, rural communities are also at risk, with high levels of deprivation in less  accessible rural areas. To that end, the Executive are committed to  ensuring that the adopted strategy will address the poverty and social  exclusion encountered in urban and rural areas.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Agriculture and Rural Develop&shy;ment&rsquo;s  vision of a thriving and sustainable rural community and environment means  that, effectively, it has engaged in many activities that will directly and  indirectly tackle rural poverty.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As the Member is a farmer, he will be aware that  agriculture continues to play an important economic role in the rural economy. The Department of Agriculture and  Rural Development will strive to increase the economic sustainability of all  farm businesses and will work in conjunction with other Departments towards the  elimination of poverty in rural areas. The Depart&shy;ment of Agriculture and Rural  Development obtained EU approval for its 2007-2013 rural development programme  on 24 July. That programme will put more than &pound;500 million into rural areas  over the next six years, with a focus on improving the competitiveness of the  farming industry, the environment and the quality of life in rural areas.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Will the Deputy First Minister assure the House that the strategy will be  supported by a dedicated budget? Will he give us an assessment of the North&rsquo;s  progress towards the targets contained in the lifetime opportunities document,  which was released by the then Secretary of State in November 2006?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy First  Minister</strong>: As the Member rightly said, &lsquo;Lifetime Opportunities: Government&rsquo;s  Anti-Poverty and Social Inclusion Strategy for Northern Ireland&rsquo; was launched by  the then Secretary of State, Peter Hain, in November 2006. The strategy  replaced New TSN, which was the Government&rsquo;s  formal high-level policy for tackling poverty and social exclusion in  the North. All those issues are under discussion.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive, and the respective Ministers, are giving  much consideration to those issues. The process to obtain the Executive  Committee&rsquo;s agreement on the strategy has begun; proposals are currently being cleared at an official level, with a view that  the Executive Committee will consider all of them at a meeting in  October. When the outcome of that becomes clear, I will be able to give more  comprehensive answers.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Honours List: Local Alternative</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr  Dallat </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister  to detail plans for a local alternative to the Honours List for recognising  people who, at work or in a voluntary capacity, have made an outstanding contribution  to society in general, or individuals in particular.&nbsp; <a name=AQO144/08>(AQO 144/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy First  Minister</strong>: Honours are an excepted matter, and are not within the competence  of the Assembly. The introduction of a local civic-award system, in addition to the honours process, is  something that the Assembly may wish to consider further at a later  date.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>: I  thank the Deputy First Minister for his answer. If the Assembly does consider  an alternative to the honours system, will it recognise people from the South  who have made outstanding achievements in the North? Also, will it be  transparent and accountable?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy First  Minister</strong>: The honest answer is that it is too soon to tell. A local  alternative to the honours system is not a high priority for the Assembly at  present, given all the other pressing measures to be dealt with between now and  Christmas &mdash; particularly budgetary considerations, investment strategies and  the priorities that the Executive and the Assembly will want to concentrate on.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There has been widespread recognition by the Assembly of  the achievements of cricketers; Gaelic footballers; the Derry  cam&oacute;gs, who won the all-Ireland junior championship two weeks ago; Rory  McIlroy, who performed well in the British  Open golf champion&shy;ship, and Padraig Harrington from the South, who won that same championship. All those types of  achievement will be discussed in  detail if the Assembly has a real debate on the issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Were we to reach a point of considering a local <span style="letter-spacing:-.25pt; ">alternative to the honours system, it would have  validity </span>only if it ensured recognition of the unsung heroes of our  process, governmental structures and system &mdash; such as teachers and nurses &mdash; who  perhaps contribute in a more meaningful way than the stars of our society.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Given that the existing honours list retains widespread support from all  communities in Northern Ireland,  and that the issue strikes at the heart of the debate over national  sovereignty, will the Deputy First Minister clarify his view on the current  political status of Northern Ireland  in the United Kingdom? <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy First  Minister</strong>: That is a cracker. The Member is to be admired for asking a  question about the honours list, avoiding the issue and turning it into a wholly political question about the constitutional  position of the North. The Good Friday Agreement and the St Andrews  Agreement both exist, and many matters have been settled by debate, without  prejudice to the political aspirations of  any Member. Rather than become embroiled in a controversial debate with  the Member, I will leave the matter at that.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>: Can the Deputy First Minister confirm that awards are made by  Her Majesty the Queen to people from all sectors in society? Can he also tell  the House what percentage of those awards go to people in the community,  voluntary and local-services sectors?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy First Minister</strong>: As I said in my previous answer, although  awards are not in the competence of the Assembly, or indeed the Executive, they  are made to all sectors of society, covering business, sport, arts, media,  health, education, public service and the voluntary and community sectors.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Approximately 60% of awards here go to people in the  community, voluntary and local-services sectors, and any member of the public  may nominate someone for an award. Some 50% of awards are made to people who  have been publicly nominated.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Rights of Older People</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Mr Brady </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister how it  will ensure that the rights of older people are effectively protected and  promoted. <a name=AQO159/08>(AQO 159/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy First  Minister</strong>: The Office of the First Minister  and the Deputy First Minister is fully committed to protecting and  promoting the rights of all citizens &mdash; including older people. To that end, the  Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister introduced  regulations last October, which prohibit discrimination in employment on  grounds of age.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Equality Commission has played a vital role in  promoting awareness of the new legislation and has produced guidance designed  to help employers and employees understand their rights and responsibilities.  We are also examining whether the establishment of a dedicated commissioner  post will add to protecting and promoting  the rights of older people. Conclusions on that matter will be put to  the Executive as soon as possible.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: I  thank the Deputy First Minister for his answer.  Go raibh maith agat. Will there be an independent element to the deliberations on the rights of  older people?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy First  Minister</strong>: An independent organisation, or individual, will be appointed to  assist in the work, and Members will recognise that that is an important  dimension as we move forward with what is, undoubtedly, an area of tremendous  concern in the Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: The  Deputy First Minister said that conclusions  regarding the commissioner will be brought to the Executive in due  course. When will proposals be brought to the Executive?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy First  Minister</strong>: Our consideration will be completed by the end of the year, and a  report will be submitted to Ministers for consideration. A decision will be  made by the Executive early in the new year.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  Will the Deputy First Minister outline the  distinctions between the Executive&rsquo;s approach to protecting the rights  of older people and that of the previous direct rule Administration?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy First  Minister</strong>: Recently, the First Minister and I have often gone on public  record and criticised various aspects of direct rule and direct rule Ministers.  There is no doubt that the Executive are determined to do things differently to  ensure that we &mdash; as locally accountable Ministers and MLAs &mdash; are totally  responsive to the needs of our older citizens. As <span style="letter-spacing:-.35pt; ">we move forward with this process, we will be conscious</span> of our responsibilities in this area and  to the older generation.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Equality Impact Assessments</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Ms Anderson </strong>asked the Office of the  First Minister and the Deputy First Minister to outline its position in  relation to equality impact assessments for all &lsquo;high-level&rsquo; policies.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO166/08>(AQO 166/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy First Minister</strong>: Equality considerations must be  mainstreamed into all decisions, including high-level or over-arching policies  and strategies. As the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First  Minister is the Department with co-ordinating responsibility for equality, its  policy is to subject all high-level policy emanating from Departments, in which  equality issues have been identified via the screening stage, to a full  equality impact assessment in line with section 75 responsibilities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First  Minister continues to offer advice to Departments on all aspects of the  implementation of section 75. Departments are responsible for ensuring that  equality of opportunity has been properly mainstreamed and for providing such  assurances to Ministers.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.  Will the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister be developing a transparent process for  equality impact assessments for high-level policies and strategies?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy First Minister</strong>: The Equality Commission will be working  with officials in the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First  Minister and the other Depart&shy;ments in the  coming months to develop an agreed approach &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member should know that points of order are not taken during Question Time,  but I will be happy to take points of order after Question Time.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy First  Minister</strong>: I will start again. The Equality Commission will be working with  officials in the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister and  the other Departments in the coming months to develop an agreed process for  equality-impact assessing all high-level policies and strategies.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>:  Will the Minister outline the position of the Office of the First Minister and  the Deputy First Minister on screening all policies for their impact on good  relations, and will he also confirm that equality and the creation of a shared  future do not threaten, but actually reinforce, each other?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy First  Minister</strong>: Members can be assured that all such matters, including those  raised by Naomi Long, will be subject to the agreed approaches and mechanisms.  It is clear that the section 75 obligations are bearing down on all  Departments.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Donaldson</strong>: Surely, one of the high-level policies and priorities for the  Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister is adequate funding  and support for the victims of violence in Northern Ireland. Will the Minister  agree with me that the more equality impact assessments we have, the more  resources have to be diverted to them? Would it not be better to give the money  to those who deserve it &mdash; the innocent victims of terrorist violence in Northern Ireland,  who have suffered for too long?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy First  Minister</strong>: The First Minister and I have  made it clear on countless occasions that victims are a top priority for  the Executive. I do not know how it can be said that we are not diligent enough  when we carry out equality impact assessments on a wide range of issues. Given  the nature of our Government, the processes that all parties have signed up to,  and the St Andrews Agreement, there is a responsibility on all of us in the way  ahead to ensure fairness in Government.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">North/South Ministerial Council: Secretariat Accommodation</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mr  McElduff </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First  Minister what action is being taken to provide accommodation that is fit for  purpose for the secretariat of the North/South Ministerial Council.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO154/08>(AQO 154/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy First  Minister</strong>: A business case and economic appraisal that was completed in 2006  confirmed that the present North/South Ministerial Council joint-secretariat  accommodation does not meet the operational requirements of the secretariat,  and it recommended that suitable alternative accommodation in the Armagh area be identified. Earlier this year, expressions  of interest were sought from those willing to provide accommodation for the  secretariat. Several tenders were received and have been evaluated. A full  report will be provided to the Council later in the year, when it may be asked  to approve the preferred bidder and agree  that contractual arrangements should be made.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. The Deputy First Minister is aware  that as well as tabling a question for oral answer a fortnight ago, I pressed  him on the issue last week following his statement on the North/South  Ministerial Council. Will the Deputy First Minister be more precise, if  possible, about the timing for the completion of the project, because the North/South Ministerial Council&rsquo;s  secretariat needs every encouragement and every facility to carry out  its important work?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy First  Minister</strong>: I agree that the Council&rsquo;s work is very important, and those of  us who have visited its headquarters in Armagh  over the past six or seven years are aware that it is based in totally  unsuitable accommodation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Later this year, the North/South Ministerial Council may be  asked to approve the preferred bidder and agree that contractual agreements  should be made. Following the award of a contract, construction and fitting out  will take approximately two years with the aim of having accommodation late in  2009.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  Does the Deputy First Minister agree that, although accommodation for the  secretariat is very important, the substance of North/South co-operation is  even more important? Can he now, unlike last week, tell the House who the two  independent, external people to be appointed by the Executive as part of the  efficiency review of the North/South implementation bodies will be? Does he  know who the two individuals to be appointed by the Irish Government are? Will  the Deputy First Minister give the House a cast-iron guarantee that this  so-called efficiency review will complete its work within six months, as  indicated last week in his statement to the House? Given the concern about  whether the review will be completed within six months, is the Deputy First  Minister not concerned that the review will slow down North/South co-operation  and ultimately suffocate North/South developments on the island?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy First  Minister</strong>: In my statement last week on the North/South Ministerial Council  meeting in which we participated earlier this year in Armagh,  I made it clear that the efficiency review was a work in progress. The First  Minister and I &mdash; and the Executive &mdash; have not yet  decided on the individuals who will take that matter forward. However, I  expect that that will happen in due course.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Attwood&rsquo;s question became a speech. He needs to  recognise that other Members have tabled questions, and I am trying to get  through as many as I can.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">EU Regional Development Committee</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">6. <strong>Mr  McCartney </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First  Minister to give an assessment of the recent meeting with the European Union  Regional Development Committee; and the importance  of ongoing contact with the European Union.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO91/08>(AQO 165/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy First  Minister</strong>: I, along with the Minister of  Finance and Personnel, and my Department&rsquo;s junior Ministers, were  delighted to welcome such an influential European Parliament Committee to the  House. That visit was another indication of the interest shown by the European  institutions in our work to create a more peaceful and prosperous society.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The EU Regional Development Committee has played a  significant role, and we have received substantial funds to build a better  future for all. I thank that Committee and our MEPs for their past and  continued support in securing structural funds for this region, particularly  the Peace programmes and Europe&rsquo;s contribution to the International Fund for Ireland. The  meeting was a good opportunity to tell the Committee that we intend to  participate fully as an EU region, and that the funding available under our EU  rural development programme for 2007-13 would contribute to the creation of a  dynamic, enterprising and innovative economy here.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The work of the European Commission Task Force announced by  President Barroso on 1 May 2007 is also important. That will help to redefine  our relationship with Europe as funding levels  to the more-established member states reduce following the enlargement of the  European Union.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The First Minister and I welcome wider political  involvement with Europe through the Barroso task force, and it will be  important for the Executive to maintain its visibility in Brussels. To that end, we hope to undertake a  joint visit to Brussels  to meet with President Barroso and other influential figures later in the year.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. Will the Deputy First Minister provide us with progress on  the Barroso task force?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy First Minister</strong>: The task force comprises a team of senior officials from relevant EU  Commission Directorates General and has met on four occasions to identify key representatives and to develop a  work plan. The rural development programme has been finalised and the  structural fund programme will be agreed by the end of September.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In July, I led a ministerial delegation comprising myself  and junior Ministers Gerry Kelly and Ian Paisley Jnr to meet Mr Nicholas Van  der Pas, Director General for Employment and Social Affairs and Equal  Opportunities in the European Commission. We discussed with him and his team  the various policy strands relevant to the work of the task force. We also met  Bobby McDonagh, head of the Irish permanent representation and Kim Darroch,  head of the UK  permanent representation, both of whom pledged their full and active support  for the Barroso task force.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister for Social Development, Margaret Ritchie, will  be visiting Brussels  in October in support of our participation  in the European week of regions and cities open days, and she will also  take the opportunity to meet with Danuta  H&uuml;bner, Commissioner for Regional Policy. Commissioner H&uuml;bner and other  members of the task force hope to visit us during the autumn. A progress report  of the work plan will be prepared by the Commission towards the end of this  year, and the Minister of Finance and Personnel will share that plan with his  Executive colleagues in due course.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName" style="margin-top:6.5pt;"><strong>Lord Browne</strong>: In light of the task force announce&shy;ment, what  outcomes does the Deputy First Minister hope to achieve by the end of the year?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName" style="margin-top:6.5pt;"><strong>The Deputy First Minister</strong>: It is hard to say at this stage.  However, we had a very constructive meeting with President Barroso when he came  here. It was obvious that he was very anxious to help in whatever way he could.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText" style="margin-top:6.5pt;">At their meeting on 8 June,  Commissioner for Regional Policy Danuta  H&uuml;bner, the Minister of Finance Mr Robinson and the First Minister  discussed the reasons for the task force&rsquo;s work. The main outcomes were that,  by the end of the year, we hope to have completed a stocktaking study of the  available EU initiatives; under&shy;stand how those initiatives could meet key economic  requirements; seek to finalise the rural development,  fisheries and structural fund programmes; make arrange&shy;ments to extend  the exchange of officials programme; and initiate a programme of meetings with  Commissioners and senior Commission officials in order to build relationships.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName" style="margin-top:6.5pt;"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>: I thank the Deputy First Minister for his reply. I  note the good and important work of the task force and that the First Minister  and the Deputy First Minister have shed their opposition to the European Union  and are embracing it enthusiastically. I commend that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText" style="margin-top:6.5pt;">Will they now consider working  with the Republic&rsquo;s Government to get even greater funding for Northern Ireland?  If united, the Government in the Republic  of Ireland and the Executive will be able to achieve greater  leverage, funding and support for Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName" style="margin-top:6.5pt;"><strong>The Deputy First Minister</strong>: Obviously. The Assembly must have as  much support and as many friends as possible. The First Minister has said that  on several occasions. President Barroso&rsquo;s visit to this Building occurred  chiefly as a result of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s encouragement. To gain the greatest  advantage for the people we represent, we must use all the resources and good  will that are available to us. I have no doubt that the people we work with in  the Irish Government will be our friends at court.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Children and Young People</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">7. <strong>Ms  Ramsey </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister  to outline how the junior Ministers will address the issue of children and  young people.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO161/08>(AQO 161/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy First  Minister</strong>: The junior Ministers are assisting the First Minister and me to  take forward our important commitments and priorities with regard to children  and young people. They will have a key role in driving the 10-year strategy for  children and young people and in setting in  place the most appropriate arrangements for its delivery.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Along with the First Minister and me, the junior Ministers  have already met with the Commissioner for Children and Young People and have  begun a series of meetings with non-governmental organisations. A further  schedule of visits, to take place in the autumn, is being arranged with  organisations that work with children and young people. That will help to  inform us of the key issues that face children and young people.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I also wish to place on record my thanks to Ms Ramsey and  other representatives of the all-party group on children and young people for  their positive contribution to this agenda. It is important that we find an  appropriate way for that role and engagement to continue.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Deputy First Minister  for his answer. I wish to place on record my thanks for his personal commitment  to children and young people, ensuring that they remain centre stage, and also  for the commitment of the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First  Minister and the junior Ministers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Deputy First Minister highlight the key priorities  that will emerge from the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy First  Minister</strong>: Our key priorities are: eradicating poverty and closing the gap  between those who do well in life and those who do not; safeguarding and  protecting children and young people; developing their full potential;  fulfilling our commitments under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of  the Child; improving the health and well-being of children and young people;  developing mechanisms to allow for meaningful participation of children and  young people; and providing future generations with a safe and pleasant  environment in which to grow.</p>

	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  As Mr Boylan is not in the Chamber, we will move on to question 2.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Giant&rsquo;s Causeway  Visitors&rsquo; Centre</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr  McGlone </strong>asked the Minister of the Environ&shy;ment what discussions she has had  with her colleagues in the Executive concerning the proposed Giant&rsquo;s   Causeway Visitors&rsquo; Centre; and whether there are future  plans to hold such discussions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO180/08>(AQO 180/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment (Mrs Foster)</strong>: As I  informed the Environment Committee last Thursday, I have had two  meetings with Minister Dodds, at which proposals for new visitor facilities at  the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway were discussed. There are  no immediate plans for further discussions. I have not yet brought the only  planning application before me &mdash; from Seaport Investments Ltd &mdash; formally to the  attention of the Executive Committee, because I have not yet finalised my  decision on the application.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have indicated that I see considerable merit in the  application before me, and I am minded to approve it. However, I have asked  officials to do further work on issues relating to the proposal, which will  involve discussions with the applicant and  with the key stake&shy;holders, namely Moyle District Council and the  National Trust.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that my  announcement will facilitate a mature debate between the interested  parties and that the outcome will be a visitors&rsquo; centre that we can all be  proud of. When I make my final decision, I will bring it to the attention of  the Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Just for the public record, has the junior  Minister Mr Paisley Jnr, or his office or advisers, discussed the matter  with your Department?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  I am happy to answer that question from the Chairman of the Environment  Committee. As he knows, I said clearly at last Thursday&rsquo;s Committee meeting  that I have had absolutely no representation from  the junior Minister, or anybody else, for or against the application. I  am happy to put that on the record.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>:  Given the strong objections that have already emerged from Moyle and Coleraine  councils, the National Trust and other stakeholders, and bearing in mind the  political sensitivities in the Chamber, there is a chance that the application  might go to the Planning Appeals Commission. If that happens, will the Minister  abide by the commission&rsquo;s decision?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  First, I have heard a lot of discussion about what I, as the Minister  responsible for planning, should or should not take into consideration in my  determination of the matter. Many of the matters that have been mentioned are  absolutely not matters that I should take into consideration when determining a  planning application. I want to make that very clear. I am very clear about my  ministerial role in planning.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  As there have been many reports in the local press over the last few weeks,  will the Minister clarify why she said that she was minded to approve the  proposal?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  I said that I was minded to approve the application because I see considerable  merit in it. It is the only application before me. The proposal, which is still  at outline stage, attempts to minimise the visual intrusiveness of the proposed  centre by covering roofs and exposed surfaces with grass and locating part of  the car park underground. It has an imaginative design, which provides for  extensive facilities, including an auditorium, cafe and library, and it  attempts to resolve the access issues with new road arrangements.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That said, I have not made a firm decision, because aspects  of the proposals must be given further consideration, including the impact on  the world heritage site and the centre&rsquo;s relationship to other development in  the area and to the existing visitors&rsquo; centre. Those are proper planning  matters that I have to deal with, and they will be taken into account when I  reach my final decision.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Road Safety Strategy</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Mr  Hamilton </strong>asked the Minister of the Environment to give an assessment of the  Northern Ireland Audit Office&rsquo;s report on Northern Ireland&rsquo;s Road Safety  Strategy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO156/08>(AQO 156/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  I welcome the report and I am pleased that it acknowledges the significant  progress made to date. There is always more that could be done, and I am  pleased that the report has identified some important issues for further  consideration. The report was considered by the Public Accounts Committee on 13  September 2007, and, following the Committee&rsquo;s report, the Department of the  Environment and the Department of Finance and Personnel will prepare a response  that will be provided to the Assembly. It would be inappropriate for me to  comment further until the response has been made available.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her reply on what is an important issue. We were  reminded of such tragedies overnight, with a fatal road accident on the Ballygowan Road  outside Comber, in my own Strangford constituency.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members welcomed the fact that the Minister made road  safety one of her top priorities when she first entered office. Will she provide an update on the progress of the  review of road safety strategy that she initiated?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  I offer my condolences in respect of the latest tragedy on our roads just last  night. There have been 79 deaths on our roads to date; which compares  favourably with last year, when there had been 89 deaths on our roads at this  stage. However, that does not take away from the human tragedy involved in any  individual road death.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My officials have commenced a full review of the road  safety strategy, and a number of my staff have been committed to the review on  a full-time basis. Significant progress has been made, but much more can be  done.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">An initial meeting has taken place with counterparts in the  Department for Regional Development and the Police Service of Northern Ireland  to discuss the way forward. Unfortunately, it is too early to indicate when the  review will be completed. However, the Department continues to make this a  priority, and that is reflected in all of my public announcements.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I call Mr John Dallat for a supplementary question.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>:  Mr Speaker, I do not have a supplementary question.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Listed Buildings</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mr A  Maskey </strong>asked the Minister of the Environ&shy;ment to detail the number of  listed buildings that have been destroyed in  the past five years; and what penalties and prosecutions have resulted  in relation to these offences.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO172/08>(AQO  172/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  Over the past five years, 12 listed buildings have been destroyed without the  appropriate listed building consent. In three cases no action was taken as the  buildings were destroyed accidentally by fire. In another three cases no action  was taken as the developer produced police reports to confirm that the  buildings were in a dangerous condition. Those buildings were demolished and  subsequently de-listed. In one instance a building was lost as a result of the  roof falling in, and prosecution was not pursued. In another instance a  developer was prosecuted for the demolition of two listed buildings in  Portstewart and was fined the princely sum of &pound;250 for each building. There is  ongoing enforcement action in respect of the remaining three cases, one of  which has been scheduled for a court hearing in November.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. I thank the Minister for her response. I know that she has  taken an interest in this issue in the past. Will she acknowledge that the demolition of buildings without the  appropriate listed building consent is an ongoing problem &mdash; certainly in  my constituency of South Belfast &mdash; and that there have been quite a number of  cases in which the Planning Service has given approval for the demolition of  listed buildings? Will she also ensure that more stringent measures are  included in any future planning legislation proposals to deal with listed  buildings and provide enforcement measures in the event of such buildings being  demolished without the appropriate permission?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  The Member is aware that I know of the difficulties in his constituency,  especially in relation to the Malone conservation area. There have also been  problems in North Belfast &mdash; one of the Members for North   Belfast, I think it was Mr Maginness, raised an issue in relation  to the Cavehill Road  during my previous Question Time.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Changes to the legislation were made in 2003 and 2006,  which brought enforcement powers in Northern   Ireland planning law largely into line with those in Great Britain.  The changes included increasing the level of fines for offences, and the  possibility of imprisonment. The legislation exists: the issue is whether the  judiciary will follow through as regards the level of fines &mdash; unfortunately I  have no control over that matter.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  Assuming the Minister&rsquo;s distaste at the possibility of a shrine at the  Maze/Long Kesh site, does she have any plans to de-list the buildings on that  site that are currently listed?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  I thank the Member for his question. He, and several members of his party,  wrote to me in relation to that matter. I  will be responding in due course, and the responses will be with them in  the near future.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>:  The Minister is aware that, in some areas of Northern Ireland, traditional  residential areas are being destroyed by apartment development. My South Belfast constituency has suffered probably more  than others. Does the Minister agree that the spread of apartment development  threatens the character of some traditional residential areas?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  I am aware of increasing public concern about apartment development and its  effect on the character of long-established residential areas arising from  policies in the regional development strategy and the Department for Regional  Develop&shy;ment&rsquo;s policy for housing and settlements.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The demand for apartment living reflects ongoing changes in  society, including the trend towards smaller households. As the Department that  is responsible for planning, my Department must cater for that trend. My  Department has published Planning Policy Statement 7 and Development Control  Advice Note 8 to assist in controlling that type of development.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am not sure whether the Member is aware that, on my  instruction, the Planning Service recently issued a circular to all its  professional planners in order to raise their awareness of the issue and  particularly that of the cumulative impact of apartment developments. My  officials are also liaising with Department for Regional Development officials  about the build-up of developments in existing residential areas.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Carbon Emissions</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mr Ford </strong>asked  the Minister of the Environment what is her assessment of the need to reduce  carbon emissions in Northern    Ireland, given the announcement by her  Scottish colleagues on the need for an 80% reduction in carbon emissions by  2050.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO183/08>(AQO 183/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  Although Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  emissions are minute in global terms, it is important that we play our part in  reducing them. That is why I sought, and received,  agreement at last week&rsquo;s Executive Committee meeting for the provisions  of the United Kingdom Climate Change  (Effects) Bill to be extended to Northern<span style="letter-spacing:0pt; "> </span>Ireland. That Bill provides for an overall United Kingdom  emissions reduction target of at least 60% by 2050.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am aware that, in addition to opting into the UK Bill, the Scottish Executive intend to produce a  separate climate change Bill that has a higher reduction target of 80%. There is no simple relationship between  long-term stabilisation and the pathways that are required to reach that point. The UK target of at least 60% reduction  in carbon dioxide emissions is consistent with that approach. However, it is  recognised that there is a need to keep targets under review in the light of  emerging scientific evidence and other developments. The Climate Change  (Effects) Bill will provide for that.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I thank the Minister for her reply, although it is a little  disappointing. Given the growing body of opinion that states that the UK needs  to reduce carbon emissions by at least 80% by 2050 and the fact that Northern Ireland, along with Scotland, has huge  potential to generate power from wind, waves and biomass, is it not time  that she ensured that Northern Ireland took a lead in the battle against  climate change and ceased to be a reluctant conscript?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  I do not accept that Northern    Ireland is a reluctant conscript; the  opposite is the case. The 60% target was recommended by the independent Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution and cited  in the 2003 White Paper on energy.  There has been considerable stakeholder consensus that that figure  represents an ambitious commitment for the UK; however, there is no similar  consensus on any other figure.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In evidence to the joint committee that scrutinised the  Bill in May, Professor Sir David King, the Government&rsquo;s scientific adviser,  recognised that 60% is the correct target at this stage. I want the Member to  reflect on that. Two weeks ago I had the opportunity to speak with Jonathon  Porritt, the chairman of the Sustainable Development Commission. I asked him  about the 60% target, because I knew it to be an issue for some here. Mr  Porritt is of the opinion that 60% is the correct target at this point;  however, he said that it should be left to the Committee on Climate Change to  revisit targets. Revisiting targets is built into the Bill, which states that  the target is at least 60%. However, the Committee on Climate Change could  raise that target if the need arises.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  Will the Minister tell us what cross-departmental meetings have taken place on  the reduction of carbon emissions and what action has been taken as a result?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  The Member knows that sustainable development lies in the remit of OFMDFM,  which is taking the lead on the matter. It  will also lead on reducing carbon emissions across the Government  estate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My own Department is leading the way, and I hope that it  will be carbon-neutral by 2010. I also hope that other Departments follow its  example.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>:  Will the Minister advise Members how Scotland arrived at the proposal of  a reduction of 80% for carbon emissions? Is there any merit in having specific  reductions for Northern    Ireland in the proposed climate change Bill?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  Hopefully, I have partly answered that when replying to Mr Ford&rsquo;s supplementary  question. Targets have no value unless they are realistic and achievable. Scotland has agreed to the target of 60% set by  the UK  climate change Bill. The Scots feel that they can go further and aim for a  target of 80% in the Scottish climate change Bill. The reason that Scotland, above  other UK Administrations, can do that is that there is a better provision of  natural resources, as well as carbon-dioxide-absorbing forests and heathlands,  and an abundant water supply for the production of hydroelectricity.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Scottish Administration believes that a higher domestic  target is achievable. The target in the UK climate change Bill is 60%, but  that may not be the ultimate target, and if the Joint Committee on Draft  Climate Change Bill decides that the target should be raised, then the Northern  Ireland Administration will take advice on that matter.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Built Heritage</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">6. <strong>Mr T Clarke </strong>asked the Minister of the  Environment what steps she is taking to support built heritage in Northern Ireland.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO191/08>(AQO 191/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>: I am determined to protect and promote the built heritage. Raising awareness, managing state-care  monuments, saving buildings at risk and paying grants to owners of listed  buildings are all important.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Recently, I launched the tenth anniversary of the  increasingly popular European heritage open day, an event designed to promote  our rich built heritage. The Proms in the Park event at Carrickfergus  Castle highlighted Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  important heritage to a wider audience. I have launched a conservation plan for  Derry&rsquo;s walls. That initiative will strengthen  the exemplary way that we seek to maintain  the monument, and its guardianship,  and indicates how the Department of the Environment intends to manage  the other 183 monuments in state care.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Environment and Heritage Service (EHS) has a database &mdash;  Register of Buildings at Risk in Northern Ireland &mdash; the aim of which  is to save 200 buildings by 2016. Last  year, 32 buildings were removed from  the register, including buildings such as Brownlow House in Lurgan, and  the Irish Society&rsquo;s Primary School in Coleraine.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of the Environment, through EHS, offers grant aid to owners of listed buildings.  The budget is &pound;2&middot;2 million, and we are reviewing that policy and hope to  make funding more widely available. That includes the proposal for a new  funding stream that will specifically target building preservation trusts. The  proposals are subject to scrutiny by the Department of Finance and Personnel and to the views of the Committee for the  Environment. In addition, during the last 12 months, 88 buildings have been  added to the list of buildings of special  architectural and historical interest.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, since I took office, two preservation notices have been issued, and two others confirmed. That  process is sometimes known as  spot-listing and enables potentially list-worthy buildings to be  protected from alteration or demolition for up to six months, to allow time for  detailed research before a final decision is taken on whether to list them.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  Will the Department of the Environ&shy;ment continue to delist buildings as part of  the second survey of historic buildings?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  The short answer is yes. To be listed, buildings must pass the statutory test  as set down in legislation &mdash; that is, they must be of special historical or  architectural interest. Those buildings that no longer meet the legislative  requirements must be delisted. However, as I have already said, over the last  12 months 88 buildings have been added to the list, and only 10 have been  removed. Many buildings have been added to the list as a result of the second  survey of historic buildings. Industrial buildings, vernacular houses and other  structures such as pumps, which were less valued in the first survey conducted  during the 1970s, are now better represented on the list.</p>

	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">7. <strong>Mr  Molloy </strong>asked the Minister of the Environ&shy;ment what progress is being made  in relation to the integration of the process for dealing with farm waste and  municipal waste.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO192/08>(AQO 192/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  The Northern Ireland waste  manage&shy;ment strategy is for all controlled waste, and, together with the  Department of the Environment&rsquo;s guidance on the best practical environmental  options for Northern Ireland,  forms a robust framework from which the three  district council waste partnerships have developed waste management  plans.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those plans  specifically provide for the management of all waste streams, whether  municipal, commercial or farm waste. The waste strategy notes the value of  exploiting any opportunities for the sharing of facilities to deal with both  farm and municipal waste. The waste management groups will consider possible  synergies when they procure facilities or services in relation to all  controlled waste in their area.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  Does the Minister agree that with the correct safeguards in place, an energy  fuel could be produced, either from gasification or solid fuel, to help to deal  with the wastes by bringing them together, while benefiting the community?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  I am aware of the Member&rsquo;s involve&shy;ment with one of the waste management  bodies, the Southern Waste Management Partnership, and with its proposals on  those issues. In the first instance, the selection of appropriate technology on  waste streams is a matter for the waste-management groups, which have come  forward with particular plans for dealing with that. It is then a matter for  the market, on a competitive basis, to determine a package of facilities that  will provide the waste-management groups  with an affordable solution. It is unlikely that a best-value solution  will be able to depend on a single waste stream; therefore, agricultural,  commercial and industrial wastes are likely to be treated along with municipal  waste.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Irwin</strong>:  Can the Minister tell the House whether district councils accept and collect  agricultural waste in the same way that they collect municipal waste?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  Yes, they do. Agricultural waste falls under the classification of industrial  waste in Northern Ireland.  The Waste and Contaminated Land (Northern    Ireland) Order 1997 allows district  councils, if requested, to collect commercial and industrial waste on payment  of charges. Civic amenity sites may also accept agricultural waste, and may  charge for doing so.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  I almost got the answer to my question in the Minister&rsquo;s last response. However,  is the Minister satisfied that all local authorities act according to the same  criteria when collecting waste or having waste disposed of at landfill sites? I  refer to the materials that they are allowed to dump and the charges that they  can make.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  All local authorities must comply with the requirements of The Waste Management  Regulations (Northern    Ireland) 2006 when dealing with agricultural  waste that they have been requested to collect for treatment or disposal.  However, if the Member is aware of any local government organisation that does  not comply with those regulations, I am willing to talk to him about that.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Question 8 has been withdrawn.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Recycling Levels</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">9. <strong>Mr P  Maskey </strong>asked the Minister of the Environment to detail the quantity of  glass, paper and card, and plastics that have been recycled in each of the past  two years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO169/08>(AQO 169/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  At present, the Department has no statutory  obligation to collect figures. However, I receive returns from district  councils on that matter. During 2004-05, the quantities of those materials that  were recycled were as follows: glass, 10,258 tonnes; paper and card, 23,906  tonnes, and plastic, 1,712 tonnes. In 2005-06, those quantities increased to  the following: glass, 13,107 tonnes; paper and card, 65,568 tonnes, and  plastic, 7,666 tonnes. I am delighted to note the significant increase in the  amounts that were recycled in 2005-06 compared with the previous year. That  reflects well on the commitment of councils, the private and voluntary sectors and individual householders to  increase the amount of waste that is recycled and thereby reduce the amount  that goes to landfill.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. What efforts will the Minister make to  enhance those figures and ensure long-term sustainability?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  I am sure that the Member is aware of the  Northern Ireland waste management strategy, which contains the following  recycling targets: 60% of commercial and industrial waste to be recycled by  2020; 75% of construction, demolition and excavation waste to be recycled or  reused by 2020; recycling and composting of household waste should be at 35% by  2010; 40% by 2015 and 45% by 2020. It is necessary to maximise recycling and composting practice in order to reduce  the amount of waste that is sent to landfill and, with regard to biodegradable  municipal waste, also to meet the challenging landfill directive targets.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Newton</strong>:  The Minister has provided impressive figures, which the House and the district  councils will welcome. However, can the Minster tell the House how those  figures will be monitored on a daily, weekly and monthly basis, so that the  Assembly is confident that those targets are being achieved?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  As I have already indicated, the Department does not have a statutory  obligation to collect those figures. However, that may change in the future.  The district councils submit their recycling data via the waste data flow  database system on a quarterly basis, two months after the end of each quarter.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The data are collected from bring sites, civic amenity  sites and kerbside collections. Information is gathered on 30 waste streams.  The Environment and Heritage Service audits and validates the data through  visits to district councils, 13 of which, to date, have been carried out this  year.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Question 10 has been withdrawn.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Planning Policy Statement 14 (PPS 14)</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">11. <strong>Mr McElduff </strong>asked the Minister of the  Environ&shy;ment if she will make a statement on planning applications  refused under Planning Policy Statement 14: Sustainable Development in the  Countryside.&nbsp; <a name=AQO148/08>(AQO 148/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">18. <strong>Mr Gardiner </strong>asked the Minister of the  Environ&shy;ment what discussions she has had with the Minister for Regional  Development regarding the establishment of new rural planning guidelines, in  the light of Mr Justice Gillen&rsquo;s ruling on Planning Policy Statement 14:  Sustainable Development in the Countryside. (AQO  150/08)</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  Mr Speaker, with your permission, I shall answer question 11 and question 18,  which is Mr Gardiner&rsquo;s question, together.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although the High Court has decided that the Department for  Regional Development does not have the power to prepare it to draft PPS 14, the  planning policy statement has not been formally quashed. A remedies hearing  will take place on 27 September 2007. The Planning Service currently holds all  planning applications that fall to be determined under PPS 14. The implications  for applications that have been refused, wholly or partly on the basis of PPS  14, will be considered in the light of the final court judgement. There are  about 600 such cases.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will now answer Mr Gardner&rsquo;s question. In light of the  High Court&rsquo;s recent judgment on the judicial review of PPS 14, I met Conor  Murphy, the Minister for Regional Development, on 10 September 2007 to discuss  the way forward. It was agreed that we would seek to place further evidence in  front of the court on the issue of remedies. That matter was heard before Mr Justice  Gillen on Friday 14 September 2007, when the Department for Regional  Development was afforded a further week in which to submit additional evidence.  As I have already stated, a further hearing on the issue of remedies is  scheduled for 27 September 2007.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Does the Minister accept that PPS 14,  which is effectively a blanket ban on building in the countryside, has proven  to be totally disastrous for the entire rural community? Does she also accept  that refusals that were issued after 16 March 2006, on the basis of PPS 14  criteria, are now unlawful and invalid? How are those applications to be  reviewed, and does PPS 14 still pertain?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  I thought that I had made it clear &mdash; perhaps I did not &mdash; in my answer to the  Member that applications that came before the Planning Service to be determined  between March 2006 and the present still stand. At present, that is our legal  advice, and I have no reason to demur. I am sure that the Member has read the judgement  from Mr Justice Gillen in full. It is interesting that Mr Justice Gillen made  no comment on the content of PPS 14. The crux of the judgement related to which  Department made PPS 14, not to the content of the policy.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her response. Does the Minister accept that  considerations of sustainability, rural economy, family cohesion, social need,  affordability and landscape compatibility should all be good reasons, either  separately or in various combinations, for permitting development in the  countryside, and that that rationale approach would be preferable to the  mindless activity of PPS 14 and the chaos that has followed its demise?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  I am sure that the Member is aware that a ministerial subgroup was set up to  deal with the whole issue of PPS 14. Before the new devolved Administration  took power on 8 May 2007, there had been a number of discussions in the House  on what should be in a new PPS 14, both in the Committee on the Programme for  Government and in the House. All those matters will be taken into consideration  when the ministerial subgroup convenes. We have not proceeded with a  ministerial subgroup meeting, but work has been done in the background with  which we shall not proceed until the outcome of the appeal on Thursday 27  September 2007.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>: I  am sure that the Minister is aware that if  the courts finally quash PPS 14, that will put enormous strains on the  Planning Service. Is the Minister minded to put in place contingency plans,  ready to be used, should that eventually happen?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  Yes, I am minded to do so. Thank you very much for that wording, Mr Wells.  Enormous strain will be placed on the operational side of Planning Service, as  and when that decision is made.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Approximately 4,500 PPS 14 applications were received after  16 March 2006, up to early September 2007 &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I must interrupt the Minister as Question Time is now over for her.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading"><a name="9"></a>Finance and Personnel</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Local and Regional Rates</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mr K  Robinson </strong>asked the Minister of Finance and Personnel to detail the total  amount raised in local and regional rates, both household and industrial, by  (a) council area; and (b) parliamentary constituency, in the past five years;  and to detail the amount of rebate paid out on the same basis.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO151/08>(AQO 151/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel (Mr P Robinson)</strong>: I would have been happy to spend the  next 30 minutes answering this question, but instead I placed tables in the  Library showing the detailed information requested. The Land and Property Services  Agency does not hold these figures by parliamentary constituency, so I provided  the information on the basis of council area.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member for East Antrim  asked for figures for household and industrial rates. We have taken that to  mean domestic and non-domestic rates, as the category of industrial rates is  only a small percentage of all non-domestic properties, and figures are not  readily available for that subset.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member will be interested to note the following from  the figures for 2006-07: in the Carrickfergus Borough council area, &pound;7&middot;7  million was raised in local rates, and some &pound;10 million in regional rates. Over  &pound;1 million was refunded by way of rate rebate. In the Larne Borough Council  area, &pound;7&middot;4 million was raised in local rates, and some &pound;9&middot;2 million in regional  rates, with some &pound;1&middot;2 million being refunded by way of rate rebate. In  Newtownabbey Borough Council area, in the other part of his constituency, &pound;18&middot;7  million was raised in local rates, and some &pound;24&middot;6 million in regional rates.  Some &pound;2&middot;6 million was refunded by way of rate rebate.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his full reply, and I look forward to reading the  documents that he placed in the Library. Does the Minister agree that a  significant proportion of the regional rates for a local government area should  be spent in that area, as local rates currently are? Will he indicate what he  considers to be a reasonable proportion?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  The regional rate is not a hypo&shy;thecated  rate. I can understand, arising out of contributions by his friend in  the Workplace 2010 debate, the concern that is being expressed, particularly by  those in East Antrim. Off the top of my head  this morning, I said that my understanding was that Larne, which is in the East Antrim constituency, came out lowest in the indices  for public-sector jobs. I checked those figures &mdash; I was right, as usual. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The figures for public-sector jobs per 100 economically  active people ranged from Larne at 10&middot;4 to Belfast at 53&middot;2. Again,  the figures that were originally given show that the Belfast travel-to-work area had 28&middot;1  public-sector jobs per 100 economically active people. It disguises the fact  that the whole of East Antrim is at 10&middot;1, Ards is at 11&middot;1, Newtownabbey  is at 13&middot;1 and North Down is at 13&middot;6. The low level in those areas &mdash; not  surprisingly &mdash; means that Belfast  is at 53&middot;2. Again, the disparity is evident, particularly in the outlying areas  of the Belfast  travel-to-work area, which makes more complex the kind of decisions that we  have to take with regard to job dispersal.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  How much of the domestic rate currently goes towards paying for water? If the  Minister does not have that information at this point, can he confirm that he  will bring that information to the Assembly and say when he will do so?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  Again, people are testing me &mdash; I am giving these figures off the top of my  head. The answer at the moment is, of  course, none &mdash; because at the time of the last Executive, his colleague  Mark Durkan decided to break the link  between water and the regional rate. I believe that the present-day  equivalent of the figure at that time would be, on average, about &pound;160.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  Can the Minister set out the percentage increase in the domestic regional rate  over that period, the reasons for that increase, and whether he believes that  such increases are sustainable.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  My colleagues are supposed to ask me easy questions, not hard ones. The  percentage increases to which the Members referred occurred over a five-year  period. For the past three years I calculate a 37% increase, which is a  sizeable figure. Over five years the increase is approximately 60%, largely  brought about by the negotiations of those involved in the Belfast Agreement  with the reinvestment and reform initiative, which tied rate increases in Northern Ireland to the level of increases in Great Britain.  That made for substantial increases; thankfully, we managed to break that link  during the St Andrews Agreement negotiations, and are, therefore, no longer  tied to the increases in Great Britain.  The Executive can now make more reasonable decisions on rates.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Lifetime Opportunities</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr Ford </strong>asked  the Minister of Finance and Personnel to detail the resources he has allocated  to tackle rural poverty across Northern Ireland, and to meet the targets set  out in &lsquo;Lifetime Opportunities: <span style="letter-spacing:-.3pt; ">Government&rsquo;s  Anti-Poverty and Social Inclusion Strategy&rsquo;</span>, given the ongoing  comprehensive spending review.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO184/08>(AQO 184/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  The UK comprehensive  spending review is due to conclude in October, and will have important  implications for us in determining the share of UK public expenditure to be  allocated over the next three years to the Executive and Assembly for those  public services for which we are responsible.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have not yet made any resource allocations for consideration by the Executive. Draft spending  proposals put forward by Departments as part of the 2007 Budget process  were informed by a broad range of issues, including the need to address social  exclusion and poverty. I held bilateral meetings with Ministers last week in  order to develop a Budget position. That will provide me with a basis to produce  spending proposals for individual  Departments for discussion and agreement at a subsequent Executive  meeting.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his response, although I had hoped for a little more  detail. Given that many groups that tackle rural poverty depend on EU peace  funding for some of their core activities, does the Minister have any plans to  assist those groups in dealing with the reduction in funding from that source?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  It is worrying that there are a number of difficulties. Money from Europe will be about half of what it has been in previous  years, and the future of a number of worthy projects will have to be considered. However, they must be considered by  the Departments taking the respective lead responsibilities; they rank the priority of those projects as  against depart&shy;mental commitments, and I, in turn, when examining  spending allocations, take account of all of the competitive pressures across  all Departments. That is a matter that will be informed both by the Programme for Government and the amounts available to us  through the three-year comprehensive spending review period.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member heard the Deputy First Minister state his and  the First Minister&rsquo;s priority. Poverty must be addressed, and rural poverty is  just as real as urban poverty. If we are to mean anything when we say that we  want devolution to work, we have to make it work for people in that position.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Will the Minister set out the total Northern Ireland resource element  of the departmental expenditure limit for 2006-07, compared to 1998-99, in real terms? What does the Minister expect the  increase to be over the comprehensive spending review period, and how  does he expect the Departments to address their priorities in that period?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  There has been a massive increase in public  spending in Northern Ireland  over those years, and, although we expect to be operating within a tight  fiscal framework, we are still talking about economic growth; that is, economic  growth upon what has been substantial economic growth up until now.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the period to which  the Member refers, the increase has been around 24%. Therefore, much  more money is available to us today than there was in years past, and there has  been, year-on-year, around 1% real growth over the period of the comprehensive  spending review. We are still talking about more being available, but with a  new Assembly and a new Executive in place, there is an ambitious programme,  which can only be curtailed by the amount of spending available to us.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  I was not in the Chamber earlier when the ministerial statement was made, so my  question may have been asked already. Does the Minister agree that rural areas  must be included in any future decentralisation programmes?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I assume that the Member is referring to the decentralisation of public-sector  jobs, particularly in the Northern Ireland Civil Service. Earlier, I said that  the Executive has agreed a review of public-sector jobs, and I will be bringing  the terms of reference to the Committee for Finance and Personnel and to the  Executive so that we can have a robust policy to ensure that there is a fair  spread, taking into account all of the factors, not least of which is the  importance of Belfast as our capital city. However, the need to have a fair  distribution around the country was also mentioned earlier and, as he was not  present, I can tell the Member that a series of bids was made during the course  of the morning, stretching from Larne through to Enniskillen and Omagh.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Review of Rating</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Mr Weir </strong>asked  the Minister of Finance and Personnel to give a timescale within which he  intends to bring proposals to the Executive in relation to the review of  rating.&nbsp; <a name=AQO137/08>(AQO 137/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  The public consultation finished on 31 August, and the consultation report will  be published shortly. That report will be sent to the DFP Committee for it to  scrutinise and, if it wishes, to take further evidence. Following that, I will  bring proposals to the Executive. I hope that that will take place in early  November to allow changes to be made for next April&rsquo;s rates bills. More  fundamental changes cannot be implemented as easily because that would require  primary legislation. In that context, it will take longer to develop firm  proposals. The Executive and the Assembly will wish to examine any long-term  options for change in more detail. Therefore, it may be that all we can decide  on this year is a shortlist of realistic, long-term options for future and  further consideration.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: The  Minister recently indicated that he was considering increasing the savings  limit for pensioners beyond which they are not entitled to certain benefits.  Can the Minister give more detail about that, and could such a proposal be in  place by next April?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  The answer to the latter part of the question is yes. Those types of changes  can be made within the existing legislative framework. I do not wish to  indicate what I believe the outcome of the review of rating should be; I think  that it is important that the Committee for Finance and Personnel have the opportunity to examine the responses that the  Department has received from consultation and give its considered  opinion. I want to be able to take the Committee&rsquo;s opinion into account, as  well as the responses from the consultation, but I can tell the Member, as I  said to a rating conference last week, that the type of proposal that he has  mentioned has attractions and I am sure that the Executive will want to  consider that carefully.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burns</strong>:  Will the Minister confirm that the ability to pay will be a factor in any new  rating scheme?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I can confirm that. There are always difficulties with what might be regarded  as a property tax, and the issue that is most at stake is that of the ability  to pay. In the initial phase of the Depart&shy;ment&rsquo;s consideration, we can only  consider ability to pay in the context of the existing legislation. That means  that we have to consider the types of reliefs that are available and also  issues such as how they affect senior citizens, vacant properties and the issue  of the capping of rates. The ability-to-pay issue is at the heart of the  matter, but it is not easy to fashion that within a capital-based rates system.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McClarty</strong>:  Does the Minister acknowledge that increasing industrial rates from the present  30% would have a significant detrimental  impact on job opportunities, not only in my constituency of East  Londonderry, but in the Minister&rsquo;s constituency of East   Belfast? Is the Minister aware that Northern Ireland manufacturers  already experience the disadvantages of additional gas, electricity and  transport costs?</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, is he also aware that several manu&shy;facturers  have indicated that such an increase would result in the reduction of research  and development budgets and medium-term investment, thus leading to significant  job losses in the private sector that will be difficult to replace?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  The Member will be aware that the Economic Research Institute of Northern  Ireland is carrying out work for the Department on that issue and, therefore, I  should mark time until I receive its report. However, I was sufficiently  indiscreet at a recent Confederation of British Industry conference to indicate that if the focus and centrepiece of  Government policy is economic growth, it would be inconsistent to make  life more difficult for businesses. The Member can extrapolate my view on the  subject from that.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Childcare Voucher Scheme</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mr  McFarland </strong>asked the Minister of Finance and  Personnel to advise on the estimated savings which could result to the Northern Ireland Civil  Service through the implementation of  a childcare voucher scheme, such as that provided by Employers for  Childcare.&nbsp; <a name=AQO210/08>(AQO 210/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  The Northern Ireland Civil Service is committed to introducing a  salary-sacrifice childcare voucher scheme when the new electronic human  resource (e-HR) payroll system is introduced in 2008. Savings to the Northern  Ireland Civil Service will result from a  reduction in employer&rsquo;s National Insurance contributions in proportion  to the salary that staff will be sacrificing in return for childcare vouchers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is difficult to estimate how much will be saved as it  will depend entirely on the number of staff who join the scheme and the value  of the childcare vouchers they choose to take. However, projections based on a  3% uptake by civil servants estimate the total annual savings to be about  &pound;78,000.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McFarland</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer. Does  he acknowledge that the childcare voucher system results in savings for  employers and employees? Will he tell me  why it has taken so long for the Civil Service to offer tax advantages  that employees in progressive companies, such as Bombardier Shorts, currently  enjoy? For the benefit of Northern    Ireland employers and employees, will he  encourage his Executive colleagues to promote childcare voucher systems in  their Departments where appropriate?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I accept that the scheme has great advantages. Incidentally, my Department will  be introducing the scheme throughout the Civil Service, and therefore all of my  colleagues&rsquo; Departments will be included. There have been difficulties in  introducing the scheme, not because of lack of enthusiasm but due to a lack of  manpower.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">To introduce the scheme, the manual input of computer  programmes is required. The programmes are adequate for the scheme, but staff  pay rises, and so forth, were being implemented at the same time, and given the  choices that the Department had to make, the introduction of the childcare  voucher scheme had to be postponed. However, it is only delayed, not cancelled.  The Department intends to proceed with the scheme, which will be of value.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  Will the Minister update the House on any interdepartmental work that has been  carried out to deliver an affordable childcare policy?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  Childcare policy is my responsibility insofar as it applies to the Civil  Service. The scheme, as the Member for North Down Mr McFarland indicated,  benefits individual employees and employers. The Civil Service will want to  take up the scheme and the workforce in all Departments will benefit from that.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Donaldson</strong>:  As the Minister knows, I have corresponded with him on the issue and,  therefore, I understand the reasons for the delay in implementing the scheme.  However, will he confirm his support for the principles behind the childcare  voucher scheme, and will compensation be made available to staff and the  company involved for the delay in implementation?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  The Member is never slow at coming forward on such issues. I support the scheme <span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; ">absolutely and I want it to be up and  running as quickly</span> as possible. As there is no statutory requirement to  introduce the scheme, the question of compensation does not arise. However, the  Department is talking to the company that was going to run the scheme because  it will have incurred some costs due to the withdrawal.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, the scheme is voluntary. The company cannot be  certain whether anyone will take it up, but, obviously,  people will join. We will talk to the company in order to achieve a  sensible outcome.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Workplace 2010</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mr  O&rsquo;Dowd </strong>asked the Minister of Finance and <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; ">Personnel  to outline the time frame for bringing forward</span> the Workplace 2010  strategy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO176/08>(AQO 176/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I am more interested in hearing the Member&rsquo;s supplementary question considering  that he said that I had answered his main  question this morning. As I announced earlier, the Executive approved a  recommendation that Workplace 2010 should proceed <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt; ">to the next stage of procurement. Subject to the injunction</span> that  was imposed as a result of the legal challenge being lifted, I expect an  invitation to submit best and final offers to be issued to the two final  bidders during October 2007. Based on current projections, it is, therefore,  likely that the contract will be awarded by autumn 2008. Workplace 2010 would then be phased in across all  Departments over five to seven years.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. The Minister gave a comprehensive  report this morning during his ministerial statement, so I have been puzzling  over my supplementary question. Will the Minister outline what further role the  Assembly will have in the process? Will there be regular reports to the  Assembly on the contracts, etc?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  In the first instance, I am keen to keep the  Committee for Finance and Personnel informed of issues that arise. I  have promised to meet with the Committee to discuss Workplace 2010 and the job  locations issue, and officials will keep in touch with the Committee about the  terms of reference for such issues. Before the matter is decided, the Committee  will be informed of the up-to-date position, and the Executive will want to see  the contract to ensure that <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt; ">we have the  best possible deal for the people of Northern<span style="letter-spacing:0pt; "> Ireland</span>. I will return to the House with a statement at the  appropriate time.</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McQuillan</strong>:  What will happen at the end of the contracts?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>: The contracts will last for 20 years. I am almost tempted to  say that it will be someone else&rsquo;s problem, but if there is any difficulty, it  will be my problem. We have built a requirement into the draft contract whereby  the estate can be put out for public sale  again if the Department is not satisfied with the new option at the end of 20 years. That will provide a  further safeguard to ensure that public interest is the priority.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading" style="margin-bottom:8.5pt;">Varney Review</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">6. <strong>Mr  Kennedy </strong>asked the Minister of Finance and Personnel to indicate when the  Varney Review of tax policy in Northern    Ireland was likely to bring in its findings;  and what was the scope of the representations he has made to the review. <a name=AQO178/08>(AQO 178/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  On 19 July 2007, the Executive issued their formal response to the Varney  Review&rsquo;s call for evidence. I have no  further insight into Sir David Varney&rsquo;s intentions, but he will present  his final report to the Chancellor of the Exchequer in early October. In the  light of that, I will press for a meeting before the publication of Sir David&rsquo;s  final report.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>: In a recent statement to the Assembly, the Minister stated  that it was premature to call for tax-varying powers, and said that he did not  believe that <span style="letter-spacing:-.25pt; ">the timing was right. In his  responses to the Varney Review</span>, will the Minister confirm whether he may  consider tax-raising powers in the future? Do the Minister and the Department  of Finance and Personnel and, indeed, the Executive have a plan B to put to the  Treasury on other tax-varying measures?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>: Sir David Varney&rsquo;s request to receive evidence resulted in a  report which was unanimously agreed by the Executive with all parties,  including that of the Member, signing up to that submission.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member will not be surprised to hear that back-up  positions are not offered in those types of submissions. We made Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  special circumstances very clear: that we have a land frontier with a state  that has a more competitive corporation tax rate; that we are emerging from years  of conflict and instability; that we need to grow the economy, and that we need  a new instrument to allow us to do that. That case was put forward by the  Executive, and universally by the business community in Northern Ireland and was supported in evidence  that Sir David received in the Republic   of Ireland. At this stage  I do not want to look at any plan B. I am looking to Sir David to do what is  right and to give Northern    Ireland the new fiscal instrument that will  provide it with the step change it needs to get real economic growth.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>:  Does the Minister believe that the Assembly&rsquo;s recent refusal to endorse the  need for tax-varying powers has damaged our case &mdash; if not the process &mdash; for  achieving lower corporation tax in Northern Ireland?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  No. That is not the case, and no reasonable argument can be made to support  that view. During the debate on tax-varying powers, I made it clear that HM  Treasury would probably be happy for us to have them, but that when a calamity  would occur &mdash; as difficulties undoubtedly do happen &mdash; we would be left on our  own to deal with it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We do have a level of tax-varying powers in the regional  rate, which is an instrument that we could use to vary the income we would  require to fulfil spending needs. We will make our submission to Sir David  available so that Members may see it, although it may also be made available at  the foot of his report.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>:  Apart from any recommendations that may come from Sir David Varney, will the  Minister indicate how the Executive can make a difference to our economic  performance?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Molloy] in the Chair)</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  The one concern that I have from all discussions about the Varney Review is  that we foster the belief that the only way  we can better ourselves is through the outcome of that review, and that  unless we get a variation in the rate of corporation tax we will be floundering  where we are at present.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Ultimately, the difference will be in the time we take to  get real economic growth. If we can achieve a step change by getting a proper fiscal instrument that meets the  requirements of Northern Ireland  in the present circumstances, a very  expeditious change in the economic growth and prosperity of Northern Ireland  will be seen. If that instrument is not given, then it will be up to the skill  and ingenuity of the Executive and our officials to put in place whatever  measures are possible. However, that will mean that it will take much longer to  reach the same level of economic growth and prosperity.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Northern    Ireland Audit Office: &nbsp;Earlier Intervention</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">7. <strong>Mr  Dallat </strong>asked the Minister of Finance and Personnel what plans he had for  earlier intervention by the Northern Ireland Audit Office in the financial  affairs of governmental Departments and agencies.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO142/08>(AQO 142/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  Section 65(3) of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 clearly states:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Comptroller and  Auditor General for Northern Ireland  shall not, in the exercise of any of his functions, be subject to the direction  or control of any Minister or Northern    Ireland department or of the Assembly&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, I have no plans &mdash; or authority &mdash; to direct or encourage earlier intervention by the  Comptroller and Auditor General or his staff in the Northern Ireland  Audit Office in the financial affairs of Departments and agencies.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>: I  find the Minister&rsquo;s answer very disappointing. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span> I am glad that he can laugh at these matters. Millions of pounds have gone  missing because there is no system of early intervention. If the Northern  Ireland Audit Office cannot intervene, does the Minister intend to do so and  thus save millions of pounds for the Assembly and prevent embarrassment when the Public Accounts Committee constantly  unravels huge amounts of waste that  could have been prevented?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  The Member should sit down in a dark room and think about what he is asking of  us. He should consider the issue for one moment: the Comptroller and Auditor  General will not want to get involved in a decision &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The time for questions to the Minister of Finance is up.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  The Comptroller and Auditor General will not want to get involved in a decision  that he might have to revisit later.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  That ends questions to the Minister of Finance and Personnel. We move to  questions to the Assembly Commission. I ask Members to take their ease as we go  into questions to the Commission.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading"><a name="10"></a>Assembly Commission</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The next item on the Order Paper is questions to the Assembly  Commission. Mr Paul Butler will answer question 1 and Mr Sean Neeson will  answer question 2 on behalf of the Commission. Question 3 has been withdrawn.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Parliament Buildings: Recycling Levels</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mr McKay </strong>asked the Assembly Commission to give an assessment of the level of  recycling in Parliament Buildings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO177/08> (AQO  177/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Butler</strong>:  Maith th&uacute;. The Commission is keen to promote environmentally friendly  waste-management and energy policies throughout the Assembly. Since 26 June  2006, Parliament Buildings and annexe C have been  involved in an estate-wide recycling initiative to reduce the amount of waste  sent to landfill. Estate maintenance collects waste from the entire estate,  compacts all general waste on site and segregates all recyclable waste for  onward processing. A recycling company has provided us with the receptacles for  segregation, and that is collected daily. The average recycling level in the  estate stands at 30%, and the average recycling level in Parliament Buildings  is between 25% and 30%, which is comparable to Westminster. The Office of the Keeper, in  discussions with estate maintenance and the recycling company, plans to add  more streams to the recycling policy to improve our recycling figures.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly Commission and its staff are developing  excellent links with other Parliaments and assemblies, which will provide a  forum for sharing good practice on  environmental best-practice initiatives.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>:  What energy-efficiency measures are the Commission taking?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Butler</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. The Office of the Keeper works  closely with the energy conservation branch and the Carbon Trust to improve the  efficiency of the Building&rsquo;s lighting and heating. We are introducing  energy-saving bulbs, where feasible, in the Building. Several offices have  powered lighting that turns off when there is no one in the office. Eurest has  adopted the Assembly&rsquo;s recycling policy, and, for example, all its used cooking  oil is collected by the supplier and  recycled. With regard to IT, there is a 60% reduction in the amount of  energy absorbed by the display screens of the new computers, and there is a  reduction in the heat produced by those machines. Printers go into low-power  mode after approximately five minutes of inactivity, and that leads to an 80%  reduction in the power used. Furthermore, the enhanced capabilities of the  printers permit a reduction in the amount of paper used through double-sided  printing and multiple-page presentations. A contract  is in place for recycling all printer consumables from Parliament Buildings  and constituency offices.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. What renewable energy sources are  used for Parliament Buildings?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Butler</strong>:  The Office of the Keeper and the Assembly&rsquo;s recycling policy is something that  we need to consider. I will get back to the  Member with a response.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Parliament Buildings: Artefacts</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr  Dallat </strong>asked the Assembly Commission if it will publish a list of all artefacts in Parliament Buildings,  their value and proposals for their future. <a name=AQO141/08>(AQO  141/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>:  There are approximately 60 items to be considered. A list of the artefacts has  been prepared and will be provided to the Member. Copies can be provided to  other Members on request.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A valuation of the artefacts was undertaken in 2001, and a  further valuation took place in August 2007. The revised figures for that are  not yet at hand, but will be provided to the Member when they become available.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A number of the most well-known artefacts are now being  displayed in rooms in Parliament Buildings, with the remainder securely stored.  The future use of the artefacts has yet to be decided, but it is intended that  the Assembly Commission will consider options for their display in Parliament Buildings in the coming year.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>: I  thank Mr Neeson for his answer.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is a painting, currently hanging in the Speaker&rsquo;s  office, of King William marching towards the Boyne  with Pope Innocent VII hovering overhead, apparently giving his blessing. Does  the Minister agree that having it in a public place to intrigue the visitors  and put another slant on our beleaguered history would be an exciting venture?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>: I am well aware of that particular painting, and, in fact,  during the summer a request was made for it  to go on loan. The pictures that we do have are currently being  displayed in the Members&rsquo; Dining Room, the Speaker&rsquo;s  office and the First Minister&rsquo;s office. Clearly, that is a significant  painting, and where it should be is a consideration for the Commission in the  future.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I understand that there are some artefacts of historical, and probably  military, importance in the courthouse in Newtownards. Has an inventory been  done on those and, if so, what is the intention for them?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>: A  number of artefacts were put into very secure storage after the fire in the  Building, which Members may remember. Over the coming year, the Commission will  be looking at the whole question of the display of artefacts, and consideration  will be given to those that the Member referred to.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Those are all the questions for the Assembly Commission.</p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="11"></a>Private Members&rsquo; Business</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Classroom Assistants</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Debate resumed on amendments to motion:</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly calls upon the Minister of Education to  intervene immediately in the classroom assistants&rsquo; dispute, in recognition of  the vital role of classroom assistants, and to prevent disruption to children&rsquo;s  education. &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Mr B McCrea.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Which amendments were:</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">(1) Leave out all after &ldquo;Education&rdquo; and insert:</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;to implement the recommendations put forward by the trade  unions in the dispute over classroom assistants&rsquo; pay evaluation, and to liaise  with the Minister of Finance and Personnel to ensure that funds are made  available in order to resolve the situation and avert strike action.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Ms Purvis.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">(2) Leave out all after the second &ldquo;assistants&rdquo; and  insert:</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;, by convening an urgent meeting of the Department,  employers and Trade Union side in the dispute, with an agenda to include (a)  retention of the Special Needs Allowance; (b) retention of the 32.5 hourly pay  divisor; (c) NVQ III and the job evaluation exercise; and (d) adequate pay  protection arrangements, in order to prevent disruption to children&rsquo;s  education.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Mr Donaldson.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I am pleased that the Minister has given a clear commitment that she will  intervene personally in that dispute. It is  high time, and she should have done it before, but at least she is doing  it now.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There were only a couple of points that came up in the  debate, because she spent eight minutes attacking everyone else, about everything else, rather than talking about  the issue. The Minister was asked a number of specific questions, and she did  not answer any of them. That is not the way to go forward in this Assembly. For  the Minister to fall out with just about everyone in the Assembly, including  the entire Education Committee save Mr Butler, is not a clever, winning  strategy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The situation facing the classroom assistants is dire. Why should they suffer a cut in pay to finance  financial mismanagement and inappropriate budgeting over a long period  of time? The employers may feel that they have made a generous offer, but that  is not for me to say, despite what the Minister said in her attack on me. Who  is going to fix that problem? There is absolute consensus in the House that we should get the issue sorted.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My colleague Ken Robinson said, and research carried out by the Ulster Unionist Party shows,  that other employers who employ a lot of teaching assistants, as they  are called in England,  say clearly that NVQ 2 is only for beginners and that established, professional  people at the top of the scale should hold NVQ 3 qualifications.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That information comes from Government papers and statistics, and it should have been brought  into play.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">People do not understand the pay cuts. The language that we  hear is that most of the jobs will be OK, and that not all of them will  disappear. However, the people out there are being asked to do more work for  less pay. People say that classroom assistants are wonderful and great, and  that they could not be done without, but that is not the way to reward them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister seemed to suggest that she alone was the only  person doing any work to resolve the dispute. However, when the Committee  questioned her, it discovered that she had held only two meetings with the  relevant parties. Had time permitted, I would have brought to the attention of  the Chairperson of the Committee for  Education that the Committee has brought the matter to the fore at every  available opportunity. However, the Committee has only received research  documents, which have been discussed. We then asked for a statement from the  Minister&rsquo;s Department. Did that turn up? No. Did the Committee have to ask  again? Yes. Eventually, the Committee received some information, but it amounted to nothing. The Department has  taken a hands-off attitude, in case it would dirty itself with that type of  problem. Somebody somewhere will have to take control of the situation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Earlier, we thought that we might get a result. There were faxes going around to that effect. I have a  statement from UNISON. I know that the Minister does not think that we  speak to the unions, but today &mdash; one hour ago &mdash; a statement from UNISON stated  that:</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;We have been formally advised by the employers that no  meeting will be convened today&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We thought that there was going to be a meeting. We were  also advised that:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;No offer will be made. This is on foot of the  attached from&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The statement goes on  to name a permanent secretary.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee talked to  UNISON and to the Northern Ireland Public Service Alliance (NIPSA). It  has been to the meetings in Ballynahinch. People come and talk to the Committee, and the Committee has tried to  under&shy;stand and resolve the problem at every single juncture. It is not  acceptable for the situation to continue for 12 years, and that is the way that  it is going.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Many Members have contributed to the debate. I am mindful  of the positive contributions made by my friend Mr Donaldson in tabling his  amendment, which we will support. There should be some way to give a bit of  direction. We are not trying to be prescriptive. If there are other avenues,  fair enough. We are not trying to constrain anybody&rsquo;s way forward.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have explained the situation to Ms Purvis. I readily  acknowledge that she has been at the forefront of the debate &mdash; I have been told  so by the unions and the classroom assistants. However, although she spoke most  eloquently, it is not right or proper that we should dictate a settlement; that  is for others to do. Although I applaud the stance that she has taken &mdash; and I  under&shy;stand that it is personal, and she has my full support for that &mdash; I regret that I cannot support her  amendment.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Purvis</strong>: I  thank the Member for giving way. Does he accept that his motion was somewhat  weak in its substance, and therefore he has to support something stronger? Does  the Member also accept that, although he does not want to be prescriptive on  the issues relating to a deal, almost every Member in the Chamber has referred  to NVQ level 3, the hourly pay divisor, and the unfair pay? While the Member  does not want to be prescriptive on a deal, those are the issues that he has  addressed during the debate.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I will reiterate for the Member that I was most impressed by her eloquence and  her point about us caring about the outcome and solving it. I agreed with all  of those sentiments. However, as I made clear in the Chamber and outside, I do  not think that her amendment would help, although that is only a difference of  opinion.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to achieve unanimity. That is why I will accept the  amendment tabled by Jeffrey Donaldson and Michelle McIlveen. I want Members to  come together to assist the Minister of Education to resolve the issue. That is  what this debate is about.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister may feel that Members were making unwarranted attacks on her. She made accusations  about gender and Irish-language bias. I am surprised that the Minister  feels that she needs special attention. Every Member is equal and trying to do  a job. Our job is to hold her to account. Her job is to sort this problem out.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members have tried to  be as constructive as possible. What we really want is action. We have  deliberately not said that one side is better than the other. Ms Purvis stated  that I could have been stronger. The trouble is that being stronger does not  necessarily achieve consensus or a way forward. I plead with the Minister to  stop talking about irrelevant matters such as Irish-medium schools and academic  selection &mdash; tackle the issue at hand. Those issues are important and should be  discussed, but there is another, more pressing, issue that must be dealt with  now &mdash; the issue of classroom assistants.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If Members do not take action, we will face a strike on  Wednesday. There will be a rally, which is unlikely to fix the problem, and  that will result in another three days of strikes, which will not fix it  either. The next strike will be for a week &mdash; or forever. That is not the way to  solve the problem. There must be a better way.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister confers with Paul Butler, but Members should  be working together. The UUP motion is an attempt to bring all parties  together. The general consensus in the Chamber is that all Members want  classroom assistants to be looked after properly and fairly. Members are not  pointing the finger of blame &mdash; we just want the problem sorted out.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It may sound strange, but Members understand that the  Department of Education works within constraints. However, the Minister must realise that the Department &mdash; and  only the Department &mdash; has the resources to resolve this. If she must put other  questions to other people, let her come back and talk to the Education  Committee after she has done so. Although it is for the Chairperson to say, I  believe that she will find the Committee to be most accommodating.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I want the Chamber to unite to defeat, regrettably, Ms  Purvis&rsquo;s amendment and give 100% support to the motion as amended by Jeffrey  Donaldson and Michelle McIlveen.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><span class="Italic">Question</span>, That amendment No 1 be  made, <span class="Italic">put and negatived</span>.</p>

The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes to propose and  10 minutes for the winding-up speech. All other Members will have five minutes  to speak.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>: I  beg to move</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly expresses support for world Alzheimer&rsquo;s  day on 21 September 2007; acknowledges that over 15,000 local people are  currently living with Alzheimer&rsquo;s, and that dementia is expected to rise by 27%  over the next ten years, due to people living longer, which would result in  20,500 people in Northern Ireland living with dementia by 2017; and notes that  maintaining current levels of service provision is not sufficient for such an  increase, and that it is important for patients and their carers to receive the  best care available and access to clinically effective drugs, when appropriate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">All around the world, Alzheimer&rsquo;s associations,  individuals, people with dementia and carers came together on Friday 21  September to mark world Alzheimer&rsquo;s day, 2007. It is fitting that the Assembly  acknowledges the attempts that are being made to raise awareness of an illness  that affects millions of people.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The theme of this year&rsquo;s world Alzheimer&rsquo;s day was &ldquo;No time  to lose&rdquo;. I hope that the Assembly will express its support by agreeing with me  that there is no time to lose in addressing this major health challenge.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease and dementia are such a challenge for  us, as so many people are unaware of these serious illnesses or properly  understand them. More must be done to promote awareness so that people  recognise the first symptoms of dementia and seek early help. In turn,  communities must be educated so that they can understand and accept people who  suffer from dementia.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am alarmed by recent figures published by the Alzheimer&rsquo;s  Society that show that more than 15,000 people are already affected by  Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease in Northern    Ireland. Furthermore, the prevalence of  dementia is expected to rise by 27% over the next 10 years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">No doubt the number of people affected by the illness is  significantly higher when one considers its effect on partners, carers and  family members as they struggle to meet the daily challenges of caring for someone with the disease. However, the figures  demand more attention for the illness and better care for people  suffering from dementia in our communities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, the statistics do not tell the whole story. They  cannot convey the breakdown of relationships between relatives who care for a  loved one or how that can result in the loss of a lifelong friend. I have met  representatives of the Alzheimer&rsquo;s Society in Northern Ireland several times, who  tell me that that is the case. The society provides a range of services and is  committed, at all times, to promoting the autonomy and self-determination of  people with dementia.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">People who suffer from dementia and their carers need proper medical attention and care. The  Alzheimer&rsquo;s Society&rsquo;s recent report  from Dementia UK  recommends the development and support of a whole range of services for  people with dementia that responds to their specific care needs. Those services  range from informal home care, day care and social care to specialist,  residential and palliative care. It is clear that the capacity of health and  social care services to meet the multiple needs of people with dementia and  their families is a key policy issue for Northern Ireland. With demand for  services growing, the issue is becoming ever more pressing.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Caring for people with dementia affects the quality of life  of carers considerably. Many carers spend more than 10 hours a day caring for a  person with dementia, so it is important that the Assembly recognises the  burden on them and supports the development of adequate respite services.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The availability of adequate care services for people with  dementia and of carer support poses a challenge. Many carers are unaware of  services, or they feel that services are not available to them when and where  they need them. There are also inequalities of access to treatment for  Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members may be aware  that the Alzheimer&rsquo;s Society took part in the first ever judicial review  of guidance issued through the National Institute for Health and Clinical  Excellence (NICE).</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That challenge related to the guidance on the availability of Alzheimer&rsquo;s drugs on the Health  Service. That landmark High Court  decision ordered the National Institute for Health and Clinical  Excellence to review and rewrite guidelines on access to Alzheimer&rsquo;s drugs. The  court has ruled that the guidance is discriminatory, and therefore, must be  reconsidered. However, the ruling upheld the guidance restricting Health  Service availability of the only licensed drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer&rsquo;s  disease in its very early stages. NICE accepts the clinical effectiveness of  the drugs in question, which cost &pound;2&middot;50 a day. That acceptance of the  effectiveness of those drugs is important.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The decision is now the  responsibility of the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety. I urge the Minister to ensure that everyone, at any stage of  Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, has access to appropriate drugs when those drugs are  clinically recommended &mdash; it is, however, clear that they are not recommended  for everyone.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate that the Department and the Minister have to  manage finite resources and choose priorities carefully. I believe that  Alzheimer&rsquo;s patients and their carers are a priority. The Minister and the  Department must look for savings &mdash; perhaps that could be done through the  prescription of generic drugs, and making more appropriate use of acute  hospital beds, among other savings. I appreciate that any extra cost is a cost  to the taxpayer. However, it is important to realise that we are talking about  a quality-of-life treatment for the patient, which reduces the burden  experienced by carers and, therefore, reduces the cost to the taxpayer.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the immediate future, the potential impact that dementia  will have on the Health Service and on the quality of life in Northern Ireland  is of serious concern. It is crucial that the Department gives dementia the  priority it requires now &mdash; before the demand for services significantly  increases. What is required is greater awareness and de-stigmatisation of dementia;  the building of effective partnerships among policy-makers, clinicians,  researchers, carers and people with dementia; and the development of care  services that are responsive to the needs of people with dementia and their  families.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Policy-makers need to be engaged in order to provide  adequate resources for care and research, now and for the future. Care staff  need to be trained, and the skills of healthcare professionals further  developed to diagnose and manage dementia, as well as promoting research into  developing better treatments for the future.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is clear that the Department of Health, Social Services  and Public Safety must develop plans to adequately respond to the challenges  posed by the growing number of people with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease and dementia.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  I support the motion, which concerns yet another health issue for the House to  consider. I also welcome the Minister&rsquo;s presence.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Alzheimer&rsquo;s and other forms of dementia are devastating  conditions that can take away people&rsquo;s capacity to remember; to make decisions  and choices; to take responsibility; to communicate, and to under&shy;take daily  living activities including personal care, eating, and mobility, all of which  leave the patient totally dependent on others for help.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Because people are living longer &mdash; and statistics reveal an  expected increase of 27% of dementia patients over the next 10 years &mdash; it is  inevitable that action must be taken to make provision for both patient and  carers in order to ensure that they receive the best possible available care  and clinically effective drugs in future months and years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Over the past number of decades, a lack of attention from  policy-makers and service-commissioners to the needs of people with dementia  has led to treatment for dementia being delivered in a piecemeal and  inefficient manner. Therefore, more investment, accompanied by careful  planning, and a focus on quality outcomes for dementia patients will be  required in future years in order to deliver a better quality of life for  patients and their families in a more efficient manner, while using available  resources.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Improved home care support packages, including low-level  support, are required to help patients retain independence and dignity. The  Bamford Review of Mental Health and Learning Disability (Northern Ireland)  highlights the value of early diagnosis and intervention, yet access to home  care support is increasingly restricted to those with the highest levels of  need, making it even more difficult for people not assessed as having substantial  or critical levels of need to access those services.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Unless community support improves, the situation will be  compounded as the population ages and the number of people with dementia  increases. People with dementia can only remain at home with their family and  friends if the right support is put in place. Family and friends who provide  care must have guaranteed access to carer support of a quality and frequency  that meets their needs. It should include practical support services, carer  information, training and access to support groups, as well as emergency  back-up support and quality respite care.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Having watched a loved-one deteriorate from the dreaded  Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, I know something of the stress, anxiety and burden that is  placed on the family unit as it devotes itself to caring for that loved one. A  recent report from the Alzheimer&rsquo;s Society includes the following quotation  from a son caring for a father with dementia, which highlights the family&rsquo;s  anxiety and the gap which exists within current care provision:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think anyone really understands how  exhausting and distressing it is to care for the person you love most in the  world as they deteriorate before your very eyes. Our family wants to continue  to care for my father at home for as long as possible &mdash; but we really do need  more help &mdash; reliable and well-trained people who understand dementia and have  the time to develop a real relationship with my father.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The real challenge now, aside from providing quality care  and care homes, is to support people with dementia in their own homes. More  effort is required from the public, private and voluntary sectors to find good  quality, cost-effective options to meet the needs of patients with dementia and  their families in the years to come.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go raibh maith, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Sinn F&eacute;in supports  world Alzheimer&rsquo;s day, and I welcome the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease is the most common form of dementia and  accounts for 62% of the population with dementia. As has been stated, there are  possibly 16,000 people with dementia living in the North; and it is estimated  that by 2051 that number will have increased to more than 47,000. Dementia  largely affects people over 65, though 2% of sufferers are under 65.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I had a very good friend who died at the age of 48 from  Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. It took two years to diagnose his condition, and it is  possible that, had the disease been diagnosed at a much earlier stage, his life  could have been prolonged and its quality improved. Unfortunately, that did not  happen.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are almost 10,000 people in the North with  Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. Some 5,500 of them are in the early stage of the illness  and 3,200 are in the moderate stage. The statistic that over 1,400 people  develop Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease every year is frightening. Part of their problem is  that it can be difficult to obtain a diagnosis. Only 40% of those with  early-stage Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease are  diagnosed as having the disease and can, therefore, be prescribed drug  treatments.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease is more common in women than in men,  even though women generally live longer. Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease and other forms of  dementia present as one of the world&rsquo;s most significant emerging health and  social care challenges. Unfortunately, there is lack of awareness about it  among policy-makers, clinicians and the general public.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">People affected by dementia do not seek health services,  and even if they were to do so, health care services tend not to meet their  needs. Dementia is a stigma, and people who suffer from it can be excluded, in  some cases, from residential care.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As has been stated, families are the main carers. The  emerging themes are lack of understanding, and how distressing it is to care  for the person you love most in the world as they deteriorate before your very  eyes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On Friday, I spoke to a man whose wife was diagnosed with  Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease in the past two years. Before she descended into the final  stages of the disease she was able to  articulate how she was affected. It struck me that he said that the person  whom he had married 40 years before no longer existed; the body was there, but  the spirit had gone.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Primary healthcare services play an essential role in the detection, management and prevention of  dementia. The Bamford Review highlights a range of important issues that  need to be addressed urgently. Those should include  access to independent information and advocacy services for people with  dementia and their carers. There must be a focus on early diagnosis,  intervention and treatment and improved access to general health and social  care intervention for people with dementia. However, community care services  are only available to those who have complex needs, in situations in which  carers are under so much stress that they are unable to cope.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Drug treatments for Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease are currently  available on the NHS for all patients who are recommended by clinicians. I have  spoken to carers who say that the drugs can be effective, but not necessarily  in all cases. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE)  recommends withdrawing access through the NHS for people in the early stages of  Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease to the only drug treatments that are licensed and  clinically effective, as they are deemed not to be cost effective by NICE. The  drugs &mdash; Reminyl, Exelon and Aricept &mdash; cost approximately &pound;2.50 per day. In  October 2007, the Minister of Health Social Services and Public Safety, Mr  McGimpsey, will make a decision about whether to keep drugs for Alzheimer&rsquo;s  disease on the NHS.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The provision of nursing and residential homes is also in  need of review. Groups such as the Alzheimer&rsquo;s Society, which is the leading  research charity for people with dementia, their families and their carers,  need all the support and funding available to enable them to carry on their  important and valuable work. Local branches, such as the Newry branch in my  constituency, do valuable and important work. Over the years I have had a close  working relationship with the Newry branch of the Alzheimer&rsquo;s Society, the  members of which deserve all the support and funding available to help them  deal with approximately 584 cases of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease our area. By the year  2021, that number will have increased by an estimated 36%. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I support the motion tabled by Carmel Hanna with pleasure. Only now is this  issue coming to the fore: society is adapting to the fact that we are living  longer, which is good and something that many Members are thankful for.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Society must learn to cope with that change, but for the  individuals concerned, and their families, Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease is a tragedy.  Members must ensure that we support those affected, their carers, healthcare  professionals and voluntary organisations, like the Alzheimer&rsquo;s Society, which  do sterling work.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The sad fact is that there is no cure for this disease.  When looking at how one might help, the conclusion is that the only thing one  can do is to try to ease the suffering. Society must do everything possible  when it comes to drugs, respite or other interventions, and I am sure that the  Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety will address those  matters later.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Many questions of a similar nature will continue to affect  us and are probably part of a bigger problem that will become even bigger in  the future. How will society cope with an aging population which has done its  fair share of work and will require more medical intervention in the later  years of life?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In an associative sense, that reminds me of when I tried to  help people with severe learning disabilities. The same issues must be dealt  with: the need for 24-hour care; the lack of breaks or respite, and the worries  of carers about what will happen when they have passed away.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will not labour that point because I am sure that &mdash; as  with all such issues &mdash; there is general support from Members. In the fullness  of time, and as soon as possible, the Minister must bring forward a strategic  vision for Alzheimer&rsquo;s. There cannot be a quick fix. Long-term investment for the future must be examined. Members  must take a long, hard look at that because the level of expenditure that is  required is one that the Assembly is not used to having to deal with. There is  no point in simply saying that the matter must be dealt with: money needs to be  found in order to do that. That is what civilised people do. The Assembly must  box clever in order to provide respite to the people who need it, and to be  able to afford appropriate drugs.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly can be assured of my party&rsquo;s support for the motion. I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s  comments.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Deeny</strong>:  Having listened to other Members&rsquo; contributions to the debate, perhaps I can  add to it by speaking as someone who has worked with people before their being  diagnosed with Alzheimer&rsquo;s, when they were fit and healthy, and, indeed, when  they have reached the end stage of the disease, just prior to death. I am sure  that Members are aware of how devastating the disease is, not only for the  sufferer, but for his or her entire family circle.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to outline some facts about Alzheimer&rsquo;s. It is a  progressive, incurable and physical disease of the brain that results in  ongoing deterioration of brain function. As has been stated, there are many  types of dementia. Dementia simply means a lessening of brain function. The  most common form is Alzheimer&rsquo;s, followed by vascular dementia, which is  circulatory. There are other rarer forms.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Alzheimer&rsquo;s is a progressive disease, which means that,  gradually, more parts of the brain are damaged. As that happens, the symptoms  become more severe and distressing. They involve memory loss, confusion, and  problems with speech and understanding, which progress until sufferers end up  in a baby-like mental state. That is well known. However, it is extremely  disturbing for family members and for those who have to care for Alzheimer&rsquo;s  sufferers. Patients become completely disorientated in time, place and person.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As has been rightly  pointed out, Alzheimer&rsquo;s sufferers are stigmatised, rejected, dismissed,  shunned and ignored. It appals me to see that, but it happens. It is a major  societal problem. Society must change its views to that most distressing  disease. Having worked with people for years in general practice, I believe  that we forget and ignore the older and much wiser generation at our peril.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is no  straightforward test for dementia. Doctors do not know why some people  get Alzheimer&rsquo;s and others do not. It is known to be inherited in 5% to 10% of sufferers. Some statistics from the Alzheimer&rsquo;s  Society have already been mentioned. I wish to recap on some of those:  there are 700,000 sufferers of dementia in the UK, of whom 400,000 have  Alzheimer&rsquo;s; there are 24 million sufferers of dementia worldwide; at present,  as another Member mentioned, 15,000 younger people in the UK suffer from  pre-senile dementia, and there will be more than 1 million sufferers of  dementia in the UK by 2025. The Assembly must, therefore, consider future  health provision.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Two thirds of dementia sufferers are women. The proportion  of dementia sufferers doubles in every five-year age group: in other words,  there are twice as many dementia sufferers among 70- to 75-year-olds as there  are among 65- to 70-year-olds. It is estimated that delaying the onset of  dementia by five years would reduce the number of deaths that are directly attributable to the disease by 30,000 a year. The  financial cost of dementia in the UK is more than &pound;17 billion each  year. Some 64% of people who live in care homes suffer from a form of dementia.  Two thirds of people who suffer from dementia live in the community and one  third live in care homes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As my colleague Basil McCrea mentioned, there is no cure  for that dreadful disease. Therefore, the basis of treatment is to alleviate,  as far as possible, some or all of the symptoms of the disease and to slow down  its progression.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Some drugs, such as Aricept, Exelon and Reminyl, can do  that. Of course, there is major controversy at the moment about Ebixa, which is  said not to be clinically effective. That is why the National Institute for  Health and Clinical Excellence has said that it should not be prescribed. However, if it is, subsequently, proven  to be clinically effective, then it should be prescribed. That is my view, as a  medical person.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is believed that  eating a healthy diet which includes omega-3 fatty acids, which are  found in oily fish such as salmon and mackerel, and staying physically and  mentally active are very important. Also, recreational activities that promote  conversation and mental stimulation are very important in helping to prevent  dementia, or at least in delaying its onset. It has also been proven that those  activities can help to improve life for those who already have the disease.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">World Alzheimer&rsquo;s day &mdash; held on 21 September each year &mdash;  promotes awareness of the disease so that people can understand its early  symptoms; provides support and accessible information to sufferers and their  carers; trains staff and develops the skills of healthcare professionals;  engages policy-makers to provide adequate resources; promotes research; and  educates communities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In my view, having been a doctor for 27 years, Alzheimer&rsquo;s  disease, and dementia in general, presents one of the greatest health and  social challenges of our time which, across the world, often goes unnoticed. We  all need to play our part in improving the quality of life of all those who are  unfortunate enough to suffer from dementia, and that of their families and  carers. I support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>: I am pleased to join with other Members to encourage the Assembly  to express support for world Alzheimer&rsquo;s day, which was acknowledged across the  world last Friday. An increasing number of people are suffering from dementia  and Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. I can see the significance of that as regards its  impact on services and care provision, and the need for increased expenditure  on appropriate drugs.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Resources are finite,  and healthcare provision cannot command unlimited support. There are  challenges to be faced by the Assembly as  we consider the distribution of available resources. Those challenges  will require all of us to have more realistic expectations and an understanding  of the need to establish priorities. We must all recognise that dementia and  Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease are conditions that can knock on any door. They are among  the greatest challenges to be faced by health professionals, and communities,  in the century that lies ahead.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">These illnesses are often hidden from the public gaze,  unnoticed, stigmatised, often dealt with by family members and carers who make  the best of a very difficult situation &mdash; often with little help. They are  increasing in frequency, with an estimated 24 million sufferers worldwide &mdash;  though that statistic may only be the tip of the iceberg when compared to the  real situation. It is incumbent on all of us to challenge the myths, remove the  stigma and support the carers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We can all contribute to improving the situation. It is  clear that additional resources must be matched by specific actions. There is  much that we can do to promote awareness, as we are doing by using the Assembly  to educate the public about dementia and Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. We need, in our  health provision, to provide accessible information and support for carers and  health staff. Training and education programmes for carers and health  professionals will equip people with diagnostic skills so that treatment can be  made available at an early stage of the disease.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Policy-makers must be encouraged to see the need for  increased resources for care and research. Research is vital in helping us to  understand the problem and give effective treatment. The education of the wider  community is also a challenge that we can meet. We must encourage everyone to  empathise with those who are ill and  recognise the burden placed on their families.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that Members are keen to send a strong message of  support from the Assembly to the 35,000 people in Northern Ireland who are directly  affected by such illnesses, and to give an assurance to all those involved in  caring for them that we understand their situation and will encourage the  provision of appropriate support. I support the motion. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I support the motion, and I thank  Carmel Hanna and Tommy Gallagher for proposing it. Alex Easton mentioned 35,000  people &mdash; multiply that figure by three to give a conservative estimate of the  number of people who are affected by Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease and other forms of  dementia.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As a society, we are living longer and, therefore, we need  to consider &mdash; as other Members have said &mdash; the impact of that on the Health  Service. The costs need to be built into future budgets. Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease  and other forms of dementia are devastating conditions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">They take away someone&rsquo;s capacity to remember, to make  decisions and choices, take responsibility, communicate and do the everyday  things that we take for granted. It is a  devastating condition. The Alzheimer&rsquo;s Society sent me some information,  and I will read out some comments from a woman who has recently been diagnosed  at age 62. She says:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The medication I take seems to be stopping me from  getting worse at the moment. But I know that won&rsquo;t last forever &mdash; and I am so,  so frightened. I live on my own; I have no relatives close by. What am I  supposed to do, who am I going to be able to trust to keep me safe and help me  lead as full a life as possible. I am just so frightened.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That is the fear that most sufferers have &mdash; that they will  no longer be able to live the life that they lived previously.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I now turn to the implications for future public health  policy in developing countries. We must look at possible means of prevention.  Prevention should focus on targets suggested by current evidence: risk factors  for vascular disease, including hypertension, smoking and type 2 diabetes. It is quite obvious that more research is  needed to look at other risk factors in the developing world, and work in that  area has already started.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must make progress  in dementia care in developing countries. There is a lack of awareness  among policy-makers, clinicians and the general public, and I will outline the  many consequences that that has. People affected by dementia do not seek health  services &mdash; even if they do, healthcare services tend not to meet their needs.  Sufferers are stigmatised, and they can be excluded from residential care. It  is quite evident that there are no co-ordinated lobby groups to provide  information or advice to Governments. Families are the main caregivers, and  they lack support and understanding from others and can experience considerable  strain and isolation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Carmel Hanna and others mentioned the Bamford Review. The  Bamford Review report on older people, mental health, and dementia, &lsquo;Living  Fuller Lives&rsquo;, has not yet been costed, prioritised or implemented. We need to  include access to independent information and advocacy services for people with  dementia and their carers. We need to focus on earlier diagnosis, intervention  and treatment, and we must look at improved access to general health and social  care interventions for people with dementia.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Kieran Deeny and my colleague Micky Brady mentioned drug  treatments for Alzheimer&rsquo;s that are currently available on the national health  service. NICE recommends withdrawing from the NHS the only effective licensed  clinical drug treatments for people with early stages of Alzheimer&rsquo;s. NICE has  deemed that those drugs are not cost-effective. Kieran mentioned Exelon and  Aricept, and they cost &pound;2&middot;50 a day. That matter will be considered by the  Department of Health, Social Services and the Public Safety, the Minister and,  I hope, the Committee, and a decision will be made sometime in October. We must  look at that matter, too. If drugs are effective, they must be prescribed to  people, as Kieran has said. If they are not effective, an effective alternative  must be found. It is quite clear that people suffering from Alzheimer&rsquo;s and  other forms of dementia are already excluded and stigmatised, and we must  ensure that we do all that we can for them. It is with pleasure that I support  the motion, which seems to have cross-party support. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  I am sure that the present Minister of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety &mdash; who I am glad to see in the House  today &mdash; and his successors will be keenly aware of the changing health  priorities that increasing longevity brings. Although the motion gives a large  projected number of future sufferers of Alzheimer&rsquo;s,  the requirements for services and effective medication will, I am sure,  be kept under review by the Department.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Changing demographics  require that all public services need to be adaptable and proactive in  planning for future requirements. It is also essential that the contribution  that family members make in caring for those with Alzheimer&rsquo;s is not  underestimated.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Health Service saves a huge amount of capital  expenditure on finding nursing beds or other suitable accommodation because  many families keep their loved ones at home. Every Member will be happy to  recognise and applaud the contribution of those families, who take such great  care of their loved ones. Too often, the dedication and sacrifice of carers  goes unnoticed and unrecognised by society in general, and everyone should  remember that Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, or any other form of dementia, affects the  family circle and not just the individual.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is hard to understand fully the dedication required of  people caring for relatives with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, as they watch their loved  ones become a shadow of their former selves. That only adds to the burden of  care and is why provision for and access to the support services available for  carers must be maintained. It is also why the best clinical treatments should  be under constant review to ensure that quality of life for sufferers and  carers is kept at the highest and best possible level.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am more than happy to express my support for world  Alzheimer&rsquo;s day and will certainly keep an interest in the provision of  services and effective medication for sufferers. I support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I add my support to the motion and thank those who proposed it. I am not a  member of any health committee nor do I pretend to be an expert on health  matters, least of all on Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. In many ways, this is a personal  statement, as I am a member of a family that recently lost a loved one to the  disease. It has created enormously difficult family circumstances, as, over a  six-year period, we have had to come to terms with each of the very trying,  and, in many ways, cruel stages of the condition.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The disease began six years ago with ordinary, simple  mistakes, such as overlooking minor matters, and as time wore on, those  apparently simple mistakes multiplied and were amplified to the extent that we  were able to identify the cause of something that had wrought enormous change  in one whom we loved so deeply. It led a once very capable, cheerful,  efficient, pleasant and outgoing person to retreat almost into a shell, which  was enormously difficult for the family to come to terms with. A concerned and  loving husband, children, grandchildren and the wider family circle knew that  something was not right and that certain things were happening.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Medical help was, of course, made available but was always  going to be limited, not least because there is no cure. There may even be  issues in the medical profession about the condition. It is important that the  medical profession does not write off people who suffer from Alzheimer&rsquo;s  disease; finding that balance in the medical profession can sometimes be  difficult. Medication is available but not always successful.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Care is available, and, like Mickey Brady, I pay tribute to  the Newry branch of the Alzheimer&rsquo;s Society, which gave my family all the help  and support that it could. However, as the years passed, it became inevitable  that we as a family could no longer provide adequate nursing care for our loved  one, and we were then so grateful to Avila  nursing home in Bessbrook for taking on that care, attention and love, which  was quite exceptional.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">5.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, that did not completely dispel the feelings of guilt or inadequacy that we, as a family,  felt. Although the nursing care was excellent, we somehow felt that we  were letting our relative down.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Alzheimer&rsquo;s is an illness that has not been treated with  proper respect or recognition, largely because of ignorance. It has been a  topic for rather poorly judged jokes, but there is nothing funny about  Alzheimer&rsquo;s &mdash; ask any family that has been  through it with a relative. I hope  that, through debates of this nature, we can improve and increase the  public understanding of the illness.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Our loved one passed away peacefully on 10 May, and we were  gratified and comforted by the fact that she had strong personal faith. Her  passing came in the middle of so-called huge, important political events, which  were a reminder that there are some events over which we have little or no control. I support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>: My contribution comes after a graphic account of another  Member&rsquo;s personal experience. Mr Kennedy&rsquo;s speech has sent Members a clear  message that our Health Service has a long  way to go to meet its response to the  needs of people with Alzheimer&rsquo;s.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Every year, there is a rise in the number of people who are  identified as sufferers. With that increase, a growing number of families is  brought into the net, and must face the challenges and responsibilities of  caring for family members. Most of my comments will be directed towards carers,  because families in my constituency of Fermanagh and South Tyrone do not  understand the reason for the local health trust&rsquo;s many shortcomings. The carers  have huge demands placed on their time and on their health. They pay a price  with their well-being, yet they still save the Government millions of pounds  every year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are ongoing serious problems with the level of  support that is available to carers. The Western Health and Social Care Trust  cannot meet the need of Alzheimer&rsquo;s patients because of budget constraints.  Moreover, its care budget is in deficit. Some care packages are being cut, and  the vulnerable people to whom the motion refers are being asked to use their  pensions and benefits to pay for care packages.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Every week, my  constituency office receives enquiries from families who are trying to  cope with someone who has dementia. I am sure that other Members have the same experience. Those families are always  distressed, particularly over the lack of support that they receive.  Instead of being given support, they face cutbacks.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is completely wrong that someone who is caring for a  family member who has Alzheimer&rsquo;s should also have to fight a battle against  cuts in their care package. I do not understand the situation. The families  find it unsatisfactory and certainly do not understand the situation. In some  areas of the west, facilities such as residential care, day care and respite  care are either scarce or non-existent. Those areas must be examined urgently  and further developed. There are often not enough places in those care homes  that have the appropriate skills and facilities to deal with people who have  Alzheimer&rsquo;s.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The assessment, around the time of the onset of the  illness, should be based on need. My experience is that the assessment is based  more on how much money is available in the budget than on the needs of patients  &mdash; and I am afraid that that is increasingly the case. I am aware of several  cases in which basic needs are not being met because of lack of money, and I  referred to the extra stress that that puts on those involved with the  patients, particularly those who cannot access respite care.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">People suffering from Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease can sometimes  deteriorate quickly, and that can result in major changes in their overall  circumstances. When that happens, the Health Service is slow in providing the  extra support needed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As anyone in the west will know, the area has a poor occupational therapy service and suffers from a  shortage of occupational therapists. Money is available for home  adaptations and the provision of facilities in the home. However, although the  money is available, an occupational therapist is not always available to come  to the person&rsquo;s home to carry out the assessment.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  This bes a topic fowk hae strang feelins aboot an hit&rsquo;s yin A hae spoke aboot  monie tims afore es the figures ir vexin&rsquo; an&rsquo; far reachin&rsquo;.

	      <p class="B3BodyText">Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease is an emotive subject on which I have  spoken many times, because the statistics are worrying and far-reaching. I do  not need to talk about the number of sufferers that the disease has affected,  and will affect, in Northern    Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, I am at pains to emphasise that the onset of  severe dementia can be deferred for years by drug treatment. That sounds  positive, but, as ever, life is not that simple. The National Institute for  Health and Clinical Excellence recommendations mean that in England and Wales,  the provision of the drugs that can provide a better quality of life to  early-stage sufferers of the disease, at a cost of &pound;2&middot;50 a day, is no longer an  option for the NHS.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, it is the Minister of Health, Social Services and  Public Safety who will be making the decision in Northern Ireland, and I take this  opportunity to ask him to think long and hard about those drugs and whether he  will blindly follow the mainland&rsquo;s lead.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I was greatly moved by Danny Kennedy&rsquo;s speech. His passion and compassion sums up for every  Member how the disease affects people. Several people have come into my  advice centre, and I remember some who were in the early stages of Alzheimer&rsquo;s  disease and who have now passed away.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For a relatively small amount of money, drugs can, and do,  make a positive difference to the lives of sufferers and carers. They enable  sufferers to remain independent, which decreases the burden of cost for the  state, as they are able to stay at home and be cared for by loved ones for  longer. That reduces their reliance on the state for care provision.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The number of dementia sufferers is increasing, and it is  projected that there will be a 200% increase by 2050. Members will not be here then, but that projection  indicates the extent of the problem and how much it will grow. It does not take  a mathematician to work out that the state cannot afford the &pound;40,000 per annum  needed to care for each person suffering from severe dementia.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It would be better to ensure that the development of the  late stages of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease is delayed for as long as possible, which is  what the motion is all about. It is about providing drugs to the sufferers,  delaying the onset of dementia and giving families confidence and support when  they need it. To deny people in the early stages of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease the  only clinically-effective licensed drugs for their condition is cruel and unfair. Moreover, we must always remember  the carers and families who, unashamedly, and without pay or financial  assistance, care for their loved ones. They are the mainstay of dementia care  in Northern Ireland. I ask Members to support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I do not pretend to be a statistician; however, the  following figures have a purpose. A Dementia UK report states that people  caring for dementia sufferers save the public purse over &pound;6 billion a year,  &pound;141 million of which is attributable to Northern Ireland.  I urge the Minister to look to the future and allow effective drugs to  be used where appropriate, helping not only the dementia sufferers, but their  families, so that the sufferers can have a few more years of freedom,  independence and some semblance of normal life. I support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McFarland</strong>:  Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease is one of the most disturbing diseases. To watch a loved  one progressively become a total, and sometimes hostile, stranger is devastating. My father suffered from  vascular dementia after a series of strokes. The effect is similar to  Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, and my mother cared for him for 10 years before his death. The effect of the demolition  process is profound on both sufferer and carer.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is encouraging that  the issue of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease is now to the forefront. I commend the  Alzheimer&rsquo;s Society for its efforts in  supporting sufferers and carers. For the record, I commend to the  Minister nine recommendations made in a recent 2007 Dementia UK report to  the Alzheimer&rsquo;s Society.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Dementia must be made a publicly stated health and social  care priority. That must be reflected in plans &mdash; something unusual in Northern Ireland  &mdash; for service development and public spending.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There must be an urgent review of Northern Ireland  medical research funding to establish current levels of dementia-focused  research. An ambitious funding programme into the causes, prevention, cure and  care of dementia sufferers must also be developed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Dementia carer training should be a made a core, and  substantial, part of the training curriculum for nurses and social care staff. Standards must be developed in Northern Ireland  to include dementia-specific requirements on dementia-care training.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">People with dementia need improved home-care support  packages, including low-level support to retain their independence and dignity.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Families and friends who provide care must have guaranteed  access to carer support of a quality and frequency that meets carer needs. That  must include practical support services, carer information, advocacy, training  and access to support groups, as well as emergency backup and support and  quality respite care for dementia sufferers and their carers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must have Government-backed debate on who pays for care  to establish a clear and fair balance between the contributions made by the  state and by the individual. We will not get into that debate today, but it  would be helpful if the Minister were to address the issue with the Committee  for Health, Social Services and Public Safety.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">5.00 pm<span style="font-style:normal; "> </span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">An integrated, comprehensive range of care models for  dementia sufferers could be developed to bridge the gap between care at home  and care in the care home. Dementia sufferers and their carers need guaranteed  access to specialised health, social care and support services.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, Northern    Ireland politicians must ensure that  dementia sufferers continue to benefit from clinically-effective drugs on the  NHS.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That is from a recent academic study, given to the  Alzheimer&rsquo;s Society. Those recommendations make sense to me. I commend them to  the Minister, and I commend the motion to the House.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: I, like all Members in the Chamber, am concerned  about meeting the needs of those suffering from Alzheimer&rsquo;s &mdash; and other forms  of dementia &mdash; and of their carers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have already stated my commitment to improving the  services for people with mental-health problems or learning disabilities,  regardless of age. Alzheimer&rsquo;s, and other forms of dementia, seriously impact  upon the lives of the families and carers of sufferers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">All Members will be aware of the Bamford Review, which is  central in providing us with a future strategy for mental-health and  learning-disability services in Northern    Ireland. The Bamford Review highlights that  16,000 people aged over 65 currently suffer from dementia in Northern Ireland.  In 20 years that figure will have increased to 20,500, and by 2051 to 47,000,  which represent increases of 30% and 200% respectively.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Dementia is essentially a disease of the elderly; 10% of  people over 75 suffer from dementia, a rate which doubles every five years of  increasing age, so that over 40% of people over the age of 85 are likely to be  affected. There are also approximately two women for every man affected, which  is due to the longer life expectancy of women.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although dementia is predominantly a disease of the older  generation, it can also affect younger people. The Bamford Review reveals that  dementia in younger people is a significant problem, with an estimated 500  people affected &mdash; although the true figure could be much higher. Early-onset  dementia is particularly common in people with Down&rsquo;s syndrome; 40% of those  aged 50 with Down&rsquo;s syndrome have signs of dementia. There is no one cause for  the early onset of dementia, although research shows that alcohol-related brain  damage accounts for 10% of the overall dementia population and 12&middot;5% of dementia  in people under 65.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease is the most widely recognised form of  dementia. The Alzheimer&rsquo;s Society estimates that, of the 16,000 dementia  sufferers in Northern    Ireland, 10,000 have Alzheimer&rsquo;s. It is a  disease that is likely to have existed for a long time, but in the past it was  simply accepted that people got confused and forgetful as they got older.  Increasing recognition, and increasing lifespan of the population are probably  the reasons why Alzheimer&rsquo;s is now more prevalent. However, the possibility  that modern lifestyles and toxins could be making this disorder more widespread  cannot be ruled out.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Researchers believe  that for the majority of sufferers, Alzheimer&rsquo;s  disease is due to a combination of different risk factors rather than a  single cause. Such factors, which vary from person to person, may include age,  genetic predisposition and other diseases or environ&shy;mental agents. Alcohol can  contribute to the onset of dementia, and smoking is now recognised as a  possible contributory factor of the  disease. It is not unreasonable to suggest that modern lifestyle may be  having an impact on the growth of dementia.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Dementia is a cynical syndrome, characterised by the  widespread loss of mental functions, such as memory loss, disorientation,  changes in personality, self-neglect and uncharacteristic behaviour. It is also  important to state that Alzheimer&rsquo;s is a progressive disease, for which there  is no cure and from which sufferers will eventually die. Stages of the disease  are often characterised as mild, moderate and severe, which require particular  and appropriate treatments at each stage. That is why we must ensure that  sufferers receive the best help available: services must be tailored towards  the needs of the individual and must not be based on assumptions made about the  disease. Alzheimer&rsquo;s affects each person in an individual way.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Several drugs for treating dementia are available on  prescription in Northern    Ireland. These include drugs to treat  specific symptoms such as depression or aggression,  and anti-dementia drugs, which can improve cognitive function in  patients for a limited time by increasing the availability of neurotransmitters  in the brain. However, they do not work for all patients, and indications are  that they do not slow the progress of specific dementias such as Alzheimer&rsquo;s  disease. Anti-dementia drugs are available on prescription in Northern Ireland,  and treatment is initiated under the recommendation of a consultant. Any  prescriptions can be subsequently repeated and monitored by a GP. Over 44,000  prescriptions are dispensed annually.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety is currently reviewing the NICE  guidance on Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. Several Members mentioned that guidance.  The Department is also reviewing a broader NICE clinical guideline on the  management of dementia. That includes  advice on the use of antipsychotic drugs in treating non-cognitive  symptoms of dementia. Antidepressants are also used to treat associated depressive  symptoms.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">NICE has recommended the use of anti-dementia drugs to  treat people who have moderate Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. The institute is determined  that the drugs can be clinically effective when the disease is at a moderate  stage. NICE make its recommendations, and although the Government &mdash; or I, as  Minister &mdash; will not question its decisions on the clinical effectiveness of a  drug, I will question a drug&rsquo;s application and appropriate use. That is why I  have not considered that matter. However, I will do so this autumn and will  inform the House in due course.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Drugs are not the only  available support for dementia sufferers. There is a unique integrated  system of social care in Northern    Ireland. That means that integrated care  teams can take a holistic approach to assessing and meeting all health and  social care needs. I know that there are differential applications of the  service in Northern Ireland,  but there is a strategy behind that. For instance, the &lsquo;Caring for Carers:  Recognising, Valuing and Supporting the Caring Role&rsquo; report, which was  published in January 2006, is still a work in progress. When treating and  supporting anyone who has dementia, our intent must be to allow those people to  live as independent and fulfilled lives as possible. We intend to make the best  use of their structural advantage by introducing a single care-assessment  process. Work on that is already under way and is being led by a team from the University of Ulster. As well as improving and  harmonising standards of assessment, it will reduce unnecessary duplication for  users and professionals.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We already have some excellent examples of flexible and  responsive community-care services both for people who have dementia and for  their carers. In the Northern Health and  Social Care Trust, for example, the Causeway Hospital  is working in partnership with the Northern Ireland Housing Executive and the  Fold Housing Association. They have developed residential, therapeutic and  support services on a single site. Voluntary groups, such as the Alzheimer&rsquo;s  Society, also have access to those facilities for the delivery of their  services.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In 2007&ndash;08, an additional &pound;4 million was invested in  flexible and responsive community care services for older people, including  those who have dementia. Families living with dementia should also have the  opportunity to avail of direct payments in order that they can exercise choice and independence in assessing the  services that they need. I am not suggesting that everything is perfect or that  we have implemented all recommendations, but a strategy exists, and it is very  much a work in progress.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As part of the Bamford Review, &lsquo;Living Fuller Lives&rsquo;, a  consultation report into mental health and learning disabilities, was  published. That report deals with future services for those who will develop  dementia and/or mental-health issues in later life. The Department is leading  on preparing the Government&rsquo;s response to the Bamford Review and is taking the  recommendations of that report into consideration. Work has already begun on  its implementation. For example, Bamford recommended the establishment of a  policy- and practice-development centre for mental-health services for older  people. Such a centre would provide information, training, consultation and  research and would help to secure comprehensive and relevant dementia-service  provision. In May 2007, a regional dementia services development centre for Northern Ireland  was launched.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The service was funded  for two years by the Atlantic Philanthropies organisation and will be  supported by the team at Stirling   University until March  2009. The purpose was to enhance the standard of care for people with dementia  and their families through education, consultancy, research and development.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I also recently established the Mental Health and Learning  Disability Board, and I expect that board to be a champion for people with  mental-health and learning disabilities and one of the driving forces in  delivering the Bamford reforms. The role of the board is also to advise and  challenge me on the approach and pace of implementation of the recommendations.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am on record as saying that I accept that there is a need to do more to develop mental-health services  for the people of Northern    Ireland. I am committed to building on what is currently in place and to improving  services, in line with the  recommendations in the Bamford Review, for sufferers and carers alike.  That is increasingly important now that more of us are living longer.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  I would keep the House here all night if I commented on everything that Members  have said, but everyone who spoke touched  on the same issue, which makes it plain that people do understand some  of what dementia brings to a family. I nursed my father before he died of  senile dementia, and it is very hard for any  family that has to do that. You watch that family member fading away before  your eyes, becoming a stranger to you as you become a stranger to him,  and you wonder whether there is anything that you can do to stop him from doing some of the things that he does, but  everyone is helpless in that situation. It is very, very difficult to  cope with. I always respect people who care for those with dementia, because  they can never get enough support.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Minister  to the House today and thank him for telling Members about the current  position on treatment and support for sufferers of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, and the  way forward, but I urge him to do every&shy;&shy;thing in his power to relieve the  situation for both the victims of dementia  and, particularly, for the families and loved ones who have to live with  them. I can say for sure, that it is not easy &mdash; it is very, very difficult.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is good that the motion was brought to the House today.  The wording of the information booklet on Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease &lsquo;No Time to Lose&rsquo;  is right &mdash; there is no time to lose when someone develops dementia. There is no  time medically, or for the family, because early intervention is necessary to  stop sufferers from being so badly affected that they do not know their family  members and their family members do not know them. It is very bad for everyone.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">With the help of the Minister, the Assembly is going in the  right direction towards helping those affected by Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Adjourned at 5.28 pm.</p>
