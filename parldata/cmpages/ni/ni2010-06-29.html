<p class="B3BodyTextItalic" align="center" style="text-align:center;">The Assembly  met at 10.30 am (Mr Speaker in the Chair).</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic" align="center" style="text-align:center;">Members  observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
    <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="a"></a>Executive Committee Business</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Forestry Bill: Royal Assent</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="b"></a>Budget (No.3) Bill: Royal Assent</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Before we proceed to today&rsquo;s business, I have a number of announcements to make  to the House. The Forestry Bill and the Budget (No.3) Bill have received Royal  Assent. The Forestry Act (Northern Ireland)  2010 and the Budget (No.3) Act (Northern    Ireland) 2010 became law on 28 June 2010.</p>
    <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="c"></a>Assembly Business</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Committee Chairpersons</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I received the resignation of Mrs Naomi Long as Deputy Chairperson of the  Committee for the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister. The  resignation is effective from Monday 28 June 2010. The nominating officer of  the Alliance Party, Mr David Ford, has nominated Dr Stephen Farry as Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for the Office of the First Minister and deputy  First Minister. Dr Farry has accepted the appointment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also received notification from the nominating officer of  the Democratic Unionist Party, the Rt Hon Peter Robinson, that he has nominated  Mr Jonathan Bell as Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for Employment and  Learning. Mr Bell also has accepted the appointment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am satisfied that all correspondence meets the  requirements of Standing Orders, and I therefore confirm Dr Stephen Farry as  Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for the Office of the First Minister and  deputy First Minister and Mr Jonathan Bell as Deputy Chairperson of the  Committee for Employment and Learning, both with effect from Monday 28 June  2010.</p>
    <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="d"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">DE: Capital Review</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have received notice from the Minister of Education that she wishes to make a  statement.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education (Ms Ruane)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Ar dt&uacute;s  b&aacute;ire, t&aacute; br&oacute;n m&oacute;r orm nach raibh m&eacute; sa Tion&oacute;l D&eacute; M&aacute;irt seo caite.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">First, I thank the Speaker for permitting me this time. I  have already done so in writing, but I would like to apologise formally for  arriving a few minutes late last Tuesday. I therefore extend my apologies and  assure Members that no discourtesy whatsoever was intended. I know that the  Speaker knows that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Is eol do Chomhalta&iacute; gur fh&oacute;gair m&eacute; athbhreithni&uacute; ar gach  tionscadal caipitil scoile a bh&iacute; f&aacute;gtha i bplean sol&aacute;thair infheist&iacute;ochta an  Choiste Feidhmi&uacute;ch&aacute;in i m&iacute; Dheireadh F&oacute;mhair sa bhliain 2009. T&aacute; an  t-athbhreithni&uacute; seo cr&iacute;ochnaithe anois, agus ba mhaith liom an t-eolas is  deireana&iacute; a thabhairt do Chomhalta&iacute; ar thortha&iacute; an athbhreithnithe seo inniu.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members will be aware that, in October 2009, I announced a  review of all school capital projects remaining on the Executive&rsquo;s investment  delivery plan. That review is now complete, and I would like to update Members  on its findings. At the same time, I would like to take the opportunity to  inform Members about the constraints facing me in the light of the cuts that  have been made to the education budget generally and, specifically, to its  capital build aspect.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The objective of the capital review was to validate that  each project in the investment delivery plan is consistent with the policy  framework and will hence be viable and sustainable in the long term. It was  commissioned to ensure that we maximise the impact of the scarce resources that  we have available in the best interests of children and young people. A  detailed analysis of the proposal for each project to validate them against  criteria has been completed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased to say that the majority of schools on the investment  delivery plan are considered sustainable and viable in the long term and would  serve the interests of children and young people well. There are a number of  other schools where there are issues that need further clarification. I did not  want to exclude any school where I believe the issues can be quickly resolved  and where, with a little work, the projects should be ready to move forward.  Finally, I have concluded that a number of school projects cannot be taken  forward as currently proposed. More work on those needs to be done by the  school managing authorities, particularly in reflecting a more strategic  approach to planning provision.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to work with the schools and school managing  authorities to address the issues that have emerged from the review and to  bring forward projects that are consistent with the policy for sustainable  schools and with an area-based approach to planning. My Department will write  to the school managing authorities and the schools that are in the investment  delivery plan to inform them of the outcome of the review, and, where  appropriate, it will seek to resolve issues or concerns that may have arisen in  the review.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">C&eacute; go n-aithn&iacute;m go raibh frustrachas ar roinnt daoine mar  gheall ar an athbhreithni&uacute;, t&aacute; s&eacute; de dhualgas orm a chinnti&uacute; go nd&eacute;anann muid  an t-infheisti&uacute; ceart agus go dt&oacute;gann muid scoileanna at&aacute; oiri&uacute;nach don  todhcha&iacute;. T&aacute; m&eacute; s&aacute;sta anois go bhfuil na tionscadail sin a thabharfar ar  aghaidh chuig c&eacute;im na t&oacute;g&aacute;la oiri&uacute;naithe don todhcha&iacute;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although I recognise that the review has caused frustration  in some quarters, it is my duty to ensure that we make the right investment and  build schools that are fit for the future. I am now content that we have  future-proofed the projects that will be taken forward to construction. Of the  projects that are consistent or are likely to be deemed consistent after some  clarification, 13 are either at tender or pre-tender stage. I had hoped to be  in a position where some or all those projects had been given the go-ahead at  this point. However, with a reduced capital budget allocation available to me,  we are already overcommitted on capital spend, and those projects will be  delayed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, I would have liked to have seen another 10 or  so newbuilds to have proceeded on site before the end of the financial year.  That is still possible if I receive the moneys for which I bid in the June  monitoring rounds. If those additional funds are not allocated to the  Department of Education for capital build projects, I fear that a delay in commencing  those schools for some months is inevitable. We simply cannot build schools  without the money. Many teachers, parents, pupils and governors will be  disappointed at the delay. I share that disappointment. To state the obvious,  the rate at which the Department can build new schools is totally dependent on  available resources. However, my Department&rsquo;s budget has been reduced  significantly, and I now face a very challenging position regarding investment  in the schools estate. My Department has a net capital budget for 2010-11 of  &pound;169 million, which is over &pound;84 million lower in real terms than the net  capital budget of 2009-2010. That includes a cut of &pound;22 million that was made  to address the increased public expenditure pressures that face the Executive. It  would take over &pound;500 million at today&rsquo;s estimate to build all the projects in  the investment delivery plan list that are deemed viable and sustainable. If we  set that against the available budget, we will see that the future programme is  very bleak.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">N&iacute; f&eacute;idir linn dearmad a dh&eacute;anamh den chl&aacute;r t&oacute;g&aacute;la at&aacute; ar  si&uacute;l faoi l&aacute;thair &aacute;fach &ndash; t&oacute;gadh 39 scoil nua &oacute; mh&iacute; Bealtaine 2007, agus t&aacute; 13  eile acu a dt&oacute;g&aacute;il agus cuirfear i gcr&iacute;ch iad ar ball beag.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We must not lose sight of the building programme currently  under way. Thirty-nine new schools have been built since May 2007, and 13 more  are currently on site and will be completed in the near future. My Department  has to implement those cuts despite fully utilising the capital funds available  to it in the past two years, completing projects representing an investment of  over &pound;253 million in our schools estate since May 2007.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A delay in building new schools means that I will have increased  maintenance costs for the existing schools estate. The financial position for  maintenance and minor works is also very bleak. I have been able to allocate  only &pound;30 million to the minor works programme, which will help to alleviate  some of the worst conditions in a number of schools.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I desperately want to build new schools. In addition to the  schools on the investment delivery plan, there are a further 100 potential  projects at various stages of feasibility study and economic appraisal. All  those schools have been identified as having serious accommodation issues, and  all those projects need to be delivered.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Is f&eacute;idir liom a dhearbh&uacute; leis an Tion&oacute;l go leanfaidh m&eacute;  den bhr&uacute; le cist&iacute; breise caipitil a fh&aacute;il sa bhliain airgeadais seo, agus t&aacute;  s&uacute;il agam go bhfaighidh m&eacute; taca&iacute;ocht &oacute; gach p&aacute;irt&iacute; agus &oacute; gach Comhalta sna  babhta&iacute; le linn na bliana.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I assure the Assembly that I will continue to press for  additional capital funds in this financial year. I look forward to receiving  support from all parties and Members during in-year monitoring rounds. Further,  as 2010-11 is the last year of a three-year comprehensive spending review  period, I do not have a clear budget in place for future financial years. A new  comprehensive spending review will be initiated shortly, which will cover the  period until 2013-14.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I appeal to the Assembly: if we are serious about renewing  the fabric of our schools estate and allowing our young people to access their  education in modern, fit-for-purpose accommodation, we must ensure that capital  funding for the schools estate is a priority even in this extremely challenging  financial environment. I also believe that such capital investment has the  potential to assist the economic recovery, particularly for those working in  construction.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Ar deireadh, ba mhaith liom a chur in i&uacute;l go bhfuil m&eacute;  tiomanta don chaighde&aacute;n is fearr c&oacute;ir&iacute;ochta a chur ar f&aacute;il do dhaoine &oacute;ga. Is  ceist &iacute; seo a bhaineann le gach toghcheantar agus le gach p&aacute;irt&iacute; polait&iacute;ochta a  bhfuil ionada&iacute;ocht aige sa Tion&oacute;l.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am committed to providing the best standard of  accommodation for our young people. This is an issue for every constituency and  every political party represented in the House. It is a question of priority.  It is pointless for representatives to stand up and grandstand on issues such  as the capital build programme if they do not follow that through by impressing  on their colleagues who sit on the Executive the priority that these projects  should, in my view, enjoy, even in these difficult economic times.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">10.45 am</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education (Mr Storey)</strong>: We welcome the Minister to the  House today, one week late. Many will question the sincerity of the reasons  given as to why the Minister was not present last week to make an important  statement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for Education asked the Minister&rsquo;s officials,  on several occasions, for the terms of reference for her review on how  individual capital projects would be assessed and prioritised. Indeed, that  request was made directly to the Minister at a meeting of the Education  Committee on 3 February 2010. At that time, the Minister said:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the Department will be producing very clear criteria  for capital projects, and, at the appropriate time, I will provide those  criteria to the Committee.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">One hundred and ten days later, on 21 May, the  Minister, through her officials, sent to the Committee a departmental paper on  the agreed terms of reference, which included the already publicised  sustainable schools policy criteria but not the specific criteria requested by  the Committee. When will the Minister provide the Education Committee and  Members with the specific criteria on how capital projects have been assessed  and prioritised? When will she make available to Members the outcome of this  nine-month review in the form of a prioritised list of capital projects that  will be given the go-ahead? On 1 June, I wrote to the Minister to again ask how  capital projects would be prioritised. To date: no reply, no response. When  will she give that information to the House? When will the Minister write to  the managing authorities of the 13 schools mentioned in her report?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I make my concluding remarks as a private Member. The  Minister said that she wants the support of Members of the House. Until we on  this side of the House are convinced of the bona fides of the criteria being  used, the reality is, Minister, that we do not trust you to deal with such an  important issue and nor do the schools or the managing authorities out there.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Well, the Member is entitled to his opinion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: So is the &lsquo;Belfast Telegraph&rsquo;.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: The capital review will inform a more strategic approach to  capital investment decisions and the management of the schools estate. In light  of that, it is important that we validate that the capital projects in which we  invest are viable and sustainable in the long term.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that the House understands that, since I  came into office, we have built an enormous number of schools. We have spent  99&middot;9% of our budget. In the two years preceding my coming into office, direct  rule Ministers handed back &pound;62 million in one year and &pound;94 million of capital  build money the year after. That &pound;94 million could have built many of the  schools on the list. A lot of those schools should not be on this list, because  money was approved that was never spent. I have spent 99&middot;9% of my budget, and I  aim to continue to spend any money given to me for capital build. My big  message is &ldquo;Give me money and I will build schools&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: &mdash; as I and my Department have done in the past two years.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, it was essential that we carried out a capital  review. The reason for that is that on top of direct rule Ministers not  spending their capital funding, they built schools that became empty a couple  of years later because they did not plan the schools estate. We are planning  the schools estate. We are not going to waste public money building schools  that will be empty in two or three years&rsquo; time. That is why it is essential  that our newbuilds are fully compliant with our policies, including area-based  planning, Every School a Good   School, the revised  curriculum, the sustainable schools policy, the Irish-medium review and the  entitlement framework. I hope that that approach is supported by the  Chairperson of the Education Committee and by everyone else, because I am sure  that nobody in the House would say that we should not be building schools on an  area-based planning basis.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I did provide information to the Committee. The Committee  has information. I ask the Chairperson of the Committee to depart from his  normal way of operating and work with me on this important issue. I ask that,  for once, instead of grandstanding, political point scoring and delivering  personal insults, he change his focus on this key issue, which affects every  person in the House and children in every constituency. I ask people not to  play politics with this. Let us do everything that we can to prioritise school  building. I have had &pound;22 million cut from my budget. I need funding so that I  can build schools. We can do it. We have done it, and we will continue to do  it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr O&rsquo;Dowd: Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. As a  member of the Education Committee, I find it disappointing that, every time we  discuss an education matter in the House, our Chairperson acts like a badly  behaved schoolboy in a classroom. That reflects badly not only on him but on  the Committee. I assure the House that if the Chairperson of a Committee from  my party were to behave like that, they would no longer be a Chairperson &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: What about the Minister?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Member should continue.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  We expect a certain amount of decorum &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  We expect a certain amount of decorum and professionalism from our Members, and  perhaps you should learn from that. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  The Member is still acting like a badly behaved schoolboy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To the matter in hand: I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comment  that over 98% &mdash; it may have been 99% &mdash; of her budget has been spent on school  builds. It has not been handed back to the centre; it has been spent. How can  the Chairperson of the Committee for Education, speaking as an individual, say  that he does not trust the Minister? Surely the figures speak for themselves.  Give the Minister the money, and schools will be built.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">How does a school get itself on to the building programme?  What actions should a school that is not on the list take?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I thank the Member for outlining to the House the fact that we  have spent money and for his support for my bids to get more money. We have  spent the money, amounting not to 99% &mdash; it is even better than that &mdash; but to  99&middot;9%. That level of spending has never been achieved before.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">How will a school get on to the school building programme?  In his report, George Bain recommended a more strategic approach to planning. I  intend to bring forward area-based planning at the earliest opportunity. My  Department will now write to all schools and work with all managing  authorities, informing them of any issues. It will not be a one-size-fits-all  approach, because different schools have different issues. For example, in a  particular area, two schools that are near to each other might be encroaching  on each other&rsquo;s enrolment figures, so it may be a case of CCMS or the relevant  board sitting down with the schools, pointing out that the situation cannot  continue and working out how they can work together. Alternatively, a school in  the post-primary sector may be deemed not to be participating fully in the  area-based planning approach and the entitlement framework approach. We cannot  &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span> I see that the Chairperson is  interrupting again.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We cannot have the situation that exists in some towns, in  which four or five A-level classes for the same subject are run with a couple  of young people in each. Surely, the proper way to deal with that situation is  to have one A-level class in the area, rather than wasting scarce resources &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: We have a situation in which primary school classes have 28 or  30 children in them. We have to take a mature, more thought-out and strategic  approach to how we manage our schools estate. In order to take a more strategic  approach, my Department will work very closely with the boards, CCMS, the  various managing authorities, Comhairle na Gaelscola&iacute;ochta and all the  organisations that work with schools. However, that would be much easier to do  if we had the ESA on board, as it should have been from January. The  Chairperson of the Committee for Education is laughing. I ask him to reflect on  that, because, by attempting to block the ESA, he is trying to delay many of  the key issues in education.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I listened to the Minister talking about her 99&middot;9% success, but, of course,  many spending decisions are to do with how planning decisions come through from  the authorities. What impact has the &pound;84 million reduction in real terms had on  her setting of targets? The Minister said that the implementation of all  projects on the IDP list would cost over &pound;500 million. She also talked about  being able to allocate only &pound;30 million to the minor works programme, which  needs &pound;100 million, and about maintenance problems. I understand that the  amounts available are &pound;100 million for essential maintenance and &pound;300 million  for other types of maintenance. It seems, therefore, that we have a problem.  Will the Minister outline how she whittles down those projects that passed her  review &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member should come to his question.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  She must whittle down the projects. What criteria will she use? When will she  tell the House which school projects will proceed and which will not?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: The response to the Member&rsquo;s point about the &pound;84 million is that  the difference is 0&middot;6%. In 2008, my Department spent 99&middot;3% of its budget. Given  that very good track record, I hope that the Executive Ministers from the  Member&rsquo;s party will support my bids in the June monitoring round.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have already answered the question on criteria.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  Given that the Minister did not answer the Committee Chairperson&rsquo;s questions, I  ask again what criteria she used to make her decisions. Her poor statement will  give no comfort to anyone in the school community. What about the schools that  have been waiting for 17 or 18 years for a school building? When exactly will  the schools be told what is happening?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I have answered the question on criteria.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  You have not.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I agree with the Member that, historically, the schools estate  has been neglected. It was dreadful that direct rule Ministers handed back so  much money. That should not have happened, it is not happening on my watch &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: &mdash; and I do not intend it to happen on my watch &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I intend to spend every penny that is given to me.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: The statement  is disappointing for all the schools concerned. Will the Minister name the 13  schools that are at tender or pre-tender stage and the additional 10 schools?  Will she also outline to the House the priority order of those schools? When  money becomes available, which school project will start first and which will  be last?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: My Department will contact all schools on the programme. I do  not intend to name schools in the House today. Now that the review is complete,  the Department has work to do with each school. We will write to the schools  today.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hilditch</strong>:  We have concentrated on the capital fund today, but will the Minister tell us  what sort of thinking outside the box is going on? What initiatives involving  the private sector and other agencies and bodies could provide modular-type  buildings that have a lifespan of between 20 and 30 years and could get us out  of the current predicament? One such initiative in my constituency involves the  YMCA in Carrickfergus. Agencies can put together a cocktail of funding to  provide multiuse educational buildings. What initiatives that involve the  private sector and other agencies are taking place?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: That is a good question, and the Department is exploring various  build options. We are also trying to ensure that public money is used in the  most effective way and that schools are open to and used by the public. With  cross-departmental support, we are considering, for example, sports provision.  I had a meeting with Minister McCausland about how to co-ordinate the resources  of his Department and mine. There is no point in building pitches, sports  grounds and buildings unless they have been planned in a cohesive and strategic  way. However, my officials and I would be happy to hear the Member&rsquo;s ideas. In  the current environment, we must explore every option.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.00 am</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Leonard</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for her statement.  Does she think that any school building projects will go forward this financial  year?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Currently, 13 schools are on site, and Whitehouse Primary School  will be going on site very soon. I would love to get more schools on site, but  that will depend on the results of my bid in the June monitoring round and  other in-year monitoring rounds. However, this monitoring round is very  important, because we need resources. Members will understand that resources  are needed for planning. Therefore, it is essential that all parties in the  House support our bids in the June monitoring rounds.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If Members were to look at the 39 schools that have been  built and the 14 that are on site or just about to go on site, they would see  that they are in every constituency, in every county and from all sectors. I  ask Members to reflect on that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  Will the Minister clarify her position on PPP projects and how she accounts for  them as opposed to traditional procurement? Given the tight financial budget  that we face, does she agree that prioritising investment in minor works and  refurbishment would make a significant difference for the greatest number of  schools in the shortest time frame?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: My position on PPP projects is very clear. I do not believe that  they are the best way to go forward. I do not believe that they provide best  value &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I do not believe that PPP projects provide best value for money.  I inherited some PPP projects, which have gone ahead as a result, but I have  not initiated any new PPP projects. I believe that there is a better way of  doing it, and I believe that the way that we are doing it at present is better.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Of course we have to look at maintenance and continue with  our maintenance budgets. However, it is very short-sighted to focus on  maintenance and not on newbuilds, because that would mean that the schools  estate would just be maintained and a situation would be created where there is  constant maintenance but no newbuilds.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her statement. As someone who spent 30 years in a  classroom, I assure her that I have no intention of grandstanding on such a  serious issue. The Minister told us that, apart from the shortage of capital  funds, she has only &pound;30 million for minor works. Does that mean that our  children in many areas will have to cope with more dilapidated huts, more leaky  roofs, more chills and colds, more asthma attacks and more days off school?  When will our children have the human right to be taught in buildings that are  fit for purpose? Will the Minister assure us that we are not going back to  hedge schools?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Our children have those human rights now. Those rights are  universal. However, the Executive need to meet the rights of those children and  provide funding to my Department to ensure that those young people are not in  draughty classrooms and that they are not in schools that are in the state that  I have seen some of them in. I am not going to stand here and justify the state  of our schools. Some of our schools are in dreadful disrepair. There has been  historical neglect in our education estate, and it is simply not good enough.  Therefore, there is a responsibility on the Executive to provide me with the  necessary budget so that I can build schools. I have shown that we can do it,  and I have shown that we can spend budgets.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Of course we are not going back to hedge schools. Hedge  schools did not have buildings, although they did have a little bit of shelter.  Nevertheless, I do not denigrate the learning that was done in hedge schools.  They were involved in tremendous learning during very difficult times in Ireland.  However, I take the Member&rsquo;s point. Of course we are not going back to the  infrastructure of hedge schools, but our curriculum could learn a lot from  theirs.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for her  statement. My question, which other Members partly asked, concerns  consideration of schools that have major works that are at the early planning  stage. How will those be included in the Department&rsquo;s investment delivery plan?  With your indulgence, a Cheann Comhairle, the last question that I will ask is  about the list. Will the list of the schools that are to be built be published  after the Minister has made her statement today?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: The list of schools will not be published after my statement  today. However, my Department will write to all the schools and their managing  authorities and will discuss with them what needs to happen. The Member will be  aware that each school has different issues, and those issues must be  discussed. Some can be resolved fairly speedily, but others will take a little  more time.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">With respect to the first part of the Member&rsquo;s question,  the Department will use area-based planning to build the schools estate. The  needs in each area will be examined, as will the demographic trends and the  number of children entering preschool, primary and post-primary education. The  Department will not build schools on every corner, but it will build a schools  estate that is fit for purpose and meets the needs of young people. There must  also be greater collaboration between schools, because we cannot continue with  the situation that we had in the past in which each school operated in a silo.  Schools must be part of their area learning communities and deliver the  entitlement framework with other schools in their area. They must work together  for the children.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>:  Some schools in my constituency could face closure on health and safety  grounds, as is the case with schools in other Members&rsquo; constituencies.  Therefore, the Minister&rsquo;s statement this morning is very disappointing. It  contained no details about when we will hear which schools are involved.  Therefore, there is little point in asking about that. However, will the  Minister give a guarantee to the House that schools will be on the list because  of need rather than the area of Northern    Ireland in which they are located or the  community background of the children?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: The schools that have been built since I came into office were  in every sector and every constituency. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I hope that the Member is not suggesting that there has been  inequality in the school building programme. If he is suggesting that, perhaps  he can tell us where that inequality exists. It is very easy to make false and  wrong accusations &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: It would be better for the Member to think about how his  Executive colleagues can support me during the June monitoring process. He must  be very careful before he makes wrong accusations, because the approved schools  are in every single constituency and every sector. I ask that Members do not  play politics with the issue.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I note that some &pound;30 million is being  spent on maintenance. Will the Minister clarify how her Department will tackle  the backlog in that area?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: The education and library boards are responsible for maintenance  across the schools estate. They are working to address the backlog and have  procedures in place to prioritise carefully the areas of greatest need,  including health and safety issues. The nature of that task includes any urgent  work that is required to address health and safety issues and to avoid any  serious deterioration of the fabric or the services of the building. Items must  also be deemed to be in a very poor condition. I will continue to press the  Executive for further funding for maintenance. It is good to hear that  maintenance is a concern among Members, and I look forward to the support of  all parties in addressing that concern.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a maintenance backlog of &pound;88,273 in the Belfast  Education and Library Board area &mdash; sorry, that should be &pound;88,273,000;  &pound;46,410,758 in the Western Education and Library Board area; &pound;60,071,703 in the  Southern Education and Library Board area; &pound;36,642,750 in the South Eastern  Education and Library Board area; and &pound;55,504,000 in the North Eastern  Education and Library Board area. Therefore, there is a serious problem with  the maintenance backlog. The schools estate is facing serious difficulties and  is in need of urgent support from the Executive.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  note that the Minister is not giving any indication today of where individual  schools stand on the list. However, can she confirm that the four schools in  Holywood, which were the subject of a debate here some time ago and are part of  an overall schools project for capital build, and Bangor Grammar School  in my constituency will be written to as part of the series of letters  concerning capital build? Will those schools receive any definitive indication  in those letters as to when new capital build is due to take place?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: We will write to all schools today in relation to the completion  of capital build. Obviously, I am not going to go into individual schools in  Members&rsquo; individual constituencies &mdash; the House is not the place for that &mdash; but  my Department will write to all schools.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  The Minister&rsquo;s statement was very poor, and it was very disappointing for the  schools in my constituency. The Minister referred to the fact that 39 new  schools have been built since 2007 and 13 more are on site. I take it that  those decisions were made under direct rule. It is estimated that 40% of school  places are empty. What impact do those empty school places have on the newbuild  programme? The Minister has yet to answer the questions. What criteria were  used? When will we, as Members, know definitively which school newbuilds will  proceed?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Actually, the Assembly made decisions in relation to the  investment programme. Maybe the Member has forgotten about the Programme for  Government and the investment delivery plan. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Her party voted for that and supported it. It was not direct  rule Ministers who took those decisions; it was me in the first instance and  then the Executive and the Assembly. The Member needs to get her facts right.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Givan</strong>: It  is interesting that the Minister wants to claim credit for all the school  builds that the education and library boards have delivered but, Pontius  Pilate-like, washes her hands of the boards&rsquo; decisions to cut special needs  programmes. I am sure that the Minister will agree with me that it is her  failure that has allowed a maintenance backlog of almost &pound;300 million to build  up. The Minister&rsquo;s decision has led to a situation in which our schools are  crumbling. Inaction is putting our children&rsquo;s education in jeopardy, and the  Minister is failing to take her responsibility seriously.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I ask the Member to come to his question.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Givan</strong>:  Rather than appealing to the Assembly, the Minister needs to take her duties  seriously and get on with the job.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I understand that the Member is new. He is very welcome to the  House, and it is good to see our new Members coming forward. However, I  respectfully suggest that the Member go back and look at the amount of money  that was spent before I came into post. In case he does not have time to do  that, I can tell him that &pound;62 million was handed back two years before I came  into post and &pound;94 million the year before I came into post. That is where the  inaction was. I do not know what part of 99&middot;9% of a capital budget the Member  does not understand. If he does not understand it, he needs to go and do his  sums.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is no inaction on my part, and there is no inaction  on my officials&rsquo; part. They are absolutely clear on the priority that needed to  be given to capital build projects. Often, officials do not get credit. We are  always ready to criticise, and rightly so. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: However, our Department deserves credit and support rather than  criticism here. We have done the business and we have the track record. We are  now saying: give us more money and we will continue to do the business.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This is not a debate about the special needs programme, but  I will answer the point that was raised. I do not believe that the boards  should have cut special needs summer schemes. I am absolutely clear on that. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: The boards have substantial budgets, and I do not believe that  they should have done that. It was a wrong decision.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Despite the fact that my resource budget has been cut, we  have increased money for special needs provision. We have increased the numbers  of children who receive free school meals and we have given an extra &pound;90 to  each primary-school child. The boards should not have started with special  needs children. The Member needs to talk to the boards about that. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.15 am</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: The real issue is that we should have ESA on board. I do not  believe that the boards are fit for purpose any longer. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: They may have been in the past but they are not now, and that is  not a criticism of any individuals on the boards. Everyone in the House knows  that we need to establish the Education and Skills Authority. That is what is  going to make the change, and the Members opposite, including the Chairperson  of the Committee, who is interrupting again, need to understand their role in  bringing about the establishment of the Education and Skills Authority and  stopping the squandering and wasting of money that results from the duplication  of administration. I want to get money into the front line and into the school  build programme. I want better planning in the school build programme, and the  way to do that is by having one organisation.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  How are schools supposed to plan for the future if they are not going to be  told whether they are towards the top or towards the bottom of a long list? Is  the talk of the June monitoring round somewhat of a cop-out? As the Minister  well knows, this year&rsquo;s monitoring rounds will be used to deal with the &pound;128  million in cuts that the Treasury has asked for. Would the Minister not be  better off showing leadership by taking and advocating tough decisions over  raising revenue through things like water charges so that we have money to  invest in schools and hospitals?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Our Department will liaise with all the schools, discuss the  issues that relate to them and work with them at each phase of the process.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to the monitoring rounds, the Member must have  been a fly on the wall at the Executive. I am not going into any of the detail  on what was discussed, but his information is incorrect. I want money from the  monitoring round. I am delighted to see the level of concern in the House, and  I expect support from each and every Minister from all parties if we are  serious about getting schools built. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. Allow the Minister to continue.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: We are ready to spend the money, and I am ready to build new  schools. Give me the money, and we will do it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her statement. She stated that the review is complete  and that she wanted to update Members on the review of all school capital build  programmes. I came here expecting to see a list of schools that had been  approved and information on what was going to happen and what was not. To me,  this is not really an update. I note from her statement that a number of school  projects cannot be taken forward as proposed. Why has the Assembly not been  advised even of that list? It is important that we be provided with that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I assume that the Minister is fully versed in the policy on  sustainable schools, to which her statement referred. I wish to ask a question  about a school in my constituency, which I am mandated to do. The Minister has  made many visits to Carrick   Primary School outside  Warrenpoint.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I invite the Member to come to his question.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  Can the Minister confirm or deny that Carrick Primary School  meets the criteria of the policy for sustainable schools?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I do not know why the Member thought that a list would be  provided. He has obviously not been listening to any of my media interviews. I  have been very clear that a list was never going to be presented, because that  is not the way that we do business. The way that we do business is that we  engage with each school and with the managing authorities, such as the boards  and CCMS. I do not know why the Member expected a list. I will not comment on  individual schools; I have said that already. My Department will liaise with  each school.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Is it not true, Minister, that this is not an update but more of a cop-out? You  keep talking about &ldquo;we&rdquo; and the criteria. As you have not told us what the  criteria are, perhaps you could define &ldquo;we&rdquo;. It certainly is not this House or  the Education Committee.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I am not sure that I understand the question. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: The question was very obscure. We approved the investment  delivery plan, and I hope that we all understand the importance of school  builds. If John McCallister does not understand it, I will be a bit worried.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. That ends questions on the ministerial statement.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Leonard</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. Is it in order that, during a ministerial  statement, behaviour that is tantamount to serial ignorance floats from one  person. I estimate that you had to call one person to order at least a dozen  times. It truly and utterly shows the place to be a disgrace and indicates that  more latitude is, perhaps, given to one person than to any other, which could  bring the Assembly into further disgrace. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. Let me say to the whole House &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span> Order. Let me say to the whole House that I expect every Member to respect the  procedures of this House. Let me make it absolutely clear that Ministers,  irrespective of who they are, should not be interrupted when delivering a  speech.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Every Member in the House has had an opportunity this  morning to ask a question to the Education Minister. However, let me make it  clear that Members should not try to speak from a sedentary position. That is  totally out of order. It is my job as Speaker to protect the integrity of this  House and the business in it. I intend to do that now and in the future. I do  not care which Minister comes to the House with a statement or other business;  I will protect that Minister and any Member of this House who rises to speak. I  want to make that absolutely clear.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. I welcome your commitment to protecting the  integrity of every Member in the Chamber. Would the integrity of this House not  be better protected if the Minister asked the question when answered? <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Member is slightly mixed up. I will try to respond on the basis of  what I think the Member tried to say. I have often said in this House that, as  Speaker, it is not my duty, irrespective of who the Minister is, to sit in  judgement of how a Minister answers a question. I do not intend to do that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I will call Lord Morrow then I will cut this. I have to say that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  You are quite right that it is not your duty to tell the Minister how to  answer. However, it would be appropriate if, occasionally, an answer is given.  Bearing in mind that the Minister did not consider it worth her while to come  to this House last week to make the statement, and she gave an alleged reason &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  We hear the crowd warbling on the wall over here. Maybe the individual who was  lecturing will take notice of the individuals beside him and have a chat with  them. He comes in here as a paragon of virtue and tries to lecture everybody  else as to what they should or should not be doing.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">Mr Leonard</span>: &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">Lord Morrow</span><span class="Italic">: </span>No, Mr Leonard, you have a lot to learn in a whole lot of  ways.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. This is turning into a debate. As far as possible, let me make it clear  to the entire House that, if a Minister totally refuses to answer a question,  it is a different issue. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span> Order. In  that event, I have a responsibility as Speaker. However, it is entirely up to  Ministers how they answer a question. Once again, I say to the whole House that  I will not sit in judgment of how a Minister delivers an answer in this House.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I will take one further point of order from Mr McCrea, after which I will move  on.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I am grateful, and I will not press your patience. However, with respect, it is  disappointing that, when I asked a direct question, the Minister said that she  felt that she had already answered it. Later in the debate, a similar question  was asked and was given a fulsome response. I ask for your support, Mr Speaker.  All I am trying to do is ask a question. We need some guidance on how we can  have a proper debate about these important issues.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Members who are not satisfied with the answers that they have received from the  Minister should take it up with the Minister directly. I will now move on. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.] </span>Order.</p>

    <p class="H4StageHeading">Welfare of Animals Bill: Second Stage</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development (Ms Gildernew)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a  Cheann Comhairle. I beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That the Second Stage of the Welfare of Animals Bill [NIA  28/09] be agreed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill is the result of four years&rsquo; work by my  Department, beginning with the public consultation in late 2006. When I came to  office in 2007, I wanted to hear at first hand stakeholders&rsquo; views and opinions  on animal welfare. Over the past two years, my officials and I have engaged in  13 meetings with stakeholders, such as the Northern Ireland Companion Animal  Welfare Committee, the Captive Animals&rsquo; Protection Society, the Born Free  Foundation and the League Against Cruel Sports. Those meetings culminated in a  major animal welfare stakeholder workshop in September 2009, which was attended  by 38 representatives from 21 animal welfare and stakeholder organisations. I  listened carefully to the concerns and views expressed during those meetings  and took them into account when developing my policy proposals and drafting the  Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The proposed new legislation has been welcomed by all  stakeholders, who have expressed strong support for many of its provisions.  Before I set out the key features of the Bill, I thank everyone who responded  to the consultation exercise that my Department carried out. I thank those who  attended meetings with me or my officials and those who attended the  stakeholder workshop last year. I appreciate the input of all the stakeholders,  which has contributed significantly to the Bill. I also thank the Chairperson  and members of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development for  facilitating presentations from my officials on four occasions and for their  comments. They have also helped to shape the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Before turning to some of the main provisions in the Bill,  let me outline its background and the need for new legislation. The Bill is  intended to replace the Welfare of Animals Act (NI) 1972, which is almost 40  years old and is no longer sufficient to deal with animal welfare issues. It  updates and strengthens the powers in the 1972 Act. The new powers in the Bill  will address the gap between the high level of protection afforded to farmed  animals compared with the limited protection given to non-farmed animals,  including domestic pets.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The 1972 Act is the only welfare legislation in place that  seeks to combat cruelty to non-farmed animals such as horses, cats and dogs.  However, welfare legislation relating specifically to farmed animals has  progressed at a much faster rate, keeping abreast of advances in scientific  knowledge, thus the emphasis on farmed animal welfare is not simply on  preventing cruelty but on securing an acceptable standard of welfare for  animals. It means that farmers must provide for the needs of their animals and  not merely avoid causing them unnecessary suffering. However, that has not been  the case for non-farmed animals. The Welfare of Animals Bill bridges that gap  by extending the requirement to provide for the needs of an animal to anyone  responsible for any kind of animal, including a domestic pet.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The key benefits of the new Welfare of Animals Bill are  that a duty of care will be provided to all protected animals, including  domestic pets and horses; it will be possible to take action to prevent animals  from suffering, as opposed to the current position where action can only be  taken after suffering has occurred; the current powers will be strengthened in  respect of animal fighting, including dog fighting; powers will be provided to  regulate, through subordinate legislation, a wide range of activities involving  animals, such as dog breeding establishments, the use of animals in travelling  circuses and the keeping of non-dangerous exotic pets; and the Bill will  increase the penalties for serious animal welfare offences.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If the Assembly agrees today, the Committee for Agriculture  and Rural Development will scrutinise the Bill on a clause-by-clause basis.  Therefore, I do not intend to go through each clause and schedule individually  today, but I will take a few minutes and set out the key elements.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The Bill is set out in six parts, with a total of  60 clauses and five schedules. The first 18 clauses and schedule 1 set out the  substantive policy behind the Bill, while the remaining clauses and schedules  outline the procedural aspects of how the Bill can be implemented.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.30 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Part 1 outlines the scope of the Bill, which covers all  vertebrate animals. There is also power to extend in the future the definition  of &ldquo;animal&rdquo; to include invertebrates if scientific evidence becomes available  that those animals are capable of feeling pain. Although all vertebrate animals  will have protection from cruelty and unnecessary suffering, protected animals  will be afforded a higher level of protection. Protected animals are defined as  animals that are commonly domesticated in the North of Ireland. Other animals  are also protected if they are under the control of man or not living in a wild  state. The Bill defines who is responsible for an animal. Although the owner is  always regarded as responsible for an animal, a person who is in charge of an  animal on a temporary or permanent basis is also responsible for that animal  while it is under his or her care.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Part 2 of the Bill sets out powers for the protection of  animals through the prevention of harm and the promotion of welfare. That part  of the Bill carries forward from the 1972 Act a number of provisions to prevent  animals from harm. Those are the cruelty offence of causing unnecessary  suffering; prohibited procedures that are referred to in the 1972 Act as cruel  operations; administration of poisons; and animal-fighting offences. In  carrying those forward, I have retained the substance of the provisions but  have simplified and updated them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It would be beneficial to outline the stronger powers in  respect of animal fighting. Those will, of course, cover all animal fighting,  including dogfighting and cockfighting. Substantial powers already exist under  the 1972 Act in respect of animal fighting. It is currently an offence to cause  unnecessary suffering to an animal by causing, procuring or assisting at an  animal fight; promoting, causing or permitting any performance; taking part in  an animal fight; keeping, using, managing, permitting or assisting in the  keeping of any premises for animal fighting; receiving, causing or procuring  money for admission to an animal fight; and being a spectator at an animal  fight.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic" align="center" style="text-align:center;">(Mr Deputy  Speaker [Mr Molloy] in the Chair)</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said on Monday 7 June 2010, when the Assembly debated  the Dogs (Amendment) Bill, those current offences will be enhanced in this new  Bill. In other words, they will become offences regardless of whether  unnecessary suffering is caused. In addition, new powers will be added to make  it an offence to keep or to train an animal for use in connection with an  animal fight. Therefore, if evidence is present, such as training equipment  etc, the power will be there to seize a dog even before it ever fights. The  Bill will also make it an offence to cause an animal fight to take place or to  attempt to do so; to supply, publish or show a video recording of an animal  fight; to possess a video recording of an animal fight with the intention to  supply it; and to place or to accept a bet on an animal fight.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, the penalties for animal fighting will be  increased from a maximum of three months&rsquo; imprisonment and/or a &pound;5,000 fine to  a maximum of two years&rsquo; imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine. Other new powers  allow for the destruction of animals involved in fighting offences, forfeiture  of equipment and reimbursement of expenses incurred by the PSNI in connection  with keeping animals involved in those offences.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Powers are also included to allow a court to disqualify a  person who is convicted of animal-fighting offences for any one or more of the  following: owning animals; keeping animals; participating in the keeping of  animals; controlling or influencing the way that animals are kept; dealing in  animals; transporting animals; and arranging for the transport of animals. A  court can also cancel any current welfare licence or disqualify a person from  holding the licence following a conviction in respect of animal fighting.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I believe that those new powers will strengthen existing  powers significantly and send a strong message out to those individuals who are  involved in that type of abhorrent activity that animal fighting is not  acceptable in civilised society.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill&rsquo;s key aims are not only to stop cruelty and  unnecessary suffering but to promote and to enhance the welfare of all  protected animals. In a bid to prevent pups from suffering unnecessarily, the  Bill imposes a specific statutory ban on the docking of dogs&rsquo; tails unless it  is undertaken by a veterinary surgeon for a dog&rsquo;s medical treatment or to save  its life. The Bill also makes it an offence to take a dog to another jurisdiction  to have its tail docked.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The promotion of welfare is at the heart of the  legislation, and the provisions in Part 2 of the Bill bring the protection  afforded to non-farmed animals into line with that given to farmed animals.  Under the 1972 Act, a person can be prosecuted for causing unnecessary  suffering to any animal, including a domestic pet. However, there are cases  where, although animals are not yet suffering, their welfare needs are not  being met. Under current legislation, enforcement action can be taken against  owners of farm livestock, but owners of domestic animals and horses can only be  encouraged to improve the conditions in which their animals are kept.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill addresses that anomaly by placing a general duty  on a person to ensure that the needs of any vertebrate animal for which they  are responsible are met to the extent required by good practice. That is often  defined as the five freedoms: the need for a suitable environment; the need for  a suitable diet; the need to exhibit normal behaviour; the need to be housed  with or apart from other animals, as appropriate; and the need to be protected  from pain, suffering, injury and disease. To comply with that duty, owners and  keepers will need to understand their responsibilities and take all reasonable  steps to provide for the needs of their animals.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">While there are many sources of information to help owners  and keepers understand how to look after their domestic animals, my Department  will try to help further by producing codes of practice, under clause 16,  similar to those widely used for farm animals. All such codes will be subject  to consultation with stakeholders. To help promote animal welfare, the Bill  creates a more flexible statutory framework than that available under the 1972  Act. It sets out the key principles, but leaves detailed matters to subordinate  legislation. I believe that that flexibility is critical if our legislation is  to keep pace with advances in animal welfare.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill therefore provides primary powers to make regulations  to secure the welfare of animals, to license or register activities involving  animals and to prohibit the keeping of certain animals. For almost 40 years, we  have had regulatory powers under the 1972 Act to secure the welfare of farmed  animals, and those have generally worked well. They have enabled us to keep up  to date with the latest advice and scientific evidence without needing to come  to the Assembly to change primary legislation. In the Bill, those new powers  will be extended to non-farmed animals, including domestic pets.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The 1972 Act provided limited powers to license pet shops  and animal boarding, riding and zoological establishments. The powers in the  new Bill will allow us to extend the licensing or registration requirement to  cover other types of establishments, such as animal sanctuaries, open farms and  breeding establishments. Using subordinate legislation to introduce the  detailed requirements in those areas will ensure that the relevant stakeholders  are consulted on the issues which directly affect them and will help us get the  balance right in protecting the animals and avoiding unnecessary burdens on  businesses.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Earlier this month, when the Assembly discussed the Dogs  (Amendment) Bill, the issue of dog breeding establishments was raised. I will  use the powers in the Welfare of Animals Bill to regulate and license dog  breeding establishments, to improve the standards for those establishments and  to assist legitimate local breeders in marketing their dogs. Substandard  breeders will have to raise their games, or they will not be licensed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Following consideration of the available scientific  evidence, the powers in the Bill will also allow me to regulate or prohibit the  keeping of wild animals in travelling circuses and, if necessary, the keeping  of exotic animals as pets. In seeking the power to make regulations, I will  provide two assurances to the Assembly. First, the welfare of animals will not  have to wait until the subordinate legislation is made. Animals will benefit  immediately from the introduction of the welfare offence and the duty of care.  Secondly, all new subordinate legislation under the powers in the Bill will be  subject to consultation with stakeholders and scrutiny by the Agriculture and  Rural Development Committee. Many will be subject to the affirmative resolution  procedure.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In promoting animal welfare, a principle of the Bill is  that responsibility for animals must rest with adults. For that reason, the  Bill makes it clear that parents or guardians are responsible in law for the  welfare of their children&rsquo;s animals. The Bill sets the minimum age at which  children can buy animals at 16 years. Clause 15 makes it an offence to give an  animal as a prize to anyone under 16, unless the child is accompanied by an  adult who is responsible for the care and control of the child.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I stress that those provisions will not prevent a  child from keeping or looking after pets or from actively learning about the  husbandry needs of animals. I fully accept that that can be a very important  aspect of a child&rsquo;s education. However, the Bill will ensure that a responsible  adult makes the decision about the keeping of a pet.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Part 3 of the Bill deals with animals in distress and sets  out the steps that an inspector or constable can take to immediately alleviate  an animal&rsquo;s suffering or to prevent an animal from suffering if its  circumstances do not change. The clauses in Part 3 also outline the powers of  entry and provide powers to apply to the Magistrate&rsquo;s Court in advance of any  criminal hearing for disposal of the animals taken into the possession of the  enforcement body. Part 3 of the Bill also provides safeguards for the owner of  the animals. Following the court&rsquo;s determination, nothing can be done with the  animals until either the period given for notice of appeal has expired or, if  an appeal has been lodged, it has been determined or withdrawn. Entry to a  private dwelling will, in the main, be by warrant. Schedule 3 to the Bill sets  out a range of safeguards for powers of entry, inspection and search under  warrant. Those include the use of a code of practice similar to that agreed for  the Diseases of Animals Act 2010.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Part 4 of the Bill deals with enforcement and sets out the  powers of entry for all offences in the Bill and general powers of inspection.  To act as a deterrent, an increased penalty will be introduced for very serious  welfare offences, such as animal fighting and cruelty offences. The current  penalty of a maximum of three months&rsquo; imprisonment and/or a &pound;5,000 fine will be  increased to a maximum of two years&rsquo; imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Enforcement of the powers in the Bill will be the key to  its success. Under the new powers in the Bill, many of the existing  arrangements will remain in place. For example, similar to the arrangements  already in place, my Department will appoint inspectors to implement and  enforce powers in respect of farmed animals on agricultural land. The powers  that are currently afforded to the PSNI will remain, and the PSNI will, as  necessary, continue to provide support for the appointed inspectors. The PSNI  will also lead on welfare issues involving organised animal fighting or where  other criminal activities are involved. The Bill will provide powers to  councils to appoint inspectors. It is proposed that councils will implement and  enforce provisions in respect of non-farmed animals.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This legislation, if enacted, will keep us at the forefront  of the protection of farmed and non-farmed animals. I commend the Bill to the  Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development (Mr Elliott)</strong>:  On behalf of the Committee I thank the Minister for bringing the Bill so far. I  welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill today. I will keep my comments  short, as the Committee has already had a number of discussions with the  Department on the matter, and, undoubtedly, will do so again in the months  ahead.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill is important because it aligns the welfare of  domesticated and non-farmed animals with that of farmed animals. The Bill  supersedes the Welfare of Animals Act (Northern Ireland) 1972, which is  almost 40 years old. It is also important because it creates new offences to  protect animals from abandonment, from suffering and from being used by  criminals in fights and baiting.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is unfortunate, therefore, that the Bill is almost void  of any detail. Despite the fact that it contains 60 clauses and there are five  schedules, it is empty. The Department describes it as an enabling Bill,  stating that the detail will follow in the form of subordinate legislation. The  Department says that that will provide it with the flexibility to quickly  update the legislation, to provide the depth that is required and to respond to  technological developments. We are expected to hand the Department the power to  make regulations to secure the welfare of animals and to delegate regulations  for the introduction of licensing and registration regimes for any activity  involving animals. We are also expected to enable the Department to secure  animal welfare by prohibiting the keeping of certain types of animals at  domestic or other premises. To do that without seeing the detail is neither  reasonable nor feasible.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee does not share the Department&rsquo;s view, and it  is, again, unfortunate that the Department has not learned any lessons from  previous Committee Stages. The Department will argue that the Committee will  have the opportunity to examine the detail during the policy stages of the  subordinate legislation processes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">However, the Committee has always argued that, if  it is relevant, if there is a genuine need to legislate, and if the evidence  presents itself, it should be included in primary legislation. We do not  believe in giving the Department powers without knowing their detail, and we  will not start now.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.45 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department wants the Bill to progress through the House  during the current mandate, and the Committee for Agriculture and Rural  Development shares that objective. However, we do not intend to rush it through  Committee Stage so that we can tick a box. As I stated, it is an important Bill  that deals with important issues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill is empty not only because of the absence of detail  that I mentioned, but because it avoids tackling issues that are relevant to  the welfare of animals. It is almost as though the Minister and the Department,  in their quest to earn brownie points by passing another Bill, want to avoid  controversial issues, with the exception of tail docking. It contains nothing  on securing the welfare of progeny, the use of wild animals in circuses or the  keeping of primates as pets. All those issues were raised during stakeholders&rsquo;  presentations to the Committee.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill includes nothing on the regulation of breeding  establishments, despite that industry&rsquo;s pleas to the Minister and the  Department. The industry wanted regulation and controls to stamp out those  practices that contribute to the appalling number of dogs, for example, that  have to be put down each year in Northern Ireland. While all others  in the agrifood sector call for fewer regulations, here is a sector that wants  more controls in place. Yet, for some inexplicable reason, the Department said  no. Perhaps that is another example of the detail that has yet to come.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It appears that the Department tried to steer clear of  controversy. Unfortunately, through the creation of an offence that relates to  tail docking, it failed. That issue was at the centre of some heated debates at  Committee and during the Department&rsquo;s public consultations. Clauses 5 and 6 will  continue to attract much attention today and at Committee Stage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Legislation in other places bans the practice of tail  docking outright or restricts it to certain breeds. Departmental officials  claimed that, in the case of the Animal Welfare Act 2006, which applies in England and Wales, the decision to restrict  tail docking to certain breeds was taken for political reasons and was not  based on scientific evidence. The Department should bear in mind that this  place, as well as being a legislative Assembly, is a political institution. If  we legislate based on political reasons now or in the future, the Department  should not be surprised.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To help us to inform our decision, I ask the Department to  provide the evidence that it has so far failed to produce. The Department  should explain why a lamb&rsquo;s tail or pig&rsquo;s tail can be docked, yet it seeks to  prohibit the docking of a working dog&rsquo;s tail. How is the pain associated with  the castration of an animal any different to or less severe than the docking of  a dog&rsquo;s tail?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department should not be totally reliant on the study  that was published today, &lsquo;Risk Factors for Tail Injuries in Dogs in Great Britain&rsquo;. That  study is inconclusive, and it suggests that, although the risk of tail injury  is rare, working dogs appear to be at greater risk than other dogs. To allow  further evaluation of the risk factors in specific groups, the study calls for  additional studies to focus on the high-risk groups, including working dogs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister will be pleased to note that I consider some  aspects of the Bill to be positive. It will introduce a number of offences  relating to the repulsive practice of animal fighting. All Members will agree  that such practices need to be stamped out. The Committee will, as normal,  scrutinise the punitive clauses. We will ensure that they are stringent enough  to guarantee the appropriate punishment of criminals and to act as a suitable  deterrent to those who participate in that heinous crime.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I started by saying that the Bill is important, and I hope  that my contribution has reinforced my point. The Committee for Agriculture and  Rural Development looks forward to receiving the Bill and taking it through  Committee Stage.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Irwin</strong>: I  welcome the opportunity to comment on this important legislation. As Members  are aware, the Bill is intended to update what is essentially a 40-year-old  piece of legislation. I said in a previous speech to the House that it is good  for Northern Ireland that we have devolved institutions through which we can  have a say in how legislation is shaped to ensure that it addresses the precise  needs of the Northern Ireland public. It is also good that we no longer have to  suffer the one-size-fits-all approach that was taken during direct rule.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee received a presentation from DARD officials  on the main points of the Bill. That raised a number of important questions  about a host of issues, such as tail docking, dogfighting and dog breeding. I  wish to deal with the effect of clause 8, particularly where dogs are  concerned. I am pleased that the Dogs (Amendment) Bill and the Welfare of  Animals Bill, which the Committee has not yet fully scrutinised, are proposing  to improve the law on the illegal practice of dogfighting. I welcome that it  will be an offence to be involved in dogfighting, regardless of whether  unnecessary suffering is caused.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I stated in the Second Stage debate on the Dogs (Amendment)  Bill that there is a disgraceful record of dogfighting in my constituency.  Indeed, that has been documented in a BBC &lsquo;Spotlight&rsquo; investigation. Everyone  is keen to see that sort of behaviour suitably legislated against to bring to  justice those who are involved in such a barbaric pursuit in any form, be it  providing a location, lifting money, or supplying or owning the animals that are  involved.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Part 2 of the Welfare of Animals Bill refers to the  promotion of good animal welfare. As a farmer, I know that animal welfare is a  key requirement of the industry, and I welcome the inclusion of important  clauses on that matter, especially after a number of incidents occurred in the  Newry and Armagh constituency recently when  animals starved to death and were caused unnecessary suffering.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the extension of powers in clause 11 to secure  the welfare of domestic animals. There have been a number of incidents where  people have accumulated high numbers of domestic animals in unsuitable  conditions, particularly in dwellings. When such cases are eventually  uncovered, they are particularly sad.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On the Committee&rsquo;s meeting on 22 June, I raised the issue  of tail docking on working dogs. I feel that the Committee will take the time  to discuss that in more detail, because I believe that tail docking is  acceptable and necessary in a number of legitimate situations. A number of  groups, particularly those from the shooting fraternity, have told me that they  are concerned that tail docking will be banned outright. I feel that it would  be foolish to legislate for an outright ban, especially considering the damage  that working dogs with a full tail can sustain. The evidence is clear: in  specific circumstances, tail docking is favourable for a dog&rsquo;s well-being. For  instance, a spaniel hunting in thick scrub benefits greatly from having a  docked tail, because it prevents the dog becoming caught in thorns and sustaining  open wounds in trying to free itself. That issue needs greater debate and  deliberation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Many more issues could be raised in the Chamber. However,  the Committee will have the opportunity in the near future to discuss the finer  details of the Bill, and I look forward to that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for bringing  forward the Bill to this stage. I, too, welcome the opportunity to speak at the  Second Stage of the Welfare of Animals Bill. As has been stated, the Bill  supersedes the 1972 Act and strengthens its powers. As has also been said, the  legislation is almost 40 years old, so it is about time that it was updated.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 17 is one of main elements of the Bill. It  authorises an inspector who finds a protected animal that is suffering to take  immediate steps to alleviate that animal&rsquo;s suffering. I am sure that we all  know of a number of cases where animals were neglected but nobody had the power  to step in and take control of the situation. The power that clause 17 provides  is important, because the public want to see immediate action being taken in  response to the neglect of animals.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Animal fighting is a barbaric sport, and I find it hard to  believe and hard to stomach that anyone could get satisfaction from watching  two dogs or two cockerels killing each other. I, therefore, welcome the  provision on animal fighting, which includes dogfighting and cockerel fighting.  I am sure that we have all seen examples of such fighting on the television,  YouTube and other IT facilities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is absolutely shocking to see that on the Internet. A  person will commit an offence if he or she causes a fight to take place;  receives money making or taking a bet; publicises a fight; keeps or trains an  animal for the purpose of fighting; or photographs or records an animal fight.  Authorised officers will be able to seize animals that are involved in fights.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Under the promotion of welfare and ensuring the welfare of  animals, it will be an offence not to take all reasonable steps to ensure an  animal&rsquo;s welfare. Animals&rsquo; needs will include protection from pain, suffering,  injury and disease; a suitable environment; and diet.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Under abandonment provisions, a person commits an offence  if, without reasonable excuse, he or she abandons an animal for which he or she  is responsible and fails to make provision for its welfare. The provision  includes the length of time for which an animal is left alone. There can be  unforeseen circumstances &mdash; for example, if someone is taken ill &mdash; so there has  to be a certain amount of leeway. However, people do leave animals in cars  during hot weather, and those animals become dehydrated and, in many cases,  die. Animals require food, water, shelter, warmth, light and ventilation. Those  are simple but important requirements for the welfare of animals.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister touched on the transfer of animals by way of  sale or prize to persons under the age of 16. When DARD representatives gave  evidence to the Committee on that issue, members had some concerns.  Agricultural shows and fetes are important ways for young people to learn about  husbandry skills, the welfare of animals and the rural way of life. A person under  the age of 16 can have an animal, but it must be under the supervision of an  adult. That is an important caveat.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Tom Elliott talked about the Bill allowing for subordinate  legislation on the licensing and registration of any activity that involves animals.  We need to be able to introduce fit-for-purpose legislation speedily at any  time, because it is an evolving world and things change. Therefore, we need  that flexibility.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We all, including professional breeders, agree that puppy  farms must be eradicated. In areas such as Loughbrickland and Katesbridge, pups  and bitches are being kept in terrible and appalling conditions where the only  thing that matters is greed and making as much money as possible. Never mind  the welfare or condition of the animals or whether those pets will survive, as  long as breeders get their money, they do not care. Puppy farms are a conveyor  belt system in which bitches are continually breeding.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>: I  am extremely worried. This is the second time in the month of June that I have  agreed with the honourable Member, an issue on which I will have to examine my  conscience.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, being serious, I agree absolutely with the Member  on the issue of puppy farming. Perhaps he has an insight into the Minister&rsquo;s  thinking that I do not have, because I am not quite certain where in the  legislation that puppy farming is specifically banned. Perhaps, therefore, he  or the Minister will indicate where it is banned. If it is not banned, I make  the absolute categorical assurance that I will table an amendment to ban puppy  farming. What goes on in those establishments is an utter disgrace. Female dogs  are used as nothing but breeding machines, puppy farms are often in damp barns  or byres at the back of farmyards, and the people involved are, sometimes, far  from wholesome.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Puppy farms are something that Northern Ireland  can do without, and I would be the first to say that we should banish them to  history.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.00 noon</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  I thank the Member for his intervention. I agree entirely with him. We will  scrutinise the issue in Committee.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Responsible dog breeders want regulation. When some of them  appeared before the Committee, they told Members that they deserved  recognition. They said that they wanted regulation and to be treated in the  same way as any other rural business. There is work to be done in Committee,  and I am sure that the Minister will address the issue in her response.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill provides powers to make subordinate legislation to  deal with certain issues, such as circuses. I know that the issue of banning  animals at circuses is close to Jim Wells&rsquo;s heart. The welfare of greyhounds in  racing and the use of electronic training devices are also covered. Those  issues will all be looked at, including at Committee Stage. It is important to  note that any subordinate legislation will have to come before the Committee  and that it will be subject to a full consultation process.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The docking of dogs&rsquo; tails is an emotive issue. Across the  water, opinion was divided. In Scotland,  there is a complete ban on tail docking, while, in England  and Wales,  there is a partial ban to allow for the docking of working dogs&rsquo; tails. The Royal Veterinary  College and the University of Bristol  recently published a report on tail injuries and docking. I have only just received  the report, so I have not had time to study it in detail. However, its summary  states that 281 tail injuries were recorded from a population of 138,212 dogs  attending 52 participating practices between March 2008 and March 2009. The  weighted risk of tail injuries was 0&middot;23%. Some 36% of injuries occurred in the  home; 17&middot;5% were outdoor-related; and 14&middot;4% were due to the tail being caught  in a door. In 16&middot;5% of cases, the cause of injury was unknown. The report also  says that greyhounds, lurchers, whippets and spaniels sustained most of the  main injuries, while injuries were not as prevalent in Labradors  or retrievers. A lot of information is available, and we could pick out  different scenarios. My point is that the tails of 500 puppies would have to be  cut to save one dog from having its tail damaged.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Account must be taken of other issues. For example,  greyhounds, lurchers and whippets need their tail for balance. Dogs use their  tail in a number of ways. They use it to communicate, so they will be compromised  by having their tail docked. They use it to convey fear, caution and  aggression. Some breeds even need to use their tail as a rudder when swimming,  while others need it for balance when running. It is not as simple as saying  that, if a dog is a working dog, it should be exempt from tail docking. We do  not even know how many working dogs there are. We do not have that data.  Moreover, there is a difference between a working dog that is used in a hunt  and a dog of a working breed that is kept in the house. How many puppies are we  talking about? A number of dogs could be working dogs: terriers, Alsatians,  Rottweilers, which were originally used as cattle drovers, and poodles, which  were used for catching ducks. Where do we stop? Where do we draw the line? I  look forward to the issue coming before the Committee and to scrutinising the  Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We need the all-island approach, particularly to the  barbaric sport of animal fighting.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I hear what the Member says about the all-island approach. However, we were  told some 18 months ago that the Republic of Ireland was well ahead of us in  that process. Would the Member care to tell us how far they have got? I believe  that, at that time, one of his party colleagues &mdash; it may have been Mr O&rsquo;Dowd &mdash;  indicated that the Republic of Ireland was perhaps only a month from  legislating. I have not heard of such legislation coming forward.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  I thank the Member for his intervention. I am not au fait with that. I know  that they are fast-tracking the Bill to catch up with ourselves. Perhaps the  Minister will clarify that point.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>:  The honourable Member mentions the all-island approach. There is some logic in  saying that, for cross-border activities such as dog fighting, it is important  that the rules on both sides of the border are equally stringent. However, the  Minister has always argued in correspondence with me that it was important that  we waited until the Irish Republic brought in its legislation so that the two  matched, as it were. Surely, the other way of doing it is for us to ensure that  our animal welfare legislation is some of the best in Europe and to say to our  colleagues in the Irish Republic, &ldquo;This is what we have; now you draft  something similar so that cross-border activities can be controlled&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  Again, I agree with the honourable gentleman. I see his point. It is important  to set the mark in all our legislation. Too often, we look to other  legislatures for guidance. I agree: set the legislation, and let the rest  follow. That is a fair point to make.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are regarded as being animal lovers on these islands.  Sadly, that is not the case. This legislation will give us the opportunity to  protect all animals and to bring pets and non-agricultural animals up to the  same standard as agricultural animals in Ireland. That has to be welcomed by  everybody. I look forward to the Committee&rsquo;s further scrutiny of the Bill, when  we will get an opportunity to look at all the fine detail and the points that  Mr Wells raised.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  Last Tuesday, 22 June 2010, DARD officials took the Committee through a wide  range of issues in relation to the Welfare of Animals Bill. It was an  informative and helpful meeting, and I thank the officials who attended.  However, as the Deputy Chairperson of the Committee said, there is still a long  way to go. A lot of work has to be done before we reach an acceptable animal  welfare Act.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We were told that the new Bill will update, strengthen and  improve the framework for animal welfare that was set out in the 1972 Act. It  aims to stop cruelty and prevent unnecessary suffering to any vertebrate animal  and to promote and enhance the welfare of all protected animals, including  domestic pets. It was made clear to the Committee that, within the definition  of the Bill, all farmed and non-farmed animals are automatically covered.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Every Member who has spoken so far has mentioned tail  docking. I will not dwell on the tail docking issue, because one week I will be  voting for it and the next week against. However, the lobbying on tail docking  is intense. Although we had good evidence earlier, further evidence is to come,  and we can only wait for that before we reach any conclusions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I sought clarity on a few points during the discussions  last week, and I wish to more or less repeat them now. First, I wish to deal  with the issue of individuals being disqualified from keeping animals. In  Committee, I referred to past cases in which individuals were disqualified from  keeping animals, only for them to find that there was a simple way out of that  situation. As a paper exercise, the animals could simply be transferred into  the name of a spouse or neighbour, when the same animals really remained in the  so-called care of the disqualified person. I was advised by the officials that  the Department had tried to extend the powers in clause 33 to prevent a  situation in which someone is disqualified and animals appear on the land two  days later.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 33 sets out clearly that the disqualified person is  disqualified from owning animals, keeping them, participating in keeping them  and being a party to someone else keeping them. The Department tried to sort  out that aspect of the problem. However, its powers are restricted by human  rights legislation. For example, if a husband is disqualified, his wife or  neighbour cannot be banned from keeping those same animals. People have human  rights and cannot be disqualified if they have not committed an offence. That  is the law, and we must accept it. However, more could be done to address the  legal loopholes left in the Bill. To leave such loopholes in a Bill is wrong,  and we must consider how to tighten the law further.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I must express my view on clause 53, which provides:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;anything which occurs in the normal course of hunting  or coursing&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">is not covered by the Bill unless:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the animal is released in an injured, mutilated or  exhausted condition&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I suggested that it might be proper to add the  words &ldquo;or hunted&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;released&rdquo; because, when an animal is being  hunted and is injured or exhausted, it is more prone to attack or being killed.  I was informed that the responsibility for hunting dogs does not rest with the  Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, and my understanding is that  no Department has been allocated that responsibility by the Executive. I stress  again that, in preparing the Bill, we should look at that. I accepted that on  the day that I was told it, but since then I have been thinking about it. Let  us forget about the hunting aspect. Surely it is possible in this Bill to deal  with cruelty directed towards an animal, whether hunted or not? As I have  stated, an animal in an exhausted condition is liable to attack or to be  killed. I once witnessed an exhausted stag being hunted to a standstill and  savagely attacked by the pursuing pack. Though it was a single incident, the  sight will remain with me forever. The poor animal had run for miles across the  countryside and could go no further; it had to submit to vicious attack.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the ongoing work on this Bill. However, there are  so many outstanding issues to be dealt with that I doubt that it will progress  as the Department or Minister expects. It will take much longer before all the  t&rsquo;s are crossed and the i&rsquo;s dotted.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I take this opportunity to thank the Minister for bringing the Bill to the  Assembly and for her introductory statement. I also thank the Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for his contribution. I have joined the DARD  Committee only recently, and I have a lot to learn. I see the Minister looking  at me; she wonders what I will throw at her, but she will hear it as we go  along.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Second Stage of the Welfare of Animals Bill.  Anything that the House does to ensure that animals &mdash; farmed or not, young or  old, big or small &mdash; do not suffer unnecessarily or, if possible, at all must be  welcomed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As has been said, our Committee listened to DARD officials  last week, and Members had the chance to question officials on the Bill. We were  given a good steer as to why the Bill was necessary. As I understand it, the  Bill makes it an offence for people responsible for animals to fail to take  reasonable steps to ensure their welfare. It prohibits the docking of dogs&rsquo;  tails. I must say that I cannot get my head around why anyone would want to  dock the tail of a dog. Perhaps, during the debate, someone will enlighten me.  This provision prohibits the practice and must be welcomed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill also prohibits the:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Transfer of animals by way of sale or prize to  persons under 16&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The Minister referred to that in her speech. It  also specifies that abandonment is an offence, whether or not the animal is  likely to suffer. It strengthens provisions relating to animals&rsquo; rights. We  welcome the fact that an inspector or police personnel may take into their  possession an animal that is suffering or is likely to suffer and that, on  conviction for certain specified offences, a person can be deprived of the  possession or ownership of an animal.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 3 clearly assigns responsibility to anyone who has  control of an animal, even temporarily. That includes veterinary surgeons  keeping animals in their surgery overnight.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 8 creates offences in relation to animal fighting.  The Minister and other Members also referred to that. That is very welcome.  Even wrestling and baiting are to be outlawed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My comrade Willie Clarke, who is not in the Chamber,  mentioned clause 17. That clause authorises inspectors and police officers to  take immediate steps if they find an animal suffering unnecessarily.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clauses 21 and 22 are also welcome. They allow that  seizures can be made if animals are being used for illegal purposes; indeed,  search and entry powers are also to be used to put an end to that cruelty. That  would apply to a number of cases that we have heard of this morning. Clause 31  sets stringent punishments for a large range of offences under the Bill. Surely  this should be a real deterrent to anyone ill treating any animal.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome and support the Bill. Everything must be done to  safeguard the welfare of animals. I look forward to the next stages of the Bill  and to its becoming law in the near future.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>:  This has been a good week for animal welfare in the Northern Ireland Assembly.  Many of us sat here until 11.00 pm last Tuesday debating the Wildlife and  Natural Environment Bill. At the end of that debate, the House took the  extremely encouraging decision to ban the barbaric sport of park hare coursing.  That took 28 years to achieve, and I for one went home with a spring in my step  and a smile on my face. At last, the days of Crebilly and Eglish are over, over  for good. I will take great delight tomorrow in writing to the Irish Coursing  Club in Clonmel in the Irish Republic to tell it the good news. It no longer  reigns on this part of the island of Ireland, and it can pack its bags and go.  I will have a grin on my face as I do that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Park hare coursing has been banned, which is great news. We  now have the introduction of this Bill, which is a step in the right direction.  I strongly welcome the Bill, but I also wish to raise a procedural issue. The  First Stage of the Bill occurred last week, and we are now at Second Stage, the  consideration of the principles of the Bill. I have to ask why there is such a  short time in which Members have a chance to read the Bill and consult in their  constituencies and with the various animal welfare organisations. That may not  be the fault of the Minister of Agriculture; it may be the fault of the  procedures of the House. However, I do not think that that is sufficient time.  This is the first view that those of us who are not on the Agriculture  Committee have had of the legislation. Frankly, I do not think that that is  good enough.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also hope that we do not reach the situation that we did  with the Wildlife and Natural Environment Bill &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  Now that there will be vacancies on the Agriculture Committee, the Member would  be more than welcome to join us.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>: I  would not wish to inflict myself on the good members of the Agriculture  Committee. The Health Committee has done its penance over the past year, and it  would be unfair to put me on the Agriculture Committee, as I would increase the  length of the meetings considerably.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Apart from that point, I think that the introduction of the  Bill is good news. It is also good news that, because of European legislation,  the welfare of farm animals in Northern Ireland has improved significantly over  the past decade. As a result of the EU&rsquo;s wise measures, we have, for instance, banned  veal crates. That was an appalling practice whereby animals were locked in  wooden crates where they could not turn or move and were kept in total darkness  for almost their entire life. They were fed milk when they craved food with  roughage in it, and they were then slaughtered for veal. You may ask why I am a  vegetarian; I think that veal crates alone, if they were still in action, would  convince anyone to be vegetarian. That was a disgusting practice. However, it  has been banned, and we now have a humane way of raising calves for veal that  few people could complain about.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister is right to stick to her guns. We are  outlawing battery cages for egg-laying birds on farms from 2012. We will have  an enhanced system of cages where hens can at least move and exhibit some form  of normal behaviour. I for one would not eat an egg produced under the battery  system. I am delighted to say that I have my own free-range hens, who are  perfectly happy and certainly do not live in battery cages.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are moving in the right direction; however, it is  important that we bring animal welfare standards for non-farm animals up to at  least those of animals kept on farms. Therefore, although this is a step in the  right direction, we have some way to go.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">First, the Bill concentrates too much on physical distress  and physical cruelty. It assumes that the only way an animal can be ill treated  is by cutting it, starving it or keeping it in insanitary conditions. I would  like to raise the issue of how guard dogs and some farm dogs are treated in  Northern Ireland. As part of my interest in wildlife, I regularly visit farms.  In my constituency, I also regularly visit industrial premises. Is it  acceptable that dogs which are intelligent are kept on a short lead of 6 ft or  8 ft for their entire life? Such dogs have no form of intelligent contact with  anything else and no form of exercise.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I dealt with a case when I was in Ballycastle a couple of  weeks ago, where I saw a dog that in my opinion was being &mdash; [Interruption.]  Sorry, I cannot compete with the honourable Members for Mid Ulster and Upper  Bann. That animal in Ballycastle had clearly been tethered to a chain about 6  ft long for its entire life and had never been released. OK, it was being fed  and watered and it may have had shelter, but what way is that to keep a dog? I  have a dog: Molly. She will be delighted to have her name in the Hansard  report. Molly is walked at least two or three times a day. Were she not given  that exercise, she would become extremely distressed. I believe that there is  merit in stipulating in the Bill or its regulations that every dog must be  exercised for half an hour a day. I think that that is entirely reasonable. A  dog needs and should get that stimulation. I have also seen sheepdogs not being  used during the sheep breeding season being locked up in hen houses or small  barns or being tethered for months on end without any exercise. That is  unacceptable, and I am seriously considering tabling an amendment later on.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the Minister I believe I have detected a personal  interest in the issue. I know her view on hare coursing, and I notice that she  did not turn up on Tuesday night to vote against hare coursing because she  would have been whipped by her party into voting a certain way. Without wishing  to make a party political point, that is good news, in so far as some Sinn F&eacute;in  Members may be developing a conscience about what they did on Tuesday night.  However, it was good that some of its Members, rather than be forced through  the Lobby in favour of park hare coursing, decided they had better things to  do. As a result of that, we had a great victory.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Puppy farming is another issue that I feel strongly about  and that is particularly relevant to my constituency. Unfortunately, South Down  is the heartland of this desperately evil activity. We in Northern Ireland can  do without puppy farming. Dog breeding establishments in which numerous bitches  are kept and intensively bred, often in appalling conditions, simply for their  puppies to be sold on should be banned. I cannot see how Northern Ireland would  become a poorer place if we were to ban puppy farming full stop. Frankly, the  goings-on in establishments in South Down and Mid Ulster are ghastly. Bitches  are kept in darkened hen houses, never seeing the light of day. They are kept  in a perpetual state of pregnancy, breeding large litters of pups which are  quickly taken from them and sold before the bitches are made pregnant again for  further breeding purposes. Now, will someone in this House tell me why we  should not ban puppy farming? Will the Minister tell us whether there is  anything in the Bill that will enable the Department to step in to stop this  awful abuse? Puppy farming is often ancillary to the activities of the few  individuals responsible, some of whom are unsavoury characters for other  reasons. I do not think that the ordinary man on the street in Northern Ireland  would care if puppy farming were to be banned for ever.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am also concerned about circuses. A distinction can be  made in relation to the use of horses, dogs or domesticated animals in  circuses. A horse may be perfectly used to being transported around the country  for showjumping or three-day eventing. Therefore, their use in circuses is not  a huge step forward from that. I could live with domestic animals being used in  circuses. However, I have enormous problems with animals such as elephants,  tigers and lions being taken from their native habitat, kept in cramped  conditions and used in performances. In real life &mdash; I have been to national  parks in Kenya and South Africa &mdash; a lion would range over several hundred  square miles in its lifetime. How can we justify such an animal being put into  a cage, let out only for performances and, in my opinion, treated in a totally  unsatisfactory way? Lions do not normally exhibit the behaviour that is seen in  circuses. If it is wrong for lions, it is totally wrong for elephants, which  are very large animals that are kept in cramped conditions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Rather than leering at animals in a circus as they perform  unnatural acts, we should try to enhance people&rsquo;s perception of wildlife.  Again, I do not see why it would be wrong for the Assembly to follow the lead  of many county and city councils throughout the United Kingdom and, indeed, the  Irish Republic, which have decided that there will be no circus performances  involving wild animals in their area. That does not mean that I am a killjoy.  There can still be a huge range of acrobats, clowns and so on who are the norm  in circuses. Indeed, some of the world&rsquo;s greatest circuses, such as the Chinese  and Russian state circuses, do not have any animals, yet they are packed out as  they tour the world. Therefore, I ask the Minister to give serious  consideration to a ban on the exhibition or use of wild animals in circuses,  which would go a long way towards improving animal welfare standards in  Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I shall now raise an issue that some people may think is  slightly offbeat. I shall raise it anyway because I have received letters about  it from constituents and people throughout Northern Ireland: namely, the  treatment of lobsters. Members may wonder why on earth the Member for South  Down is raising the issue of the treatment of lobsters. I have a slight problem  with any culinary practice that involves boiling an animal alive before serving  it up to be eaten. Members can call me odd, offbeat or strange, but, first, I  would never eat it, and, secondly, there must be a more humane way to kill a  lobster before eating it. To me, throwing a lobster into a tub of boiling  water, which sometimes happens to crabs and other crustaceans as well, is  extremely cruel. I am trying to tease out of the Minister whether there is  anything in the regulations that would allow that practice to be altered. I  understand that animal welfare organisations in the UK have devised electronic  means to kill lobsters which could be used to allow them to be eaten without  difficulty.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That said, the legislation is very much a step in the right  direction, and, with amendment, we can have strong laws on how we treat  animals. The ordinary man in the street is very much on our side, and I do not  think that anything that I suggest would have a radical economic impact. A few  people might lose out, but the vast majority of people would be unaffected  because the vast majority of people in Northern Ireland treat their animals  extremely well. One thing that I love about coming up to Stormont in the  morning is seeing all the dogs being exercised in the grounds. They are some of  the best treated and probably some of the poshest dogs in Northern Ireland. No  other Parliament in the world would dream of allowing people to walk dogs in  its grounds. People would not be allowed within 500 yards of another  Parliament&rsquo;s buildings, but we have an open estate in which people can exercise  their animals, which are extremely well kept. Therefore, for 99% of dog and pet  owners in Northern Ireland, the legislation will not apply, and they have  absolutely nothing to worry about. However, the 1% or 2% of people who bring  pet keeping into disrepute do need to be worried.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Other aspects of the Bill are fine. The possibility of a  USPCA, council or police inspector moving in to seize an animal when there is  every likelihood that suffering will occur is good news. I also welcome clause  9, which deals with the five freedoms. That clause replicates the equivalent  legislation in GB, which has been a considerable success. The Minister has  wisely taken some of the best aspects of GB legislation, and she has consulted  our colleagues in the Irish Republic about measures that they are introducing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My view on cross-border co-operation is thus: if I find  that my wife is having a very friendly relationship with a very handsome man  who lives next door, I consider the issue. If I find that she is having that  relationship so that they can more effectively manage the hedge that separates  our two properties, I am happy. If I find that the relationship is based on  anything more sinister, I start to get worried. However, I assure Members that,  in my wife&rsquo;s case, the relationship is simply about the hedge. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Equally, if cross-border co-operation &mdash; Northern Ireland  being a self-governing part of the United Kingdom and the Irish Republic being  an independent, free-standing state &mdash; is based on what we can do to manage  issues of mutual concern, I am behind it 100%. I have no difficulty whatsoever  with that type of co-operation. If the Minister is liaising closely with her  colleagues in the Republic to ensure that the two jurisdictions on the island  of Ireland have the best possible animal welfare legislation, that is good news  for all concerned and I am behind her 100%.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Something is going on &mdash; notes are being given with great  flurry to the Minister. I must be saying something heretical &mdash; there is nothing  new there.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If that is what is being done, it is good news because  there is most definitely a cross-border element to animal welfare. We do not  want a situation in Northern Ireland in which our legislation is some of the  best in Europe and those who wish to abuse animals simply hoof it across the  border and commit their nasty deeds in the 26 counties of the Irish Republic.  Equally, we do not want a situation in which our legislation is weaker than  that in the Republic and people come up here to carry out particularly  distasteful acts.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On balance, the legislation is good. However, let us look  at the psychological abuse of animals. It is absolutely vital that we look at  circuses, and let us ban puppy farming forever.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>:  As someone who has been on the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development  from the very start, I say to the Member for Strangford that we are very  careful about whom we ask on to the Committee. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Second Stage of the Bill. However, it is not  unfair to say that it has been a long time coming. In repeated Assembly  questions, the Minister insisted that she would hold up this Bill to have  compatible animal welfare legislation on both sides of the border. However, the  Department watered down that argument as time went on. Finally, we have arrived  at the Bill&rsquo;s Second Stage today, which I welcome. It is long overdue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The legislation that the Bill will replace was brought  through by my former party leader Harry West in 1972. At that time, it was seen  as adequate and it was very much better than the 1911 legislation that it  replaced. However, this Bill provides further protections that are necessary.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Two years ago, an open farm was raided and the scene was  horrifying. Dozens of dead animals were found rotting and dozens more live  animals showed signs of real neglect. It was widely reported that this new  legislation was needed to help to fight that sort of animal cruelty. On the  back of that scandal, my party brought a motion to the House that called for  action. I am sorry that that has taken 18 months, but we are glad to see that  the legislation is here at last.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill allows authorities to take action if the condition  of an animal is likely to cause it to suffer. We have been waiting for that for  quite a while, and it is absolutely necessary. Sadly, it will not prevent  animal cruelty, but it will prevent some animals from suffering if their  conditions can be assessed on time. Clause 9 refers to what are known as the  five freedoms of animal welfare, and I welcome their inclusion. This brings  Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the UK and enshrines in law the  responsibilities of owners of animals.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are some contentious aspects of the Bill, one of  which relates to enforcement. Powers of entry are available when animals are in  distress. In certain circumstances, that is a necessary provision, but some  stakeholders are concerned about who will be provided with that power. It is  important that the Department, like the Bill, ensures that the appointment of  inspectors is left to councils and that those councils make adequate provision  for inspections by their officials.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is vital that the state retains those powers of entry.  That means that inspectors that are appointed under the powers of the Bill must  be employed and have their role overseen by councils or the Department. Other  citizens should exercise their duty to be vigilant to instances of welfare  abuse. However, it is dangerous when people other than government officers are  given powers of entry and seizure.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that those matters and other contentious issues can  be ironed out quickly in the Bill&rsquo;s Committee Stage, because we all know that  legislative time is short. I hope that disagreements can be resolved so that  the protections in the Bill that are vital to animal welfare can become law  before next summer.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  I congratulate the Committee and the Minister on the excellent work that they  have done in producing the Bill, which contains many matters that we should all  admire. I want to raise one or two matters. I am not going to go into great  detail about all the things that are good about the Bill, but I have some  concerns.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">During last week&rsquo;s debate on the Wildlife and Natural  Environment Bill, I spoke about the need to balance the rural and the urban.  Through this Bill, we need to balance animal welfare and the rural way of life,  as well as farming businesses. I find it slightly perplexing that the Bill is  coming from the Agriculture Committee. However, the more I think about it, the  more I admire the Committee for all the work that has gone into the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Anyone who travels round the world will see that some  countries over-regulate. I will sound a note of caution, however, because I  feel that, with such lengthy Bills, we must be careful to think through what we  are doing. We must also be careful that we do not have too many rules and we  set good frameworks. Too many rules lead to the need for enforcement, and with  that comes the need to employ people to do the enforcing. As we have just  heard, that adds another cost to councils. We need to find a way to do it so  that the costs are kept low.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to touch on one or two matters, especially the  docking of dogs&rsquo; tails. If I may add a little bit of humour before I go into  details, I should say that I think that there is nothing nicer than having your  dog welcome you home. I read an article a few years ago that gave 15 reasons  why a dog is better than a wife. Those reasons included that a dog is always  pleased to see you, which goes back to the tail wagging; it welcomes you home  whatever state you are in; and it does not cost as much to keep. There was,  however, a very good reply later explaining why a cat is better than a husband.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, if I may return to the point, I do not fully  understand why docking tails is necessary. I am sorry that Mr Elliott is not  here to hear about this, but I worked on a farm many years ago, and I remember  the docking of lambs&rsquo; tails. Every year, I saw the lambs with runny bottoms,  looking ill and uncomfortable. Each year, we quite happily stood with a bucket  of Dettol and a lamb between our legs as we sliced off its tail. I remember  thinking that it must have been painful. Legislation, quite rightly, changed  that practice, and we then used a rubber band or a similar technical method.  However, it all seemed very strange when, a few months later, we were eating  the same beast.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I wonder whether it is necessary to dock tails. I know that  the debate relates to working dogs, but it also involves country dogs. We have  schnauzers at home, and most schnauzers have docked tails, although we had one  that did not have its tail docked. After picking up burrs and thorns during its  walks with me through the woods, it would spend most of its life having those  burrs and thorns removed. It used to take ages, cause the dog much pain, and,  occasionally, I would have my hand bitten by my dog as I tried to clean the  burrs from its tail. Therefore, it is necessary to have tails docked, and we  should just find the right way to do it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At a later date, I would like clarification on clause 7,  which deals with poisons and who judges what is given to or put into an animal.  I remember an Olympic Games a few years ago when Peter Elliott ran after having  an injection that was illegal for horses, but legal for humans. When it comes  to setting the regulations, we must ensure that we are thorough and get it correct  for animals and humans.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 8 deals with animal fights. I am totally against any  form of ghastly animal fighting, whether it is cockfighting or the awful dog  fighting that occurs illegally in Northern Ireland, and I long to see strong  punishment for those who organise those activities. However, when we consider  the wording of the Bill, which states that the legislation still applies even  if both animals are wild animals and that an animal is protected if:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;it is under the control of man&hellip;on a permanent or  temporary basis&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">it gets more vague. Taking a simpler example, when  an owner walks their dog in the countryside without a lead, is that animal  under control? Most would feel that it is, but it really depends on how strong  the owner&rsquo;s voice is.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If we continue down that line, I am concerned that the Bill  may serve as a back door to the banning of hunting. Hunting dogs are not wild;  they are kept in cages and are well looked after by the hunting fraternity.  They are bred to chase hares or foxes, and we heard last week, during the  debate on the Wildlife and Natural Environment Bill, how much damage foxes do  and that some 600 foxes were caught in Glenwhirry. I want the Minister to think  that provision through and, perhaps, specifically to exclude hunting. We are  going down a line that is the thin end of the wedge. That is very dangerous and  may take away some of the great enjoyment of those in the countryside who ride  to hounds.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is much more in the Bill on which the Minister and  her Department should be congratulated. However, I am wary of the cost involved  in implementing its provisions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 19 refers to the owner of the animal or another  person with a &ldquo;sufficient interest&rdquo; being consulted when it comes to  controlling or putting down an animal. Lawyers will love that, because it is  difficult to define what a &ldquo;sufficient interest&rdquo; is. That also needs to be  thought through.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am very sad that Mr Wells is no longer in the Chamber.  Listening to him earlier, it seemed that he had never been told that it was  rude to gloat, such was his enjoyment of his victory on hare coursing last  week. Mr Wells was absolutely correct in his comments about puppy farming, but  I would love to know how he would tell the difference between puppy farming and  dog breeding.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to finish by once again congratulating the Minister  on the Bill, because there is so much in it to be praised. However, there are a  few issues that will cause great concern and one or two things that could be  used in different ways. That said, it is good Bill, and I will certainly be  supporting it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a LeasCheann  Comhairle. I am grateful for Members&rsquo; contributions to the debate, which have  been valuable and informative. Many of the Members who spoke are no longer  here, but I will still respond to their points. I will also carefully read the  Hansard report of the debate and write to individual Members if necessary.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for Agriculture and  Rural Development raised a number of points. He began his contribution by  saying that the Bill was empty and had nothing in it. Given the learning  process that we have all been through during the past three years, I would have  thought that the Deputy Chairperson would understand that the purpose of  primary legislation is to provide an overarching legal basis on issues and to  provide for the introduction of subordinate legislation as necessary.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I explained during my opening remarks, the key  principles are set out in the Bill, but the Department needs flexibility to  react to new scientific evidence that may necessitate changes to legislation.  Similar provisions for farmed animals are contained in the Welfare of Animals  Act 1972, and the Bill will allow the Department to react to new European  regulations and implement them in the North of Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The EU will continue to put forward regulations for farmed  animals as scientific evidence develops, and we need the ability to implement  those. However, the EU is also turning its attention to domestic pets. Again,  we need the ability to react, and those regulation powers will enable us to do  that.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The purpose of subordinate legislation is to provide  detailed legal provisions on issues that are not already covered in primary  legislation. Subordinate legislation may require frequent change, the process  of which is much quicker than that of primary legislation. By providing  regulation powers in the Bill, my Department will be able to consider the need  for subordinate legislation for specific establishments or activities on a  case-by-case basis. Subordinate legislation provides the flexibility to  introduce detailed requirements that are specific to the activity that involves  animals. I am sure that Members will appreciate that that cannot all be covered  on the face of the Bill. Otherwise, we would have a huge Bill with hundreds of  clauses. More importantly, there would be no flexibility to make changes in the  future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Consultation with relevant stakeholders is paramount, and  it will be undertaken to ensure that any regulations are proportionate and  workable. I have listened to stakeholders who have concerns over welfare issues  relating to dog-breeding establishments, open farms, wild animals in travelling  circuses, primates being kept as pets and greyhound tracks, to name but a few.  The powers in clauses 11, 12 and 13 provide the power to regulate those  activities, to license or register them, or to ban them if the evidence is  there to support doing so. Obviously, the Agriculture and Rural Development  Committee&rsquo;s detailed scrutiny will also ensure the appropriateness and  proportionality of any subordinate legislation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members said that they were keen to get the primary  legislation through in the lifetime of this Assembly. Indeed, Mr Wells made the  point that we had the First Stage last week and the Second Stage this week. The  reason for that is to allow the Committee to do a lot of work on the Bill over  the summer and to enable it to scrutinise it in detail. If we had put Second  Stage back, we would have lost our time in this period of the Assembly and  restricted the Committee&rsquo;s ability to scrutinise the Bill properly. That is why  Second Stage has come so soon after First Stage. A number of Members also  raised points about the Wildlife and Natural Environment Bill. Many aspects  that were raised today are covered in that Bill, and I am content for the  Environment Minister to take those forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will now go through the detailed aspects of Members&rsquo;  questions, one of which concerned primates. The Welfare of Animals Bill  provides the primary power to make regulations to prohibit the keeping of  certain types of animals at domestic or other premises. The powers in the Bill  do not extend to dangerous wild animals within the meaning of the Department of  the Environment&rsquo;s Dangerous Wild Animals Order 2004. Therefore, the Bill only  covers primates that are not classified as dangerous wild animals. There is quite  a bit of detail in that, but, as Mr Elliott is not in his seat, I will not go  through it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Quite a few Members spoke about wild animals in circuses.  The Bill provides a range of powers to deal with them. For example, powers will  be available to regulate their use under clause 11, to license the circus under  clause 12, or to ban their use under clause 13. Although the 2006 consultation  asked some basic questions on the general use of animals in travelling  circuses, it was not issued to any circuses or representative bodies of  circuses. However, my officials met representatives of the European Circus  Association. They were totally opposed to a ban on the use of wild animals in  circuses but in favour of regulation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will now take time to consider the evidence and what is  best for wild animals in circuses. We also need to consider what would happen  to the animals if they stopped performing. I certainly do not want those  animals to be destroyed, and, therefore, I want further input from  stakeholders. Once all the evidence is available, I will, if necessary, issue a  further consultation that sets out specific proposals on the future use of wild  animals in circuses. A point was made about liaising with our counterparts in  the South. The actions that I take will have to take account of the fact that  many circuses in Ireland  that have wild animals for use are based in the South.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Elliott raised the issue of progeny. The powers in the  Welfare of Animals Bill cover all animals once they are born. However, a provision  is included to extend the powers in clause 11 to secure the welfare of progeny  as well as the parent animal through regulations that govern animal breeding  should future scientific evidence show that it is necessary.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Quite a few Members raised the issue of tail docking, on  which people have strong views one way or the other. Recent research by the Royal Veterinary  College and the University of Bristol  on tail docking confirms that, overall, the risk of tail injuries to dogs is  small. Generally, dogs have a 0&middot;23% risk of tail injury. Willie Clarke cited  that figure, and it means that 500 dogs would have to have their tails docked  to protect one dog. In a year, that would mean about 10 dogs in the North being  protected. The risk of a tail injury to working gun dogs, while slightly  higher, is still extremely low at 0&middot;29%.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The report concludes, therefore, that, among ordinary dogs,  500 puppies would have to be docked to prevent one tail injury in later life  and that, among working dogs, 345 puppies would have to be docked to prevent  one tail injury in later life. Although information on the number of working  dogs in the North is limited, the available information suggests that about  5,000 working gun dogs are born here every year. Tail docking every dog would save  10 dogs from injury and three from an injury requiring amputation. The evidence  suggests that there is no justification for allowing the tail docking of  working dogs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We looked at best practice in other places. Our  counterparts in Scotland  believe that there is no justification for changing the legislation there,  which bans the tail docking of all dogs, to allow the tail docking of working  dogs. The question that follows on from that is: if we are not happy with  docking the tails of dogs, why is the practice of docking the tails of lambs  and piglets still in place? The proposal to ban tail docking for all dogs is  consistent with separate legislation that allows for the docking of pigs&rsquo; and  lambs&rsquo; tails. Tail docking in lambs and pigs should not be routinely carried  out. It should take place only where there are clear husbandry needs in a herd  or flock.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The same rationale cannot be applied to the argument for  docking dogs&rsquo; tails. Although it is argued that some tails are docked to  prevent injury &mdash; for example, to working dogs &mdash; it is far more widespread and  is a far more common practice that tails are docked on certain breeds purely  for cosmetic reasons. Animals should not be docked for reasons other than  welfare and, in this case, the evidence supports what is proposed in the  legislation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Dog-breeding establishments, which Jim Wells, Willie Clarke  and others raised, caused some discussion. Earlier this month, when the  Assembly discussed the Dogs (Amendment) Bill, the issue of dog-breeding  establishments was raised. I will use the powers in the Bill to regulate and  license dog-breeding establishments to improve standards in them and to assist  legitimate local breeders in marketing their dogs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a huge difference between a legitimate breeder and  a puppy farmer. I have met breeders who are anxious to ensure that their  businesses are regulated and that the checks and balances are in place to  enable them to carry out their work. I differentiate between those who apply  good husbandry, breeding and welfare standards and who rear dogs as a  legitimate business and those who breed dogs in a hayshed or a chicken house in  very poor conditions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Canine Breeders of Ireland fully support proposals for  legislation on dog-breeding establishments, and substandard breeders will have  to improve their standards or they will not be licensed. I will want to discuss  with stakeholders the regulations that will be brought forward in subordinate  legislation. It is to everyone&rsquo;s benefit to include the regulations in  subordinate legislation, where we will have the flexibility to change them as  necessary.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">P J Bradley made the point that, in the past, people who  were disqualified from keeping animals continued to have access to them. To  ensure that a disqualified person does not remain in control of an animal or  animals, the Bill proposes to extend the scope of disqualification. That will  cover any activity whereby a person can be party to an arrangement under which  he or she is entitled to control or influence the way in which animals are  kept. Such activities include owning an animal; keeping, arranging for or  participating in the keeping of an animal; dealing in animals; and transporting  or arranging for the transport of animals. A person who breaches a  disqualification order will be guilty of an offence. The penalty for breaching  a disqualification notice is up to six months&rsquo; imprisonment and a fine of up to  level 5 on the standard scale, which is about &pound;5,000. Although we need to be  mindful of human rights, I take Mr Bradley&rsquo;s point that people are getting  round the rules.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Elliott, Mr Wells and Willie Clarke mentioned the  progress that DAFF has made with its Bill and how that impacts on us. I assure  the House that DAFF continues to work on that, but it is not at an advanced a stage.  At one point, DAFF was ahead of us, but it had to postpone its work. We keep in  close contact with the South. I met Minister Smith to discuss our respective  Bills, and our officials continue to be in close contact.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Wells, who is not in his seat, talked about the  arrangements for hedge cutting. I hope that he will not trim his hedge, or let  his wife do so, during the nesting season. I hardly need to remind Mr Wells  about that. He also asked what the Department is doing about owners who cause  unnecessary physical or mental suffering to animals. He made a point about  guard dogs and said that such animals do not receive proper stimulation. That  will be an offence under the Bill, whether it happens by omission or positive  action. Anyone who permits another person to cause unnecessary suffering will  also commit an offence. Mr Wells is familiar with the five freedoms that will  be extended to companion animals.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Wells made a point about lobsters. Invertebrate animals  are excluded from the Bill because, at present, insufficient scientific  evidence exists to prove that invertebrates feel pain. It is known that  invertebrates do not have a central nervous system to transmit or to process  the intensity of pain, and, therefore, it is believed that invertebrates are  capable of only a stimulus-response reaction. However, should future scientific  evidence indicate that invertebrates are capable of experiencing pain and  suffering, the Bill includes a provision that will allow its scope to be  expanded accordingly. I asked my officials those questions because we want the  Bill &mdash; the previous one was almost 40 years old &mdash; to last for a considerable  period. Furthermore, we want to ensure that the Bill enables us to bring new  scientific evidence to bear in the future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members brought up the role of the USPCA. There will  be no change to the role of the USPCA under the Bill. The USPCA is an  independent charity, and nothing in the Bill affects that. The Department will  continue to work closely with the USPCA and all other agencies, such as the  PSNI, the Environment and Heritage Service, Revenue and Customs and local  councils on the welfare of animals.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">George Savage asked who will enforce the Bill when it  becomes law. Many of the existing powers of enforcement will remain in place.  The Veterinary Service will continue to appoint inspectors to implement and to  enforce powers that relate to farmed animals on agricultural land. The  Veterinary Service will have new powers to seize farmed animals that are  suffering or are likely to suffer. The Bill will enhance and extend the  existing powers of enforcement by making new powers available to district  councils to appoint inspectors to implement and to enforce provisions on  non-farmed animals, including powers to seize non-farmed animals that are  suffering or are likely to suffer. District councils will undertake the  licensing and registration functions that are currently undertaken by the  Veterinary Service for pet shops, animal boarding establishments, riding  establishments and zoos. They will also be responsible for any new licensing  and registration functions that are introduced via subordinate legislation.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">1.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The PSNI will provide support as necessary for DARD and  district council inspectors and will lead on welfare issues involving organised  animal fighting or where other criminal activities are involved. Following  guidance from the Department, district councils will be able to appoint  inspectors from existing resources or by new appointment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Danny Kinahan raised the point about hunting or fishing. I  can clarify that the Bill does not impact on anything that occurs in the normal  course of hunting, coursing or fishing. I have gone through most of the issues,  but I will keep an eye on the Hansard report to see what I need to follow up on  after the debate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank Members for their contributions to the debate and  for the questions and issues that they have raised. To conclude, I am confident  that the powers in the Bill will keep us at the forefront in our protection of  farmed and non-farmed animals and improve animal welfare standards in the North  of Ireland. My officials and I look forward to working closely with the Agriculture  and Rural Development Committee as it now begins its detailed scrutiny of the  Bill, which I have no doubt will prove to be very valuable. I am aware that the  Committee has not yet decided to what date it will extend the Committee Stage  for the Bill. If it is extended to no later than the week commencing 29  November, that should ensure that sufficient time remains for the Bill to  complete its progress through the Assembly and for Royal Assent to be obtained  before the Assembly rises. I commend the Bill to the House. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith  agat.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Notice taken that 10 Members were not present.</p>

    <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="f"></a>Transport Bill: Second Stage</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development (Mr Murphy)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That the Second Stage of the Transport Bill [NIA  29/09] be agreed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The aim of the public transport reform programme is to  create efficient, effective and sustainable public transport services that  contribute to the Executive&rsquo;s transportation, environmental, social inclusion  and equality objectives, while supporting the development of the wider economy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A major public consultation exercise and continued  engagement with key stakeholders and the transport community and business  sectors have served to underpin and significantly inform the proposals. The  Transport Bill will provide new arrangements for the delivery of public  transport services in the North. It is more than 40 years since the last major  change in legislation. The law needs to change now to keep pace with the  requirements of a modern public transport system.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Under the Transport Act 1967, the Department of the  Environment was responsible for granting road service licences for the carriage  of passengers and their luggage by road; that licence included both an operator  element and a route element. Under reform proposals, the Department for  Regional Development will take over responsibility for the route element of the  licence and the Department of the Environment will retain responsibility for  bus-operator licensing as well as its other licensing responsibilities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill introduces a duty on my Department to secure the  provision of public transport services with due regard to economy, efficiency  and safety of operation. It provides the framework for the Department to do so  through a new contracting regime supplemented by a service permit system. The  new contracting regime and permit system will allow the Department to enter  into agreements with operators for the provision of public passenger transport  services, enable the continual regulation of the market and, as I already  stated, allow the Department to comply with EC regulation 1370/2007.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I should explain that the EC regulation requires that where  a public service obligation exists in respect of the provision of public  passenger transport services by road or rail, a public service contract must be  awarded. The regulation allows for that contract to be awarded directly to an  internal operator, such as Translink, or to be competitively tendered. I have  ruled out the privatisation of public transport now or in the future; it is,  therefore, intended that Translink will continue to deliver most public  transport services through a directly awarded contract.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The proposed contracting powers will also allow the  Department to award contracts for services that are not included in the  directly awarded contract on a competitively tendered basis. It will be open  for all operators, including Translink, to bid for those contracts. For  example, contracting powers will allow the Department to take forward the  Executive&rsquo;s objective of introducing Belfast  rapid transit and of awarding that contract on a competitively tendered basis.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The contracting regime will be complemented by a  service-permit system to allow operators to apply to my Department for a permit  to run public transport services that are not already being provided in the  contracted network. That will facilitate innovation by operators and enable  them to propose new services and allow the public transport market to grow.  Northern Ireland Railways will remain the sole provider of railway services.  Its statutory duty under the Transport Act 1967 will remain.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill contains offences and enforcement powers to allow  my Department to enforce the regulated public transport system effectively.  Under the Bill, the Department will have the power to determine the general  level and structure of fares for all contracted services and for services that  operate under a service permit where fuel duty rebate or concessionary fares  are paid. The Bill contains powers for the Department to provide vehicles,  information systems and technology and will allow for the introduction of  on-street ticketing and integrated ticketing systems. It also contains powers  for the Department to acquire and dispose of land where that is necessary for  public transport purposes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The legislation will allow the Department to exploit  commercial opportunities arising as a result of its functions that relate to  public transport. That power could be used to generate revenue from the sale of  advertising, for example, at rapid-transport halts. The Bill amends the  statutory role of the Consumer Council and requires it to publish a forward  work programme in respect of its public transport functions. It also puts in  place arrangements for co-operation and exchange of information between the  Department and the Consumer Council.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill amends and updates grant-making powers on the  provision of passenger transport services. The Department has power under  article 6 of the Transport Order 1977 to pay grants to the Northern Ireland  Transport Holding Company towards capital expenditure for the purchase of  vehicles to be used for the provision of stage-carriage services. The Bill will  allow grants to be paid to any eligible person for the purchase of vehicles for  the provision of public passenger transport services.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Under section 75A of the Transport Act 1967, the Department  has power to make grants towards expenditure that is incurred in facilitating  travel by members of the public who are disabled. The Transport Bill will  extend that power to include two additional sections of the community: elderly  people and those who live in rural areas. The Department provides funding to  the Community Transport Association, which offers training, advice and  information to its members. To date, the Department has relied on annual budget  legislation for those payments. The Bill will introduce a power to allow the  Department to fund transport advisory bodies and, therefore, to continue the  funding of the Community Transport Association.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill will also introduce a power to make regulations in  respect of conduct in bus stations; in railway premises a power already exists  to make by-laws to regulate conduct. Such a power would bring bus stations into  line with railway premises, allowing effective enforcement against misconduct  to improve passenger and staff safety.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Under the Bill, the Department will be able to direct that  bus stations be made available for use by other specified service providers;  that will allow operators who have been granted a permit or who receive grant  aid to gain access to bus stations. In such circumstances as the Department  determines, the aim is to improve service to public transport users.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill will also clarify the Department&rsquo;s powers in  relation to appointments and terminations to the Northern Ireland Transport  Holding Company.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, the enactment of the legislation will ensure  the provision of a high-quality, integrated public transport system that will  put greater focus on delivering efficient, affordable services that are  responsive to local customer needs.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Regional Development (Miss McIlveen)</strong>: As  Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for Regional Development, I welcome the  opportunity to speak at the Second Stage of the Transport Bill. The issue  before the House is whether the Assembly is content to endorse the principles  of the Transport Bill. The Bill, as introduced, makes provisions relating to  public passenger transport and ancillary services, and for connected purposes.  It is a substantial Bill, with 50 clauses and two schedules, and it allows the  Department a substantial amount of delegated powers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the Minister has indicated, the Bill makes provision for  powers relating to the regulation of public transport service delivery in Northern Ireland.  It covers the duty of the Department to secure the provision of public passenger  transport services by rail and by road; the power to enter into agreements and  to award service permits for that purpose; the ability to attach conditions to,  and to vary, service permits, along with powers for the revocation, suspension  and curtailment of service permits. The Bill creates offences and provides  enforcement powers in respect of the contracting service permit regime. It also  provides powers for the Department to regulate fares; designate bus stations or  premises as shared facilities; regulate passenger conduct in bus premises;  provide for integrated and on-street ticketing systems; make grants for the  provision of bus services of benefit to certain sections of the public; acquire  and dispose of land; provide vehicles and facilities for public transport  purposes; and exploit commercial opportunities arising from its public  transport functions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At its meeting on 23 June 2010, the Committee for Regional  Development considered the Bill and was broadly content with its principles.  The Committee took evidence from the Department for Regional Development,  Translink, the Federation of Passenger Transport and the Consumer Council  during the pre-legislative stage of the development of the Bill. During those  sessions, the following issues, among others, were explored: access to public  facilities for private sector operators; and the meaning of &ldquo;most&rdquo; in clause  1(3). That clause states:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Department must, subject to subsection (1) and  Regulation (EC) No. 1370/2007, secure that most public passenger transport  services continue to be provided by the Holding Company and its subsidiaries.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Northern Ireland Transport Holding Company is the  holding company, and its subsidiaries are the Translink companies.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The availability of data to underpin an understanding of  the full costs and benefits, outside those identified in the explanatory and  financial memorandum to the Bill, were also explored during the Committee  sessions. With regard to that issue, the Committee has received an assurance  from the Department that the additional work with Translink arising from the  gaps in data identified and recommended in the outline business case would be  completed and made available to the Committee during the Bill&rsquo;s Committee  Stage. The Committee looks forward to receiving the Bill and exploring those  and any other issues that arise in evidence during the Committee Stage, and it  is broadly content with the principles of the Transport Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will speak now in my capacity as a Member and refer to a  few aspects of the Bill that I feel need to be considered carefully by the  Committee. I welcome the aim of the Bill in relation to seeking compliance with  EC regulation 1370/2007, which came into effect in December 2009. That  regulation on public transport services by rail and by road repeals earlier  Council regulations 1191/1961 and 1107/1970. Although I am not an expert, my  understanding of that regulation is that it introduces standardised  European-wide rules on the procurement and funding of contracts for public  transport services and introduces more competition into public transport,  particularly in states relying on state involvement, the award of exclusive  rights or direct awards of contracts without competition. That has particular  impact in Northern Ireland,  given the public funding of public transport services.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As a result of that regulation, it is incumbent upon the  Department to show that it is not overcompensating in the award of contracts.  It seeks to ensure that there is as much regulated competition as possible in  public transport delivery and that that is as transparent as possible. However,  I understand that, although not explicitly stated in the Bill, it is intended  that the achievement of that be contemplated through the agency model. It is  vital that in scrutinising the Bill, the Committee considers carefully whether  the agency model is the best method to achieve greater transparency and value  for money in practice.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We will have to determine whether creating another  arm&rsquo;s-length body will allow for adequate scrutiny of how public money is spent  in the public transport sector.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">1.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">While there is limited scope for competition in the market  at present, I welcome the potential opportunities for competition to arise in  public transport provision in Northern    Ireland under clause 4 of the Bill. This  allows the Department to authorise the provision of services that are  supplementary or complementary to services that are already in place. That will  not just give the public transport network the capability to grow, but encourage  innovation in a sector that can be replicated across that sector.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am mindful of the effect that competition has had on  services, for example, from Belfast to Dublin Airport,  in frequency, fares and provision of services, specifically overnight services,  which also had a knock-on effect on the frequency and fares of the service from  Belfast to Belfast International Airport. I will, however, be keen to ascertain  in the Committee how the Department will seek either to limit or promote that  aspect of the Bill in practice. Consumers in Northern Ireland have suffered for  some considerable time from a lack of competition in public transport services  and, while the provisions in the Bill do not permit direct competition, I hope  that the Department does not stifle innovation and entrepreneurship by  interpreting clause 4 too narrowly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill proposes a raft of offences and powers of entry in  relation to the service permit system, which will also have to be scrutinised  carefully by the Committee. Clause 1(3) states:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Department must &hellip; secure that most public  passenger transport services continue to be provided by the Holding Company and  its subsidiaries.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will be interested to hear during Committee Stage what  the word &ldquo;most&rdquo; will actually mean in the context of regulation EC 1370/2007  and how that equates with the requirement in clause 1(1) that the Department  should have:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;due regard to economy, efficiency and safety of  operation.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In particular, I will also be keen to see how the  Department will ensure improved value for money for customers. As I said  earlier while speaking as Deputy Chairperson of the Regional Development  Committee, there were substantial gaps in the data that were identified and  recommended in the outline business case. Those gaps will need to be filled and  acceptable answers given in that regard. Obviously, I have deep concerns that  we will have to wait until Committee Stage to consider that information, rather  than prior to this stage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill also provides the Department with the contracting  powers that it requires to secure the provision of public passenger transport  services, including rapid transport and integrated ticketing systems. The Bill  is a particularly permissive piece of legislation, and not simply in that area.  It will be important for the members of the Committee to satisfy themselves  that such wide, permissive powers are appropriate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In general, I welcome the wider principles of the Bill. I  look forward to the opportunity for closer scrutiny that Committee Stage allows  in order to address those issues that may give some concern at first glance.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Leonard</strong>:  There are many general principles in the Bill that we should welcome, such as  the move towards integrated ticketing. The by-laws and provisions for  misconduct in bus stations are important, bringing that into parity with other  locations. People need to feel safe as they go to stations to embark on  journeys, finish journeys or whatever. That is an important issue for the  general public and is one of those things that can attract people to use public  transport.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is good provision for stations to garner economic  benefits. We all know how tight budgets are, and it will be interesting to see  how the practicalities of that will flow from the legislation and practice to follow.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Obviously, I welcome strongly the Minister&rsquo;s remarks about  ruling out privatisation. We know of many examples around the world where  privatisation has led to a fragmentation of services, whereby the ripe parts of  the service are bought up to make fortunes, leaving the less ripe parts to  others and creating unequal service provision. The Minister&rsquo;s statement makes  that situation clear.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Then there is the whole idea of where we go with some of  the provisions of the Bill, and there are a couple of issues at this point that  it would be interesting to hear from the Minister on, today perhaps or even at  Committee Stage. The Bill sets out how public transport services are to be  provided, and it refers to economy and efficiency.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">We need to look at possible fragmentation, although  I am sure that that is not the Minister&rsquo;s intention; we have to be wary that  those more or less profitable areas do not come out of the system. I know that,  to balance that, there is a provision for grant-making powers. I will be interested  to hear from the Minister, as he highlighted rural areas in his remarks, that  rural provision will be equal to urban provision, that there will be  connectivity, and that a service will be provided. The intention is that  grant-making powers will provide for the elderly as well as the disabled.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In that meeting point of economy and efficiency of public  transport services, the grant-making powers to service rural areas and the idea  of community transport, it will be interesting to see how we roll out the practicalities  and equality of provision across the board. Those are the main areas of  principle that we will have to explore, but in general we welcome the Bill and  will work hard at its Committee Stage. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  I too am very pleased to speak on the Second Stage of the Transport Bill,  especially since its general principles aim at creating an effective, efficient  and sustainable public transport system with its new service delivery  arrangements. I note that there was a good consultation, with 103 written  replies and 11 public meetings attended by 194 people. I sometimes wonder  whether we should look at our consultation system from time to time. The public  service agreement (PSA) target is for 77 million journeys to be undertaken by public  transport, but we sound out only a very small number of people. Consultation is  vital, but perhaps a better way of doing it would reach more people.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the agency idea outlined in the Bill; it brings  independence and the freedom for the Minister to direct and choose a publicly  owned company. Can we please include the Committee in that? Some Committees  work well with their Ministers; others have less contact. The Committee for  Regional Development does pretty well, but this is a plea that we be always  kept as part of the system.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We want more people to use public transport, we want it  more available, we want it to represent value for money and we want it  integrated. We will see some of that coming through in the Bill. However, I am  sometimes concerned about whether anyone has actually sat down and planned the  long-term layout of our transport, because that is the basis of everything that  we are trying to do and what we are trying to fit in on the back of the Bill.  Integrated ticketing is welcome, but our use of roads means that we will not  hit our carbon emission targets for 2025.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That is what law should be about: making things easier for  the public and giving them more and better services. I welcome the Bill&rsquo;s  powers to enter into agreements, award permits, create offences and give more  enforcement powers; I also welcome the power to regulate fares, and,  particularly, the power to cause shared facilities, the absence of which is  holding us back. I also welcome on-street ticketing and the grants for the  provision of bus services to benefit certain sections of the public. I am sure  that there is a mass of people in Northern Ireland hoping for sorely  needed community transport.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a need for rural transport and, of course, care  and medical transport. There are many other areas in which Departments over 10  or 15 years have decided that transport is not their responsibility. It is our  job, and we must ensure that we get the transport system working for everyone  and reaching out to everyone.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the fact that the Bill provides for competition.  Somewhere there is a balance between a state-owned system and a privatised one  with many owners.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That has worked around the world in many different ways,  and the Bill gives us a chance, through the agency, to explore both systems. I  welcome the Bill, and I hope that we get there. I look forward to being part of  the Committee Stage, when we will put our heads together to try to find ways of  delivering a better transport system.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  As a Member of the Regional Development Committee, I welcome the opportunity to  speak in the debate. I agree with the general principles of the Bill, although  I am sure that there will be much debate at Committee Stage on particular  aspects. As the Minister is aware, I am particularly interested in public transport  and its development. I, therefore, wish to see the Bill make a good legislative  base for providing public transport in all its forms.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Translink staff deserve praise for the proactive manner in  which they have overseen public transport to date. The Bill seeks to aid them  in continuing that approach into the future. The one topic that I am pleased to  see included in the Bill is the provision of integrated ticketing and new ways  in which that will be accessible for passengers. The Bill provides for the  future direction of public transport and ensures that the vulnerable in society  will continue to be supported. The powers of enforcement in relation to  passenger conduct will help to ensure that public investment in facilities and  equipment is protected through sound legal regulation. I look forward to  exploring all those issues in Committee, and I support the progress of the Bill  at this stage.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: A LeasCheann Comhairle, I thank the Members who  commented in the debate on the Bill&rsquo;s Second Stage. I am a bit surprised that  there were a limited number of contributions on what is a significant Transport  Bill. However, perhaps that is because Members were relatively satisfied with  the discussions that were held in Committee. Nonetheless, I am grateful to  those Members who contributed. They raised a number of points to which I will  now respond as best as I can. My officials and I will study the Hansard report  and will endeavour to respond to any issues that I miss out or do not manage to  pick up on.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Deputy Chairperson&rsquo;s comments that the  Committee is broadly content with the Bill. Of course, it will now have the  opportunity to apply a much greater degree of scrutiny in Committee Stage and  will be able to tease out certain issues, such as the use of bus stations. For  example, the Committee may discuss and take evidence on the generally held view  that people who wish to avail themselves of other coaches offering public  transport in Belfast  should not have to queue for them outside a hotel that is around the corner  from the Europa bus station, which is paid for out of the public purse. If we  address the issues in relation to that, such as who has control and authority  over that service, we can make better use of public transport facilities and  encourage a much broader uptake of public transport, which is the objective of  the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Another issue that will be teased out during discussions in  Committee Stage is the level of services that Translink will retain. The  percentage of public transport services currently run by Translink is in the  mid-nineties, and I do not envisage that changing very significantly. However,  the system that we will set up will ensure that there is proper scrutiny of  that. Miss McIlveen, when speaking as a private Member rather than as Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee, raised an issue about scrutiny and described the  agency as an arm&rsquo;s-length body. However, the agency will not be such a body. It  will be part of the Department and will be directly responsible to me. I do not  think that the work of private operators will lead to a significant change in  the level of provision that Translink provides. However, the agency will ensure  that the Department gets value for money from the public funding that it  supplies and that customers get an efficient and effective transport service.  Of course, Translink already provides such a service, but, as with every  system, that can be improved, and the agency will help to make those  improvements.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Deputy Chairperson is correct about the fact that the  issue has been driven by EC regulation, with which we are attempting to comply.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">1.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Billy Leonard raised the issue of fragmentation of the  service and competition from private providers. In Britain, a number of years back,  deregulation of the service was completed to allow private operators to  compete. That proved to be a negative experience. Here, we have urban areas in  which some routes would be commercially viable. However, we also have a large  dispersed rural population, and routes in rural areas would not be profitable  for private operators. Therefore, we want to ensure that we continue to provide  a public service, which is, essentially, the purpose of public transport, and  that we do not go down the route of deregulation, which would allow, as Billy  Leonard said, for fragmentation in the provision of public transport. We do not  want to deregulate public transport in any case, and our particular  geographical circumstances reinforce our view that deregulation is not the way  to go.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Billy Leonard and George Robinson raised the issue of  integrated ticketing as a means of ensuring a better and more accessible  transport system. As I said, this is the first major legislation in more than  40 years. The purpose behind it is to achieve a more clearly defined system of  public transport, not only for ourselves in attempting to regulate and operate  it but for members of the public whom we want to use it. To ensure that people  will avail themselves of the system, we must make it as accessible,  comfortable, reliable and efficient as possible.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Danny Kinahan raised the issue of carbon emission targets.  If we do not up the usage of public transport, as opposed to the private car,  we will struggle to meet the Programme for Government targets. The purpose of  the legislation is to regulate and improve public transport. However, the  general sense is that issues such as integrated ticketing, more information for  travellers and better facilities will increase the public&rsquo;s understanding of  how to use public transport and will lead, therefore, to an increase in the  number of people who use it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Billy Leonard also raised the issue of grant-making powers.  As I said in my opening remarks, grants, particularly for rural community  transport, were previously based on their inclusion in the annual budget. The  legislation specifically provides for funding for community transport, which  will be welcomed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Danny Kinahan talked about a long-term plan for transport,  which is, of course, the intention behind the Bill. That is why we are creating  an agency that will allow for a strategic approach to regulate public transport  and make it more understandable and accountable. The agency will also make  other public transport providers that are not necessarily linked to Translink  more comprehensible to the general public. It will give some strategic  direction to developing and enhancing that transport to ensure that more people  use it. Other features, such as the rapid transit system will also come on  board. The objectives of the Bill are to provide to the general public a  clearer sense of how public transport works, to make it easier to access and to  run, to extract the maximum efficiency and effectiveness from the system and to  allow for longer-term strategic planning through an agency that will be within  the remit of the Department.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I look forward to continued engagement with the Committee  and Members as the Bill progresses. The Committee will undertake detailed  clause-by-clause scrutiny. I will ensure that my officials and I continue to be  available, if required, for discussions with the Committee.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Danny Kinahan made a point about the breadth of  consultation. We tried to make the consultation process as inclusive as  possible, and there was a fairly good response to it. However, if, during  scrutiny, the Committee considers that gaps exist in the responses to the  consultation, it is at liberty to invite whomever it wishes to give evidence to  assist it in its deliberations. The fairly decent consultation that took place  on the Bill will strengthen its provisions. I look forward to further dealings  with the Committee as the Bill progresses.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That the Second Stage of the Transport Bill [NIA 29/09] be  agreed.</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="g"></a>Tourism (Amendment) Bill: Second Stage</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment (Mrs Foster)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That the Second Stage of the Tourism (Amendment) Bill  [NIA 30/09] be agreed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It will be helpful to Members if I begin by outlining the  background to this short Bill. The Tourism (Amendment) Bill is intended to  amend the Tourism (Northern Ireland)  Order 1992, which provides the Northern Ireland Tourist Board with the powers  to encourage the development of the tourism industry in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The amendments proposed in the Bill fall under three main  headings. The first proposes a change in the frequency of the Northern Ireland  Tourist Board&rsquo;s statutory inspections of tourist accommodation. The second  proposes a change in the mechanism for appointing the chairperson of the board.  The third provides for the transfer of tourist accommodation grants from Invest  Northern Ireland  to the Northern Ireland Tourist Board. Members might find it useful if I  summarise the policy rationale for each change before providing a brief summary  of the clauses.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As regards the frequency of certification inspections, a  key aim of the Bill is to update Part IV of the 1992 Order, which deals with  the regulation of tourist accommodation in Northern Ireland, commonly known as  certification. Northern Ireland  is unique in the United    Kingdom in having a statutory certification  regime for tourist accommodation. We have operated such a scheme since 1948.  Indeed, until the introduction of the Tourism Order in 1992, certification was  so wide that it included coffee shops and chip shops. The 1992 Order narrowed  the board&rsquo;s certification role, which now focuses solely on establishments that  offer overnight tourist accommodation: hotels, guest houses, self-catering  facilities and so on.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In practice, certification of tourist accommodation means  that tourists are guaranteed a minimum standard of accommodation when they stay  in Northern Ireland.  The system provides tourists with the reassurance that their choice of  accommodation has been inspected and approved by the board. Tourists, therefore,  know that, if they are disappointed with what they find or feel that the  accommodation does not meet acceptable standards, they can complain directly to  the Tourist Board. The board takes such issues extremely seriously, as  standards have a strong bearing on the quality of the visitor experience and it  is important that those standards are upheld. The Tourist Board will invariably  look into any complaint that it receives and take action, if appropriate. A  tourist in England, Scotland or Wales who is in similar  circumstances does not have the same means of redress.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The mandatory certification system, which is fully  supported by tourist accommodation providers throughout Northern Ireland,  is complemented by a voluntary classification and grading scheme, which is also  administered by the board and awards the familiar stars according to the  standard of accommodation provided. Although certification guarantees a minimum  standard of accommodation, the classification scheme seeks to encourage higher  standards of quality. No changes to the voluntary classification and grading  scheme are proposed in the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I turn now to the changes that are proposed in the Bill.  Under the current legislation, the Northern Ireland Tourist Board is required  to carry out an annual statutory inspection of each tourist accommodation  establishment. Therefore, every hotel, guest house, bed and breakfast,  self-catering enterprise or hostel is inspected by Tourist Board inspectors  every year. Those inspections focus primarily on the physical attributes of the  establishment, the size and number of rooms, catering facilities and so on. As  Members will appreciate, in most cases, those physical features change very  little from year to year. Therefore, my Department, in consultation with the  Tourist Board, has concluded that it would be appropriate to move away from the  current system of annual statutory inspections in favour of inspections once  every four years. That will clearly reduce the burden on proprietors and on the  Tourist Board.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to note that it is not intended that  establishments should be ignored and left to their own devices between  statutory inspections. Rather, to help to ensure that establishments continue  to comply with the minimum standards required by the legislation, the Bill will  require them to provide an annual self-review &mdash; in effect, self-assessment  statements &mdash; to the board. That will enable the board to operate an  arm&rsquo;s-length regulatory regime in between statutory inspections. The board will  still retain the power that it currently enjoys under the 1992 Order to carry  out ad hoc inspections as required &mdash; for example, in response to a complaint.  That is an important safeguard that is maintained in the legislation. The  proposed reduction in the frequency of inspections is fully justified and does  not risk any dropping of standards in tourist accommodation in Northern Ireland.  It is a sensible move to reduce the regulatory burden on accommodation  providers and will result in an overall saving in fees paid by such providers  to the Northern Ireland Tourist Board. That is particularly important in  today&rsquo;s challenging economic climate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I turn now to the part of the Bill that will change the  mechanism for appointing the chairperson of the Tourist Board. The Tourism (Northern Ireland) Order 1992 requires the  chairperson to be appointed by the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment from amongst  board members. That means that members must first be appointed to the board.  Therefore, the position cannot be directly advertised with the aim of  appointing a chairperson directly to the board.That is not to say that members  of the board would not be qualified to assume the responsibilities of the  chairperson. On the contrary, under the changes set out in the Bill, members of  the board will be as eligible as anyone else to apply for the post. The change  means that, when the next vacancy arises, the pool of candidates for the post  of chairperson will be much wider by virtue of no longer being restricted to  the eight or nine members of the board. The Bill will, therefore, permit the  chairperson of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board to be directly appointed by  the Minister via external open competition.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I emphasise that the change that I propose to the mechanism  for appointing the chairperson in no way reflects on the integrity of any of  the chairpersons of the board, nor on the process followed in making that  appointment. It is essentially an updating exercise to ensure that our  procedures are consistent with best practice as set out by the Commissioner for  Public Appointments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I turn now to responsibility for tourist accomm&shy;odation  grants. The recent independent review of economic policy report presented an  opportunity to expand the scope of the Bill. Members may recall that, in  December 2008, I commissioned Professor Richard Barnett to undertake the IREP,  the overarching aim of which was to assess DETI and Invest Northern Ireland policy  to determine whether it was sufficient to help to deliver the productivity goal  in the Programme for Government. One recommendation was:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Invest NI should transfer its budgets relating to  tourism accommodation back to DETI to be redistributed to a more appropriate  body&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">It is important to note that that recommendation is  in no way a criticism of Invest NI&rsquo;s role in grant-assisting tourist  accommodation but recognises that grant-assisting tourist accommodation is  misaligned with Invest NI&rsquo;s mission to increase business productivity. Having  considered the IREP recommendation, I decided to make provision for the  transfer of responsibility for tourist accommodation grants from Invest  Northern Ireland  to the Northern Ireland Tourist Board. Including such a provision in the Bill  is appropriate because a key statutory function of the NITB is the encouragement  of tourism in Northern    Ireland. It will play a key role in the  implementation of the new tourism strategy for Northern Ireland, which will set a  vision for tourism until 2020, and already has a statutory power to provide  grant assistance for non-accommodation tourism projects.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although the Bill will make provision for the Tourist Board  to grant-assist tourist accommodation, I have not yet decided a date for the  transfer of that function from Invest Northern Ireland. My officials are giving  full consideration to the issues associated with tourist accommodation grants  and will report to me in due course.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The changes proposed in the Bill were the subject of two  consultation exercises. A full public consultation on the changes to statutory  inspections and the mechanism for appointing the chairperson of the board took  place between 6 July 2009 and 2 October 2009. That was preceded by external  informal consultation with key stakeholders, such as the Northern Ireland  Hotels Federation. The public consultation did not throw up anything to justify  a change in policy.The transfer of responsibility for tourist accommodation  grants from Invest NI was included in the public consultation on the IREP  proposals, which ended in November 2009. The majority of consultees were in  favour of that proposal.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">1.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill is relatively short. It comprises six clauses and  one schedule. Clauses 1 to 3 relate to the statutory inspection process and, in  particular, to the change in the frequency of statutory inspections of tourist  accommodation to once every four years. They also relate to the statutory  review process that will operate in the years between statutory inspections.  Clause 4 permits the Northern Ireland Tourist Board to grant-assist tourist  accommodation. Clause 5 amends schedule 1 to the Tourism (Northern Ireland)  Order 1992 so that the DETI Minister is no longer required to appoint the  chairman from members of the board, and clause 6 allows the Department to bring  the various clauses into operation on a day or days to be appointed by  commencement. Schedule 1 provides for the transfer of certain assets and  liabilities from Invest Northern Ireland to the Northern Ireland  Tourist Board where tourist accommodation grants are concerned.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To summarise, I consider that the changes that the Bill  will introduce are necessary, wholly appropriate and proportionate and that  each represents a positive step forward in tourism.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment (Mr A Maginness)</strong>: I welcome the Tourism (Amendment)  Bill and the opportunity to contribute to the debate on it. In essence, the  Bill will bring about sensible and reasonable changes. It contains provision  for changes in the frequency of statutory inspection and reviews of tourist  accommodation. It also provides for the appointment of the chairperson of the  Northern Ireland Tourist Board and for financial assistance to provide or to  improve tourist accommodation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee first considered the Department&rsquo;s policy  proposals on the frequency of statutory inspection of tourist accommodation  during the prelegislative scrutiny. The Committee had concerns at that time  that suddenly changing the period between statutory inspections from one year  to four years may have an adverse effect on accommodation standards in the  intervening period. For that reason, the Committee suggested to the Department  that the time between statutory inspections should be determined through  secondary legislation, rather than be embedded in the primary legislation. The  effect of that is that the period may be changed more easily, should it be  decided at some future date that four years is too long between statutory  inspections.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is right and proper that the Committee impressed that  view on the Department and the Minister. There is always the risk that  standards could drop if statutory inspections were too long in coming about. I  am happy to say that, having taken the Committee&rsquo;s suggestion to take legal  advice, the Department agreed to include the time period between statutory  inspections in secondary legislation. I thank the Minister for taking on board  the Committee&rsquo;s suggestion, because it is an example of good co-operation  between a Committee, a Department and a Minister. The Minister considered our  position carefully and accommodated it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee was also keen to see provision for ad hoc  inspections between statutory inspections. That is also included in the Bill.  Committee members noted that the Bill provides for statutory reviews between  statutory inspections that the Northern Ireland Tourist Board can instigate.  The effect of increasing the time between inspections is to remove too  burdensome a duty on proprietors of accommodation. It is important that we try  to lessen the statutory burden on people in the tourist industry. That is to be  welcomed. Individual establishments will also be able to review themselves.  That is important, because it creates a new discipline for the proprietors of  accommodation. The Committee wants to hear the views of other key stakeholders  on those provisions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is proposed that the chairperson of the Northern Ireland  Tourist Board be directly appointed by the Minister through external open  competition. That is consistent with guidance from the Office of the  Commissioner for Public Appointments and with mechanisms used elsewhere in the  public service. That seems to be a reasonable and sensible provision in the  Bill, and the Committee supports it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The provision to allow the Northern Ireland Tourist Board  to grant-assist tourist accommodation provides for the transfer of certain  assets and liabilities from Invest Northern Ireland to the Northern Ireland  Tourist Board. The proposal is a result of a recommendation in the independent  review of economic policy that was carried out under Professor Barnett. Again,  that is a sensible and reasonable provision that has the Committee&rsquo;s support.  However, as the provision was not part of the Department&rsquo;s public consultation  on the Bill, the Committee wishes to fully scrutinise the independent review of  economic policy&rsquo;s consultation responses relating to that recommendation. We  will also wish to hear the views of key stakeholders on the matter. The  Committee is supportive of that provision, although we await the views of  others, which may be different. It must be accepted that the Tourist Board has  a duty and a right in some circumstances to provide grants for  non-accommodation facilities. In circumstances where the Tourist Board already  exercises that power, it is right and reasonable that it should be transferred.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee generally supports the principle of the  Tourism (Amendment) Bill and will further consider the proposals in the autumn.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Frew</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her thorough explanation. I welcome the change in the  annual statutory inspections of accommodation establishments, as that would  allow businesses to concentrate on exactly that: their businesses and the  service that they provide. I welcome the right of the NITB to carry out ad hoc  inspections. That would help to concentrate resources and attention on  accommodation establishments that might be causing problems and would allow the  time and resources of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board to be freed up.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Taking responsibility for tourist accommodation grants from  Invest NI and placing it with NITB could have merit, not because it would be a  slight on Invest NI but because it would keep everything much neater, bring  everything into one box and cut bureaucracy and red tape. It would mean that  the businesses and the individuals running them would know that they only have  to go to one body. It would also mean that the Northern Ireland Tourist Board  would have more control, as it would play a key role in the implementation of  the new tourist strategy for Northern    Ireland, which is vital for the growth of  that industry.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Is the Minister of the opinion that the Northern Ireland  Tourist Board is up to that challenge and can deliver on the outworkings and  provisions of the Bill? Can it deliver on the needs of our tourist industry?  Can it promote Northern    Ireland in the way in which it should be  promoted? There have been certain failures over the past years in my  constituency of North Antrim, one small example being that the Tourist Board  has only recently recognised that Slemish   Mountain exists. Will the  Minister detail how much grant funding Invest NI has offered to tourist  accommodation businesses in recent years and, in particular, how much support  the bed and breakfast and guest house sector has received?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  I welcome and support the Bill and its objectives. The Bill provides for  statutory inspections of tourist accommodation to be changed from annual to  every four years. The inspection regime benefits the tourist industry and  accommodation providers in Northern    Ireland by providing a uniform rating  system, in order that visitors know exactly what they will get in any given  establishment. That makes it much easier for accommodation providers to target  their marketing and prices. As a result, it is right that the industry should  pay for those inspections. Downgrading the inspections will remove three  quarters of the cost of inspections to business and lighten the regulation  load, which I very much welcome.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The provision that the Tourist Board retains the right to  conduct spot checks is also welcome, in that it will ensure that, should a  complaint be received, the board can check that the rating given at the  previous routine inspection remains accurate. Yesterday, as part of a question  to the Minister, I raised the concern of one or two Americans who complained  about our personal services, and the Minister answered. However, a good  feedback system should be considered as part of the inspection provided for in  the Bill, so that we do not rely just on those who use accommodation. We somehow  forget that users of tourist accommodation are not us; they tend to be  visitors. Therefore, it is essential to get some feedback, but we also need our  own feedback. I do not want to slight those who do an extremely good job, but I  have spoken to other people since my comment yesterday and I have heard exactly  the same thing: sometimes, our personal service is not as good as it could be.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic" align="center" style="text-align:center;">(Mr Deputy  Speaker [Mr Dallat] in the Chair)</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill also provides the Minister with the power to  appoint a chairperson of the Tourist Board directly rather than from board  members, of whom one is appointed. On the face of it, that is a minor and  technical alteration, but it allows for greater professionalisation of the  role. Currently, it would not be possible to advertise the chairmanship of the  board, only board membership. It may well be that the wider competition does  not attract the best candidates for the position of chairperson. An open, external  contest for the position will provide greater competition, thus ensuring that  we get the best person for the job. Yet, as the Minister said, we must not see  this as a slight on those who have held the post in the past or today, all of  whom have been excellent. Given the work that must be done to improve our  tourist industry, the change is welcome.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill transfers responsibility for the provision of  tourist accommodation grants from Invest Northern Ireland to the Tourist Board. It  stands to reason that the board is the best body to make such decisions. The  Tourist Board&rsquo;s greater knowledge of the tourism industry, the gaps in  provision and the existing development opportunities puts it in a better  position to give those grants. However, I seek some assurance that the relevant  expertise in the administration and distribution of grants will be available in  the Tourist Board.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is good that the House finally has the opportunity to  see what the Minister is doing on tourism. As with so many Departments, DETI  has taken a long time to come forward with its legislative programme. As a  result, we have seen a legislative logjam. Our tourism industry lags behind its  potential. The Bill is a step towards providing the Tourist Board and the  tourism industry with the tools that they need to make progress. I look forward  to seeing more enabling legislation on tourism from the Department that will  loosen regulation and improve governance and other matters.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm<span class="SectionMarker"><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: I am grateful to those Members who took time to consider the  Bill. I am also pleased to note the broad support for the Bill, which, although  relatively short, will result in some significant changes. Those changes will  be positive, proportionate and, as the Chairperson said, reasonable.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The reduction in the frequency of tourist accommodation  inspections has been welcomed by the tourist accommodation sector. The Bill  will lessen the statutory burden on the sector, taking a little bit of the  regulatory and financial pressure off, which is the point that Mr Kinahan made.  I was surprised to hear that the cost per room &mdash; albeit the rate that was set  in 1992 &mdash; is in the region of &pound;16 a year. Even though the maximum fee is &pound;1,500  a year, for a large hotel, it is quite a lot of money to pay the Tourist Board  every year, and I am sure that it could be used in other ways. Therefore, I am  sure that the industry will welcome the better regulatory proposals.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The appointment of the chairperson of the Tourist Board has  been welcomed, and the appointment process was in line with that stipulated by  the Commissioner for Public Appointments for Northern Ireland, who welcomes the  change. No controversy surrounds the appointment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The shift of responsibility for awarding tourist accommodation  grants from Invest Northern Ireland to the Northern Ireland Tourist Board is  part of moving tourism grant-making facilities into a one-stop shop so that  people get a more holistic view of tourism grants in Northern Ireland. My  friend Mr Frew asked whether the Northern Ireland Tourist Board is up to the  challenge. I have yet to set the commencement date for the transfer, and,  before doing so, I will ensure that it is up to the challenge. He also asked  how much money Invest NI paid out in grants in the past five years. The tourist  accommodation sector received &pound;11&middot;4 million of capital assistance, by far the  greatest proportion of which went to hotel accommodation, although I will write  to the Member in response to his specific question.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The introduction of spot checks has also been welcomed. As  I said in my opening comments, there is no comparable system in the rest of the  United Kingdom, and we should be proud of the fact that a tourist who is  dissatisfied with the standard of their accommodation can complain to the  Northern Ireland Tourist Board, which will take their comments on board and go  out to look at the accommodation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not think that the Northern Ireland Tourist Board  website has a feedback facility, which is a point that Mr Kinahan made about  service delivery. The Bill is concerned with minimum standards of the physical  attributes of accommodation; nevertheless, the Member&rsquo;s point about service  standards in tourist facilities is well made. We all know about websites such  as TripAdvisor that allow people to record what they feel about their tourist  experience. At present, there is no such facility on the NITB website, but  perhaps the board should look at including a facility for people to record how  they felt about their visit to Northern    Ireland and their experience of  accommodation or, indeed, another facility. That is something that we might be  able to take forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased that the legislation has been welcomed. I note  Mr Kinahan&rsquo;s comments about bringing forward more legislation, but it is not  always necessary to legislate to promote the tourist industry. The industry has  been working very hard with me to develop the tourism strategy and with the  Tourist Board and Tourism Ireland  to drive forward the industry here. Great strides have been made in the past  two or three years, and I commend the industry for what it does, day and daily,  despite the difficult times that it has to face. Legislation is not always  necessary. Nevertheless, I am grateful to the Members who contributed to this helpful  debate on the Tourism (Amendment) Bill, and I look forward to engaging with the  Chairperson and the Committee as it progresses.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That the Second Stage of the Tourism (Amendment) Bill [NIA  30/09] be agreed.</p>

    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;(8A) Answers may be no longer than two minutes.  Answers to supplementary questions may be no longer than one minute.&rdquo; &mdash; [The  Chairperson of the Committee on Procedures (Lord Browne).]</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Today, Members are asked to consider seven motions to amend  Standing Orders. Amendments (a) to (e) permit Monday sittings to continue after  7.00 pm. As Members know, under current arrangements, Monday sittings must  finish by 7.00 pm unless there is a motion on the Order Paper to suspend  Standing Orders 10(2) and 10(4). Usually, that procedure works satisfactorily,  but, occasionally, there is insufficient advance information to allow a motion  to suspend Standing Orders to be placed on the Order Paper. As a result, there  have been several occasions during this session when business could not be  taken because the sitting would have gone beyond 7.00 pm. For example, there  have been oral ministerial statements, questions for urgent oral answer,  matters of the day, items of business such as legislation, which is not time  bound, or a series of Divisions, all of which may consume more time than  expected.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If a motion to suspend Standing Orders is to be on the  Order Paper, it must be tabled by the previous Tuesday at the latest, when the  probable length of the sitting may not be known. As a result, when a sitting  continues until 7.00 pm, outstanding items of business have to be rescheduled  by the Business Committee. That is very frustrating for parties and for Members  who have carried out all the research to inform their speeches and may have  invited interested parties to attend the debate or informed the media that the  topic will be debated.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To remedy that problem, the amendments to Standing Orders  10 and 12 allow a member of the Executive, in relation to Executive Committee  business, or a member of the Business Committee, in relation to all other  business, to table a motion on the day to extend the sitting to a time  specified in the motion. The motion to extend must be notified to the Speaker  in writing, normally by 11.00 am that morning or at a later time agreed by the  Speaker. In agreeing to a time after 11.00 am, the Speaker will take into  account matters such as the impact on timings of any emergency or business that  could not have been foreseen earlier, such as urgent ministerial statements.  The Speaker has discretion over whether the time stated in the motion is  reasonable, and his decision will be notified as quickly as possible. Standing  Order 12(7) has been amended to provide that the motion to extend cannot be amended  and will not be debated. The Standing Orders outline what the provisions are,  and the Speaker will detail the procedural and practical arrangements that will  apply through a Speaker&rsquo;s ruling.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is general agreement that the Assembly should be a family-friendly  organisation, and I wish to emphasis that, normally, Monday sittings will  continue after 7.00 pm only if there is a motion on the Order Paper. That  acknowledges the Business Committee&rsquo;s responsibility for arranging the business  of the Assembly, and it assures that Members, their staff and others can plan  in advance around their other commitments. The amendments provide a facility to  extend the sitting only in exceptional circumstances that could not have been  anticipated and when the impact of not continuing the sitting would be  significant.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment (f) to Standing Orders relates to Question Time,  which takes place on Mondays from 2.30 pm to 3.30 pm and on Tuesdays from 3.00  pm to 3.30 pm. The amendment provides that Question Time will be for one hour  from 2.30 pm on both days. Since the Justice Minister now takes Assembly  questions, and it is possible that the Attorney General may answer questions in  the Chamber, the impact on the number of appearances by other Ministers will  not be significant.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment (g) relates to the amount of time that Ministers  have to respond to oral questions. The Committee on Procedures was concerned  that some Ministers did not reply to a sufficient number of questions during  the half hour allotted to them. The Committee had agreed that a time limit of  two minutes should be imposed on the Minister&rsquo;s response to a lead question and  one minute to each supplementary question. However, since the motion was placed  on the Order Paper, the Committee has met and decided to re-examine the matter.  Therefore, it was unanimously agreed by the Committee that amendment (g) will  not be moved today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If Members agree the amendments moved today, they will come  into effect from the start of the next session in September.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Leonard</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. The Chairperson has outlined the  main provisions, and debate and work has been going on in the Committee for  some time. Obviously, one amendment has been left aside for further  consideration. The ramifications of the amendments are intended to increase the  efficiency of the place, and we agree with the provisions.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  Like the previous Member to speak, I will be brief. I entirely agree with the  amendments. I congratulate the Chairperson on his efforts in bringing it to  this stage, and I also congratulate the hard-working staff who have applied  themselves very effectively and efficiently to ensure that we have these  changes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The changes are not of monumental size by any means, but  they are very much common sense. They will ensure that the House operates on a  more user-friendly basis. In the past, we have been tied by our Standing  Orders, and rightly so. However, there was never a provision to be flexible,  and that is one of the things that has been lacking. The proposal put forward  by the Chairperson of the Committee on Procedures is practical and sensible,  and it brings a degree of rationale to the sittings of the Assembly. Without  this provision, there was no flexibility whereby the Assembly could meet after  7.00 pm, even if an additional 20 or 30 minutes were needed to tidy up the  business, and, to some degree, it brought some confusion later.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment (f), which relates to Question Time, is a  sensible move, particularly in light of the fact that justice is now devolved  to this Administration. It is only right and proper to have one hour on a  Monday and one hour on a Tuesday for Question Time. Question Time should be the  highlight of the week in the House. Unfortunately, it is not. It behoves us all  to work hard to change that and to bring about a situation where Members are  fighting to get through the doors to get their seats at Question Time.  Unfortunately, that is not the way at present. I suspect, as someone said, they  are fighting to get out before it starts, and we want to kill that sort of  atmosphere.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic" align="center" style="text-align:center;">(Mr Deputy  Speaker [Mr McClarty] in the Chair)</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, as a result of the further devolution of powers to  this Assembly, it is a sensible proposal to have two Question Times on a  Tuesday. I give that proposal my wholehearted support.</p>

    <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="i"></a>Public Accounts Committee Reports</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30  minutes for the debate. The proposer of the motion will have 15 minutes to  propose and 15 minutes to make a winding-up speech. All other Members who wish  to speak will have seven minutes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Public Accounts Committee (Mr P Maskey)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly takes note of the Public Accounts  Committee Fourth Composite Report (NIA 62/09/10R) and First Thematic Report  (NIA 65/09/10R).</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I saw the  Minister of Finance and Personnel running through the door to the Chamber. I am  glad to see that he was able to make it in time for the debate and did not make  the same mistake that someone else did last week. Fair play to him for making  the effort, particularly as we are ahead of schedule today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) monitors public  expenditure through its scrutiny of the reports of the NI Audit Office. At the  front end of the process, the elected members of the Committee offer a high  level of attendance and commitment, and I thank them for the sustained effort  that they give to the Committee.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee&rsquo;s objective is to examine, on behalf of the  Assembly, whether public spending has been properly authorised and wisely  carried out. That role is a crucial part of parliamentary democracy, and it  demonstrates the legislature&rsquo;s putting on a brake on, or adding a checking  mechanism to, the power of the Executive.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee receives evidence from departmental  accounting officers about the spending decisions that are taken in their  Departments. PAC considers and weighs that evidence, often asks for more detail  by correspondence and prepares a report and recommendations. Under the  authority of the Minister of Finance and Personnel, Departments prepare  memorandums of response to the Committee&rsquo;s recommendations. The Committee  follows those up as it sees fit or refers them to the relevant Statutory  Committee to monitor progress. The Committee enjoys a significantly high  profile but also significant responsibility. That is because the officials who  answer to it are the most senior in their Departments. It is also because,  unfortunately, the cases that come to the PAC are usually the worst examples of  financial management in the public sector.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To set that more clearly in perspective, I will read from  the most recent report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, which was  published in 2009:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Despite a challenging environment for all concerned,  I consider the standards of financial accounting remains high, demonstrated by  the quality and timeliness of financial reporting in 2007-08. The vast majority  of accounts submitted received an unqualified audit opinion. Such attainments  help to build public confidence in the process of accountability and  governance.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The Comptroller and Auditor General, having  prepared 175 statutory audits and audits by agreement, qualified about 5% of  central government audits. In other words, 95% of audits demonstrated good financial  management and strong governance arrangements. That is an impressive statement  of performance on the local public sector, and I am delighted to recognise  that. It is difficult to maintain such a high standard at all times. The  optimal performance that we expect of accounting officers is one that we expect  of few professionals. Given that they do not meet our expectations only 5% of  the time, the stakes are high.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I repeat that the cases that come before the PAC are the  worst examples of financial management in the public sector. To do our job, we  have to highlight the relatively rare examples in which performance is not  optimal. As an American President once said of parliamentary scrutiny:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;There is some scandal and discomfort, but infinite  advantage, in having every affair of administration subjected to the test of  constant examination on the part of the assembly&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Public Accounts Committee has been bringing an annual  take-note debate to the House for some time. On each occasion, the Chairperson  has reminded the House of the singular business and remit of the Committee.  Since its most recent take-note debate in September 2009, the Committee decided  to report to the House more often. As Members become more familiar with the  role of the Committee, I expect that I will explain less and discuss more  during the debates.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">After a lengthy period that was spent catching up on  reports that the Comptroller and Auditor General had written during the  suspension of the institutions, the Committee caught its breath last autumn and  agreed to consider fewer reports, but in more depth. The Committee also  considered some of the points that were made by the Minister in September 2009,  and it has demonstrated how to take constructive criticism. The Minister  suggested that systems and bureaucracy had perhaps sprung up in response to the  Committee&rsquo;s 450 recommendations since devolution. He pointed out that  departmental resources were diverted to implement the Committee&rsquo;s  recommendations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee agreed to focus and revise its  recommendations before signing off its reports and to make fewer and tighter  recommendations. We also agreed to prioritise the lessons learned from each  inquiry in the hope that fewer recommendations would lead to more effective  implementation. We referred an Audit Office report to the Statutory Committee  for the first time and received positive feedback from that exercise. The  Minister was also struck by the time that had passed since the events that led  to some of our inquiries. I pointed out that the Committee&rsquo;s aim was simply  that lessons from those events should be learned.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Members will see today, the Committee decided, on foot  of its deliberations, to bring a different product to the House. Its first  thematic report deals with the management of complex projects and recaps on  lessons from the Committee&rsquo;s back catalogue that it wanted to reaffirm. In  looking back at the themes that it has encountered, it did not find that old  cases have nothing to teach us. The Committee&rsquo;s first thematic report  demonstrates that learning in the four stages of project management has been  repeatedly overlooked in successive projects.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee drew out stark lessons on specification, the  composition of project teams, the complexity and size of projects envisaged,  the appraisal process, actions to protect the taxpayer and post-project  evaluation. Those lessons must now be learned. It is not only unacceptable but  negligent to repeat such costly mistakes. The Committee reviewed 11 cases of  project management for its first thematic report. Those ranged over the past  three years of the Committee&rsquo;s work, but, in some cases, many years had passed  since the events that provoked inquiry. One issue that concerns me greatly is  that over-optimism or optimism bias by public servants recurred over time. In  some instances, pressure of time allowed optimistic judgements to carry on a  project that would not have passed rigorous appraisal.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">For instance, in the Committee&rsquo;s case study inquiry into  the inward investment of grant aid to Valence Technology, safeguards were  bypassed at the appraisal stage due to the pressure to create jobs and to snap  up what appeared to be an innovative product. That led the Committee to  recognise:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;weak project proposals may well be accompanied by  demands for quick decisions. It is a particular responsibility of senior  management, therefore, to ensure that previous experience is not overlooked  under the pressure to secure a project.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">and to recommend:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;sufficient time is always devoted to project  appraisals and that all aspects are thoroughly assessed, with any weaknesses  properly addressed&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That failure was compounded by the fact that the  project was not reappraised and subsequently halted. Rushing such projects also  increases the risk that the public sector does not get a good deal for  taxpayers&rsquo; money.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Optimism has also been a problem in planning projects that  are simply too complex. From the composition of project management teams to the  capacity of Departments to support reforms and service transformation, several  cases have demonstrated how optimism can create an unworkable burden that ends  in poor or failed delivery, demotivation and waste. The PFI pathfinder project  and the statement of rate levy reports spring to mind. However, I must credit  some of the good work that has been done in the shared services reform  programme.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are aware that Departments see PAC hearings as a  daunting prospect, but we must insist on rolling out good practice. The  Committee is also aware of the good work that is being done, and we hope that  our first thematic report will start a new and positive conversation about how  to improve project management across the public sector. It is not like me to  endorse words from politicians from Westminster, but I am happy to endorse the  conclusion of Edward Leigh, who recently stood down as Chairperson of the  Westminster Public Accounts Committee:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Government must learn from experience. Government  needs to learn from its failures and its successes, so that mistakes in one  part are not repeated elsewhere. &hellip; Public scrutiny adds value.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That is the message that our Committee wants to send out,  loud and clear. Our reports have tried to send that message out, and the  Committee is presenting its fourth composite report to the House. Members will  now address the content of both reports.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  One of the issues that our thematic report brings out is the need for a robust  and complete project specification. A project specification is essential  because it acts as the terms of reference for a project and provides a  description of what it aims to achieve, as well as the timescales and the work  that is required to ensure that it achieves the desired outcomes. If a  specification is wrong, a project will be flawed from the outset, and it is  likely that there will be a cost to the public purse. A project specification  also serves as an accountability tool that can be used to assess how well a  project is progressing, and it helps us to measure its success on its  completion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, at our evidence sessions in recent years,  the Public Accounts Committee has seen poor quality project specifications for  a number of major projects, and those failings have seriously undermined their  prospects for success, as well as resulting in poor value for money.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">For example, in our 2008-09 report on rate levy and  collection, the Committee concluded that the specification for the IT system  was incomplete. We examined some basic and fundamental aspects, perhaps the  most obvious of which was the fact that a function to assist the chasing and  recovering of rates arrears was missing. It is astonishing that a new IT system  was designed to manage the rates system and a basic core function &mdash; that of  chasing, collecting and recovering rates arrears &mdash; was missing. That left a gap  that led to rates not being chased for a period. Further bad debts were  incurred and, because a modification to the original specification had to be  made, additional moneys had to be paid.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Furthermore, the system had no validation checks to  prevent manual input errors. That resulted in the issuing of some interesting  bills, including some for millions of pounds because a few extra noughts had  been added by someone who inputted the information. That brought the system  into disrepute.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The nature of the contracts, or of any contract for that  matter, is that the contractor will charge extra for any changes to them. In  the construction industry, contractors make very tight estimates because they  make their profit on extras. That is well known in the construction industry,  and government needs to get wise to the fact that that applies to other  contracts as well. One needs to be particular when issuing a contract, because  if one fails to produce a proper specification for the project, additional  moneys will be required. Given that that happens mid-term in many projects, the  contractor may ask for a blank cheque because no one else is available to do  that essential work. Therefore, people are caught out and ridiculous costs can  be incurred.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In examining the performance of the Planning Service, the  Committee identified similar problems that have resulted from incomplete and  inadequate specification of the flagship IT project, e-PIC, which has yet to be  finished. I hear that it will be finished later this year, and I hope that that  is the case. However, the so-called off-the-shelf system that was procured did  not meet the specifications of the Northern Ireland Planning Service, and,  therefore, expensive and considerable adaptation was required, which introduced  additional costs and significant time delays. As the changes were outside the  contract, the Planning Service was in a weak negotiating position. When our  report was issued in February the project was four years behind schedule with  capital costs of &pound;7&middot;3 million, which is 130% over the original budget.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, those are typical examples that the  Committee has repeatedly encountered in which inadequate specifications were  made. That leaves government at the mercy of experienced private sector  contractors who use the opportunity to make significant profit. That undermines  the value-for-money principle that the public sector ought to be striving for  through competition.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee examined issues with the Belfast to Bangor  railway line. As well as incomplete specifications, we encountered a rather  strange situation, in which poor value for money arose because projects were  over-specified. Our report into the upgrade of the Belfast to Bangor line  highlighted significant downgrading of the level of the work that was  originally planned. However, one is equally exposed to a contractor&rsquo;s costs  when a contract is upgraded. Who will put an accurate figure on the value of  work that has to be carried out to a lower level? It is the public sector that  is exposed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The relay of the line demonstrated basic failings &mdash; things  that even someone wanting to buy a model railway would get right. The speed  limit was specified at 90 mph but, guess what, they discovered that only 70 mph  was needed. When building any surface, one would get it to the required quality  because there is no point paying for extra that is not needed. Considerable  extra money would have been required to achieve that additional 20 mph, and,  therefore, the mid-contract downgrade added significant costs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There was also a significant reduction in bridge work,  drainage and sea defences. Because the change happened mid-contract, who can  put an accurate figure on the cost of the work that was carried out? It  certainly was not open to competition, because the contract had already been  entered into and the contractor was in a strong position of leverage. I see  that my time is nearly up.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member should draw his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Detailed specification and accurate work are important if we want to protect  the public purse.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>:  Unfortunately, I must begin my contribution by saying that there is still a  culture of public money being regarded differently from money in your pocket or  mine. That culture has to change. Every penny of taxpayers&rsquo; money must be  protected and tracked to its final destination, ensuring that it is accounted  for and that the services it buys represent the best value for money available.  That is essentially what the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) has sought to do  as an all-party Committee, and, to date, I believe that we have been  successful.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will illustrate my point with a couple of examples of  taxpayers&rsquo; money not being valued or protected as it should have been. Our  investigation into the transfer of surplus land in the private finance  initiative pathfinder project tells its own sorry story. In one example, land  was transferred without anyone even bothering to measure it. As a result, a  developer scooped half an acre of prime land worth an estimated &pound;400,000, with  the Department receiving not one brass penny for the taxpayer. That is bad  practice and it must be avoided in the future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In another example, an enterprising developer managed to  acquire an asset and sell it on in a few weeks, yielding a profit of &pound;175,000.  For those who do not have accountancy skills, I should say that that is a  return of 23% on an investment of &pound;750,000. That was a very good return for the  developer, a huge embarrassment for the Department and a really bad deal for  the taxpayer. I could mention other examples, but I think that the issue has  been adequately covered. Therefore, I do not intend to go into any more detail  except to emphasise that the gravy train has come to an end.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At no time should taxpayers&rsquo; money be squandered, but I  think that I am right in saying that there is an even greater need to guard the  public purse with more zeal than ever before. Every day, we are told of the  most vulnerable people in society being deprived of basic services, such as  summer schemes for children with special needs, which is very topical here  today. That money could possibly be found if taxpayers&rsquo; money was guarded with  greater respect and there was a new culture of good practice, which would stamp  out waste and get best value for money.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The PAC reports addressed the vexed question of consultants  representing very poor value for money on several occasions. Again, not a  single penny was paid in compensation where they failed miserably to perform at  the levels expected. Let us hope that the message about consultants has finally  got through.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Civil Service is a vast organisation with a great deal  of resources and backup. The practice of bringing in consultants on a whim must  end, except in circumstances in which it is not economical to retain such  skills in-house. When consultants must be brought in, there has to be a clear  understanding of the terms and conditions and the defaults if they fail to  deliver. That has not been happening across the board. Unfortunately, millions  of pounds have been wasted on dodgy IT systems that are not fit for purpose,  such as the e-PIC, which Roy Beggs mentioned. Not once have the consultants  been taken to task. That is not only wrong but truly amazing. That would not be  tolerated in the private sector, and it should not be tolerated in the public  sector.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">During these bad times, the entire procurement issue is  exercising the minds of the members of the PAC and the general public. I look  forward to more Audit Office reports that dig deep into practices across the  board where procurement is a serious issue. Recently, there was the scandal of  Northern Ireland Water awarding contracts of &pound;500,000 without tendering.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In these difficult times, government contracts are the  lifeblood of small and medium-sized businesses. Questions will be asked when it  is not immediately obvious that procurement practices are crystal clear or  easily understood. That applies not just to Departments but to other agencies,  health and social care trusts, education and library boards, and just about  every other organisation that survives on public money. People who fail to win  contracts or who have lost existing contracts are entitled to clarity at every  stage of the process. The tendering system must be designed to deliver the best  possible service at the least cost.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, I want to pay tribute to the Comptroller and  Auditor General and his staff for their professionalism and determination to  work in harmony with the Public Accounts Committee to achieve a level of  scrutiny that is first class and is most likely to reduce costs and to produce  a much better level of service for the public whom we all represent.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: As  a non-member of the Public Accounts Committee, I am privileged to speak in the  debate. I want to take the opportunity to place some of the reports in a  slightly wider context. First, I want to join other Members in paying tribute  to the Committee&rsquo;s work, both the contribution of elected members and that of  staff. Certainly, I am impressed by the sheer volume of reports that have  arrived on my desk from the Committee. I do my best to, at least, read the  executive summaries of all those reports. I also want to recognise the good  work that is done by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Northern  Ireland Audit Office to provide the background work to the scrutiny that is  conducted through the Public Accounts Committee.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clearly, in the current context, every penny and every  pound of public expenditure counts. Therefore, it is vital that the Assembly  ensures that there is value for money and that, where there is waste in  government and poor decisions are made, those issues are brought to our  attention and are challenged properly. It is also important to recognise that  the Assembly must not simply be reactive, respond to mistakes that have  happened and give someone a slap on the wrist or even stronger chastisement. It  is important that we actually try to front-load best practice in governance; to  learn lessons from what has happened and make changes; and to ensure that all  Departments and public bodies employ best practice in such matters as internal  governance, risk registers and running audit committees, which should include  independent members to challenge how policies are implemented.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although I recognise the sterling work that is done, in the  past, the PAC&rsquo;s work was often almost a snapshot of individual mistakes in  different areas. I certainly welcome what I understand now to be a different  approach as regards thematic reports. That is an important contribution to try  to tie some of those issues together to widen the process of learning lessons.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That said, it is also worth acknowledging that, although  MLAs will be critical of officials when mistakes have been made &mdash; which is  quite right as part of the scrutiny process &mdash; we must be aware that we also  have to look back at ourselves. We take decisions in the Executive, the  Assembly or elsewhere that have implications for how well public money is spent  or otherwise. Certain political decisions are taken, not taken, delayed or  taken in haste that have major consequences for public spending. Sometimes,  scrutiny does not fall back on us to the same extent that it falls on individual  project-management decisions taken by officials, which are often put through  the Public Accounts Committee process. Therefore, although today&rsquo;s debate and  the exercise that has been conducted during the past number of months are  useful, they can be only part of a wider process of scrutiny.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I also want to stress that we must balance public  accounting and audit activity with the need to ensure that, in government, we  make swift and effective decisions at a political level. Our officials must do  likewise when, for instance, they produce economic appraisals for Ministers.  There is an impression that, for a host of reasons, decisions are made slowly  in Northern Ireland. That has consequences for the economy. I do not want a  conservative and risk-averse culture to become engendered in government,  particularly at an official level. That is not for one minute an invitation to  people to cut corners. It may point to a need to invest properly in the  internal machinery of government to ensure that decisions are taken  effectively.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That comes back to the neat distinction that Members often  make between front line services and the back office. We try to put all the  money into the front line and cut administrative costs. Administrators are  important in informing proper decision-making and ensuring the effective use of  front line services. Our taking note of the PAC reports should remind us of the  importance of ensuring that we resource the internal scrutiny processes in  Departments and that proper, effective and speedy decisions are being made. The  remedy is to achieve value for money at the same time as being able to seize,  rather than miss out on, opportunities that come our way.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the context of the looming financial cuts that will only  get deeper over the months and years to come, I stress that the Civil Service  will have to do things differently. If we simply fall back into a conservative  consideration of issues and concentrate on the statutory duties of the  Departments, we will not make the best use of the resources that are available  to us. We must focus on early intervention and prevention and encourage  collaboration between Departments. That, however, involves taking risks and  entering new and unfamiliar territories. Sometimes, the evidence base for  success that, traditionally, would have justified a decision to shift resources,  may not exist. If we are to preserve the level of public service that we want,  however, we will have to consider adopting that different approach.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As MLAs, we must communicate to the officials who work for  us the importance of being imaginative and of being prepared to be innovative.  We must stress to them that resources must be protected and used to achieve  value for money. That involves resourcing, but it is not a licence to cut corners.  In discussing the issue, we must take that kind of rounded and balanced  approach.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hilditch</strong>:  I welcome the debate, which highlights the fine work of the Committee. I take  the opportunity, as other Members have done, to thank the Committee staff for their  sterling work in conjunction with the Audit Office. It is an area of work that  came to the fore only because of devolution, before which no one paid much  attention to what the PAC at Westminster was doing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am a member of the PAC and speak as such. However, as an  individual, I have seen the benefit of having an Assembly Public Accounts  Committee. Back in 1998, I was a member of the PAC during the first mandate. It  was regrettable that the momentum was lost when devolution was suspended, and a  few people went back to their bad old ways. We are three years into the current  mandate, and the culture of good practice is returning. It is up to the Public  Accounts Committee to ensure that delivery, value for money and best measures  are put in place across the board.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The PAC has examined cases ranging from bad practice and  maladministration to fraud. I will focus on one particular case of fraud in the  Sports Institute Northern Ireland, which is an arm&rsquo;s-length body and a joint  venture company that was established by the Sports Council for Northern Ireland  and the University of Ulster. The Committee learned from the Comptroller and  Auditor General that a senior member of staff at the Sports Institute Northern  Ireland had committed fraud.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The tale of this fraud &mdash; how it was committed, the control  weaknesses that gave rise to it and the response of the company and its  sponsors to its discovery &mdash; presents some important lessons for the public  sector. Nearly &pound;75,000 was stolen during an 11-month period from October 2005  to August 2006. The fraudster stole the money in several ways, including  writing and cashing company cheques, but he took most of the money by abusing  the company&rsquo;s online banking system to make payments on his own behalf and  manipulating the payroll records to cover his tracks.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">He was able to get away with it for nearly a year, due  largely to the lack of effective controls in the Sports Institute Northern  Ireland. There was no functioning separation of duties in its finance section,  and there was inadequate management supervision of the individual&rsquo;s work. It  was clear that the most basic controls and general governance arrangements were  not in place. Such controls would have helped to prevent or detect the fraud.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">More alarming is the fact that there was no evidence of any  check of the fraudster&rsquo;s academic or professional qualifications, which seems  strange in this day and age. Nor was there evidence that references from  previous employers were taken up before he was employed. It also appears that  several warning signs in his behaviour went unnoticed by management for some  considerable time, and an opportunity was missed to launch a fraud  investigation when some absolutely damning facts came to light.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Once the fraud was discovered, the Sports Institute Northern  Ireland took swift action to suspend the fraudster and report his activities to  the police. He was subsequently dismissed and prosecuted. The Sports Institute  Northern Ireland undertook a forensic audit to establish the history and extent  of the fraud, but, unfortunately, it was not carried out by professional  investigators and some of its activities could have compromised a prosecution.  In the event, however, the fraudster chose to plead guilty in court.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We were pleased to be informed by the Department of  Culture, Arts and Leisure (DCAL) that robust financial management and reporting  has now been established in the Sports Institute Northern Ireland and that  action has been taken to ensure that the lessons learnt from the NIAO&rsquo;s report  were applied effectively in the Department and in its arm&rsquo;s-length bodies. We  were also heartened by the improvements made to the Department&rsquo;s arrangements  for undertaking proactive and reactive counter-fraud work. DCAL has issued  updated guidance to all its arm&rsquo;s-length bodies detailing the controls that  should be noted and requiring an assurance that such controls have been  implemented. DCAL has also made significant progress on the sponsorship  arrangements.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department states that it has a service level agreement  for the provision of fraud investigation services, which provides sufficient  resources for the Department and its arm&rsquo;s-length bodies to respond  appropriately to any suspected or, indeed, actual cases of fraud. It remains a  concern, however, that &pound;10,000 has yet to be recovered, despite the fraudster&rsquo;s  conviction in 2007. Some may say that we were lucky to get the balance back,  but the Department has told us that it is considering options on the way  forward. We expect to see the recovery of those outstanding public funds some  time in the future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">No one is beyond the reach of the PAC, whether in a  Department, an arm&rsquo;s-length body, or even if they are at a hand&rsquo;s length or a  fingertip&rsquo;s reach. Lessons are being learned and we expect to witness  improvements across all Departments in the way that we did as time passed in  the 1998 Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure (Mr McElduff)</strong>: Go raibh  maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. The Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure  was, obviously, aware of the primacy of the PAC in the matter of the fraud in  the Sports Institute. We were aware that the PAC was looking into that matter  when our Committee began its own review of the Department&rsquo;s management of the  NI Events Company and its arm&rsquo;s-length bodies. The PAC report found that there  was a lack of oversight of the Sports Institute by Sport NI and the Department  and that that was also the case with the Events Company because it was so much  at arm&rsquo;s length that Department did not know that it was in debt until it was  far too late.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to diverge briefly. The company&rsquo;s inspectorate, as I  understand it, is still carrying out an investigation into what happened with  the Events Company, and the Committee does not want to prejudice that in any way.  However, the report refers to lessons learned by DCAL about departmental  oversight of arm&rsquo;s-length bodies, and those lessons should be disseminated to  other Departments. Everyone knows, not least the Committee and the Minister for  Culture, Arts and Leisure, that a significant percentage of the Department&rsquo;s  work is devolved to arm&rsquo;s-length bodies in DCAL.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In October 2008, the Committee agreed to review the role of  the Department in managing the Events Company and its other arm&rsquo;s-length  bodies. We took evidence from the Department in closed session.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In its findings on how the Department managed that  particular arm&rsquo;s-length organisation, the Committee noted with concern the  Department&rsquo;s shortcomings with regard to how it discharged its sponsorship  function. However, because of the potential for future criminal and/or civil  proceedings and possible sub-judice issues, and the risk of prejudicing any  future prosecution or legal action, the Committee decided to take no further  action at that time.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee believes that the undertaking that the  Department has given is a positive step, and it looks forward to receiving  regular updates from the Department on, for example, matters relating to the  Events Company. The Committee also conducted case studies with Sport NI and the  Arts Council on sponsorship arrangements with the Department. The Committee  made 10 recommendations, which it followed up with the Department during 2009.  I will outline the four key points.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">First, board members of arm&rsquo;s-length bodies need to take  their responsibilities very seriously and must attend mandatory training within  six months of joining a board; if they do not, the Department must ask them to  reconsider their position. Secondly, arm&rsquo;s-length bodies&rsquo; senior management  teams should include someone with an accountancy qualification. Thirdly, boards  should have at least one qualified accountant on them; they also need financial  skills so that they can scrutinise the body&rsquo;s accounts. Finally, the quorum of  internal audit committees of arm&rsquo;s-length bodies should be three persons. Those  are strong recommendations from the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure  with respect to departmental sponsorship of arm&rsquo;s-length bodies.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: As Question Time commences at 3.00 pm, I suggest that the House  take its ease until that time. The debate will continue after Question Time,  when the next Member called to speak will be Patsy McGlone.</p>

    <p class="OralAnswers-H2DepartmentHeading">Culture, Arts and Leisure</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Questions 1, 2, 5 and 15 have been withdrawn.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Sports Provision</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">3. <strong>Mr  McCallister </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure for his  assessment of the findings of his Department&rsquo;s &lsquo;Experience of Sport and  Physical Activity in Northern Ireland&rsquo; survey, which found that 53% of people  were satisfied with sports provision.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  1512/10<a name="AQO1512/10" id="AQO1512/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure (Mr McCausland)</strong>: The most recently published  findings from the continuous household survey, &lsquo;Experience of Sport and  Physical Activity in Northern Ireland&rsquo;, confirms my long-held view that,  although there are some good examples of sports provision in Northern Ireland,  it does not fully meet public need and is, therefore, inadequate as a whole. It  is partly for that reason that I recently launched a new 10-year strategy for  sport and physical recreation entitled &lsquo;Sport Matters: the Northern Ireland  Strategy for Sport and Physical Recreation 2009-2019&rsquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Sport Matters already reflects the aspirations of people in  Northern Ireland for a sea change in the quantity and standard of sporting  provision. Delivering that requires not only significant and sustained  investment but a more strategic and co-ordinated approach to the use of  existing provision. Work on implementing Sport Matters has begun. In that  context, I recently met the Minister of Education, Caitr&iacute;ona Ruane MLA, to  discuss how our Departments might work together to help to address the demand  for improved public access to sports facility provision in, for example, the  education sector. That is one of a range of actions aimed at improving sports  provision that my Department and I will be seeking to take forward in  conjunction with relevant partners and stakeholder groups as part of the  delivery of Sport Matters.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I am grateful to the Minister for his reply. Given the disappointing results in  the survey, I welcome the 10-year plan to address the problem. When does the  Minister hope to see those results improve? Is there a chance to review that  plan at different stages in order to ensure that we are making progress in the  right areas?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I hope that we will soon see progress in a  number of areas and that the strategy will improve those figures. The report  was launched on 13 May, and we have already established a Sport Matters  monitoring group to oversee the delivery of the strategy. The group includes  representatives from the Departments of Culture, Arts and Leisure, Health,  Education and Social Development; Sport NI; local government; and the Northern  Ireland Sports Forum.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Frew</strong>:  Will the Minister tell the House how the results of the recently published  survey on satisfaction with sports provision compare with, for instance,  national trends across the UK?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: The most recent figures available suggest that  Northern Ireland still falls well below the national trend for overall  satisfaction, which currently stands at just over 69%. In my view, there is a  correlation between the Northern Ireland results and the separate but more  general evidence that, in comparison with other regions of the United Kingdom,  we are significantly underprovided for in respect of, for example, sports facilities,  such as swimming pools, pitches, playing courts and athletic facilities. That  is one of the matters that I will be seeking to address through Sport Matters.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Leonard</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. The Minister mentioned the Department  of Education and the Department of Health. How does he see the rolling out of  co-operation with those Departments in trying to instil in young people a  positive attitude to participation in sport and physical exercise in the  immediate future?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I encourage the Member to read the strategy,  which is comprehensive. It has three main pillars: places, which relates to  facilities; participation, which deals with trying to increase the number of  people participating in sports activities; and performance, which deals with  helping people to realise their potential. In that regard, the strategy sets  out a number of avenues, and working groups across those Departments will  operate under the overall monitoring group to see that the strategy is  implemented and is effective.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burns</strong>:  What is the Minister&rsquo;s assessment of the finding that 40% of people do not  enjoy taking part in sports? Does he agree that a culture change is needed in  our schools to tackle that attitude?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I welcome the Member&rsquo;s valid question about how  we can encourage more people to adopt a less sedentary lifestyle. Our society  has become much more sedentary. For some, the solution could include cycling,  which would keep Mr McDevitt very happy, and, for others, it could include a  great deal of walking over the next few months, which would keep the rest of us  very happy. Many things could be done over the coming months to improve the  activity levels of Members.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Seriously and more generally, increased participation has  to be and is a target in the strategy. Improving aspirations and attitudes  towards sport has to be done through education and health services to make  people realise the physical and health benefits that flow from activities,  whatever they may be, in the realm of sport. There is no single answer to that  question. The entire strategy will come together in a range of ways that will,  I hope, increase the percentage of people participating in sport in Northern Ireland.  It will help if we have more facilities that are more accessible. Events such  as the Olympics impact on participation levels. The other day, I was at a  gymnastics club in Bangor, and it had noted an increase in the number of young  people registering as a result of the success of a gymnastics group on  &lsquo;Britain&rsquo;s Got Talent&rsquo;. Therefore, a range of factors come into play, and  anything and everything that will increase participation must be welcomed.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">F&eacute;ile an Phobail</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">4. <strong>Ms S  Ramsey </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure for his assessment  of the cultural and economic importance of F&eacute;ile an Phobail.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 1513/10<a name="AQO1513/10" id="AQO1513/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: The Department does not have figures on the  economic value of F&eacute;ile an Phobail. However, we know that investment in the  arts and the creative sector directly strengthens the Northern Ireland economy  because such investment fuels the emergence of creative people, services and  enterprises. In August, F&eacute;ile an Phobail provides festival goers with a wide  range of music, comedy, drama, exhibitions and family events. The programming  range extends to the early spring through F&eacute;ile an Earraigh and to October  through the Dra&iacute;ocht children&rsquo;s arts festival.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. I thank the Minister for his answer. Are figures available  to show what is happening at an economic level? Given current trends, we need  evidence, I think that the Minister would agree that F&eacute;ile an Phobail plays an  important role not only in the local community but in the wider community, and  it is regarded as one of the top community festivals in Europe. Will the  Minister explain the support that his Department gives to the festival and  whether DCAL is working closely with Invest NI and the Department of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment to promote tourism, especially as we examine  other ways to get money into the North?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: The responsibility for a particular festival to  demonstrate its economic benefits has to lie with that festival. My  recollection is that work was done some years ago, possibly funded by the  Department for Social Development, to examine the economic benefits that flow  from F&eacute;ile an Phobail. However, if we were to start to do that, we would have  to examine all festivals. General work could be done, but it would be  impossible to deal with each festival individually.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member asked about the funding provided to F&eacute;ile an  Phobail. Last year, under the annual support for organisations programme (ASOP)  funding scheme, the Arts Council provided &pound;123,000 to F&eacute;ile an Phobail. Lottery  project funding of &pound;23,000 was given to the programming costs of the August  F&eacute;ile, and &pound;50,000 from the creative industries innovation fund went towards  the cost of a creative development officer post. This year, the Arts Council is  providing &pound;123,000 in ASOP funding towards the festival. For the past two  years, Foras na Gaeilge has provided &pound;15,000 towards the August F&eacute;ile, &pound;4,000  towards the spring festival and &pound;1,000 towards the children&rsquo;s festival.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  Does the Minister have any plans to attend the festival this year?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I have not seen the programme, and I have not  received an invitation.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his precise answers. I wish that his colleagues in the  House would stick to that regime as well. Congratulations, Minister.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has given us some good figures on funding  sources. How much public money from central or local government goes to the  West Belfast Festival, and how much money does it attract from private  sponsorships and donations from the public?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: The figures that I provided are for central  government funding. I presume that local government funding is also provided. I  am aware that a number of private sector organisations sponsor F&eacute;ile. For  example, in previous years, even Translink gave money to F&eacute;ile. Therefore, it  receives some private sector funding, but I am not aware of the exact amount.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question 5 has been withdrawn, and the Member who tabled question  6 is not in his place.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Windsor Park</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">7. <strong>Mr B  Wilson </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure for an update on the  proposal to redevelop Windsor Park.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  1516/10<a name="AQO1516/10" id="AQO1516/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I am disappointed by some Members&rsquo; lack of  attendance. I had prepared some good answers, and I am disappointed that I am  not able to use them. However, I welcome the fact that Mr Wilson is in his  place.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Sport NI commissioned consultants to produce an outline  business case on the value for money, operational viability, sustainability and  affordability of the stadium options put forward by the governing bodies of  football, rugby and Gaelic games, and it is aimed at meeting their long-term  needs. Members will be aware that the IFA has said that its preferred option is  the refurbishment of Windsor Park. That has proved to be a complex and  time-intensive exercise. However, it is important that the ongoing consultancy  fully and rigorously appraises the governing bodies&rsquo; stadium options together  with a range of other options for stadium development and that it provides a  sound basis for determining the way forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The sports governing bodies have been actively involved in  discussion with the consultants, the Department and Sport NI throughout the  process. It is anticipated that the consultants will report to me formally in  the near future, after which my Department and Sport NI will review the  proposals. It will also be essential that the Department of Finance and  Personnel scrutinise and comment on the outline business case. Ultimately,  having fully considered the outcome of the outline business case, I will bring  my proposals on regional stadium development to the Executive for their  consideration.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his response. Many issues have still to be resolved. I  have attended Windsor Park as part of a crowd of 50,000. It is absolutely  deplorable that we are under threat from FIFA and may not be able to hold  international matches there. The future of international football at Windsor  Park and in Belfast in general is in danger, so will the Minister ensure that  something is done very soon?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: A limited remedial programme of work at Windsor  Park is planned to ensure that international football can continue to be played  there until a longer-term solution is found. That work will involve arresting  the deterioration of the north stand roof, regrading the pitch perimeter and  bridging the moats at the north and west stands. The cost, to which the IFA  will contribute, is estimated to be &pound;443,000.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Will the Minister confirm that his  approach and that of his Department to stadium development is based on the  strategic requirements of each of the governing bodies of football? What  percentage contribution is each of the governing bodies expected to make to the  individual projects, and how much is in the pot of funding for stadium  development?</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: The answer to the first part of the question is  yes. The answer to the second part is that the cost of each stadium has not  been finalised. We have to await completion of the outline business case and  our consideration of it before that can be assessed. I made it clear to the  governing bodies that they will be required to contribute to the cost. I am  also conscious that their ability to do so will vary between the sports. As the  Member is aware, the indicative envelope originally mentioned was about &pound;110  million.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  The Minister detailed his commitment to the short-term future of Windsor Park  and its redevelopment. Will he assure the House that he and his Department are  committed to the future of Northern Ireland games in Belfast and to ensuring  that Northern Ireland football can move forward?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I am determined that Northern Ireland should  have a facility for football games at international level that is fit for  purpose, suitable for the twenty-first century and meets the sport&rsquo;s strategic  needs. We are determined to see that through to a conclusion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  Given that &pound;110 million is available, would it not be worth the Executive&rsquo;s time  to consider, even at this late stage, whether that should be invested in one  new shared stadium, possibly in Belfast, rather than investing it in three  separate, never-to-be shared stadia?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: The decision to move in the present direction  was taken before my time. It was taken by my predecessor and agreed by the  Executive. The Member speaks of never-to-be shared stadia. I do not share his  sense of despondency. I would hope that each ground would be open and  accessible to others. I am sure that the Member shares that aspiration and  would want to see each of the three grounds accessible to sports other than the  sport that is the primary user of that facility.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Motorsport</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">8. <strong>Miss  McIlveen </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure for his assessment  of the value of motorsport as part of the culture of Northern Ireland.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 1517/10<a name="AQO1517/10" id="AQO1517/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: Northern Ireland enjoys a motorsport tradition  dating back to the 1920s and has produced world-class competitors in two- and  four-wheel disciplines. Motorsport, particularly motorcycle racing, provides  some of the major sporting events held in the Province. The North West 200  festival week, for example, is the biggest event in our sporting calendar,  attracting an estimated 100,000 spectators from all over the world. I am also  aware that many people of all ages from across the whole community regularly  enjoy the thrills of different types of motor racing on offer at dedicated  circuits such as Bishopscourt, Nutts Corner and Kirkistown. Such events provide  us with a wonderful opportunity to promote a positive image of Northern Ireland  on an international stage, showcasing our many attractions while making a major  contribution to the economy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am committed to working closely with the umbrella body  for motorsport in Northern Ireland, 2&amp;4 Wheels, to help to develop the  sport to its full potential and make Northern Ireland the motorsport capital of  the world.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer. Sport NI obviously delivers for sports in  Northern Ireland and is just one of the Department&rsquo;s many arm&rsquo;s-length bodies.  What is the cost of the chief executives of DCAL&rsquo;s arm&rsquo;s-length bodies?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: The annual salaries of and expenses paid to  chief executives of all DCAL&rsquo;s arm&rsquo;s-length bodies in the year ending 31 March  2010 are as follows: for the Arts Council of Northern Ireland, salary  expenditure was &pound;72,126 and expenses were &pound;997, making a total of &pound;73,123; for  Northern Ireland Screen, the salary amounted to &pound;65,976 and expenses were  &pound;4,769, which makes a total of &pound;70,745; in the case of the Armagh Observatory,  the Armagh Planetarium and the Northern Ireland Museums Council, the  information is not available; for Libraries NI, the salary amounted to &pound;96,888  and expenses came to &pound;3,324, making a total of &pound;100,212; for National Museums  Northern Ireland, the salary was &pound;119,745 and expenses amounted to &pound;1,738,  which makes a total of &pound;121,484; for Sport NI, the salary comes to &pound;90,755 and  expenses to &pound;4,566, which makes a total of &pound;95,321; for Foras na Gaeilge, the  salary comes to &pound;119,271 and expenses to &pound;6,603, which makes a total of  &pound;125,874, which is the largest total amount; for the Ulster-Scots Agency, the  salary was &pound;50,224 and there were no expenses; for the Fisheries Conservancy  Board, which no longer exists, the salary came to the small sum of &pound;8,074 and  expenses to &pound;294; and for Waterways Ireland, the salary came to &pound;91,436 and  expenses to &pound;3,704, making a total of &pound;95,140.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  The Minister is aware that the Strangford constituency provides an excellent  short circuit racecourse at Kirkistown, and I am glad that he mentioned it in  an earlier response. Can he tell the House to what extent his Department  supports that excellent facility, in finance or publicity, so as to secure its  future?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: The Department has earmarked up to &pound;2 million to  help motorsport improve health and safety at venues across Northern Ireland. An  approved business case for that funding was developed by Sport Northern Ireland  together with the umbrella body for motorsports here, the 2 &amp; 4 Wheel Motor  Sport Steering Group Limited. As part of that, consideration is being given to  the possible allocation of &pound;1<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; ">&#8729;</span>155  million to Nutts Corner, Kirkistown and Bishopscourt race circuits. A further  award of &pound;219,700 has already been made for the purchase of a range of safety  equipment, and &pound;155,000 has been spent on urgent safety works at the North West  200 and the Cookstown 100. Other safety works at various venues have been  identified, covering 33 projects at 25 motorsport clubs, and a project  management team has been appointed to oversee those works.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: There  has been a great tradition of four-wheeled motorsport in Ireland which is now  significantly diminished. I welcome anything that the Minister can do to  maintain and enhance that tradition. In particular, are there any plans to hold  another Rally Ireland event in the grounds of Stormont, following the great  success of the Stormont spectacular?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: I have no knowledge of any plans in that regard.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Community Festivals Fund</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">9. <strong>Mr  Givan </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure what assessment his  Department has made of the success of the community festivals fund since local  government became responsible for its delivery.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  1518/10<a name="AQO1518/10" id="AQO1518/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: The transfer of the community festivals fund to  district councils has been a success. Councils report that value was added to  existing festivals and that events and activities not previously supported have  received funding. Eight times more festivals were funded in the first year that  the fund was administered by the councils. Councils report benefits to the  local economy, and the hospitality and retail sectors experienced increased  numbers of participants and tourist visitors. There has been a strong focus not  only on cross-community events but on cultural diversity events to maximise the  involvement of ethnic minorities.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Givan</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his response. Does he agree that district councils&rsquo;  administering of funding has gone some way to address the underfunding that the  Loyal Orders experienced through the previous system, which was administered by  the Events Company? Does he further agree that councils in many unionist  communities that did not previously get funding are now receiving financial support  and that the Loyal Orders are now getting more money than they did under direct  rule?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: There was a rather bizarre system under direct  rule, whereby, if a group was locked into the system to get funding, it kept  getting funding, yet if a group was locked out, it was permanently locked out.  It was one of the most discriminatory and inequitable systems that I have ever  come across, yet, because it was done under direct rule, virtually nothing  could be done about it. That situation has now been remedied, and I agree that  many of the festivals that the Loyal Orders organise have accessed funding from  local authorities. That has been very successful, and many thousands of people  turn up at such events and benefit from them and from the funding that is  provided in that way.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Music: Performing Rights Royalties</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">10. <strong>Mr P  Ramsey </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure for his assessment  of whether the current arrangements for the collection and distribution of performing  rights royalties provide maximum benefit to the local music industry and what  assessment has been made of alternative collection and distribution  arrangements.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 1519/10<a name="AQO1519/10" id="AQO1519/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: The Performing Right Society for Music is a  UK-wide royalty collection and distribution agency that provides services for  clients in Northern Ireland. I am aware that the Northern Ireland Music Rights  Society wishes to act as a royalty collection agency here. My officials have  been liaising with the Northern Ireland Music Rights Society to hear its  concerns. My Department and I need to be convinced that there is a clear  rationale behind and support for a dedicated local music rights society. I have  asked the Northern Ireland Music Rights Society to prepare a feasibility study,  and I will consider any submissions carefully.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer. There is concern in the local music  industry that there is a serious loss in revenue because it is going into  Britain but is not coming back to local artists in Northern Ireland. Could I  persuade the Minister to meet the group to advance the feasibility study and to  discuss the loss of those rights?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: A number of such submissions on that matter has  been made over the years. I said that we need a clearly set out, stable and  strengthened feasibility study to support the case. As soon as we receive that,  we will consider it fully and very carefully. I do not wish to go beyond that  at this stage. It is important that we get something down on paper so that  there is a clearly demonstrated case. If that stands up, we will look seriously  at it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  shall approach the matter from a slightly different angle. The Minister will be  aware that, when what is now the Digital Economy Act 2010 was proceeding  through Westminster, it did so during what was called the &ldquo;wash-up&rdquo; phase. Some  people view that Act as being overly punitive on issues regarding music  royalties and abuse of the Internet to that end. Given the controversy  surrounding it and the Divisions that took place on the Bill &mdash; I think that the  Minister&rsquo;s party colleagues may have voted against it &mdash; is his Department  making any representations to the relevant Department in Whitehall about a  review of that legislation?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: A number of aspects of that legislation give  cause for concern. We have been in contact with DCMS about a range of issues.  That contact will be ongoing.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Lottery Funding</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">11. <strong>Lord Browne </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure for his assessment of how  the lottery funding allocation, recently announced by the Secretary of State  for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport, will help offset forthcoming cuts in  the arts and sports sector.  (AQO 1520/10<a name="AQO1520/10" id="AQO1520/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure</strong>: The National Lottery is a reserved matter, and  responsibility for it rests with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.  The Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport, Jeremy Hunt,  recently announced that the Government wish to restore lottery funding to each  of the arts, sports and heritage good causes from 16&middot;7% to 20% of overall  lottery proceeds, with a corresponding reduction in funding to the Big Lottery  Fund from 50% to 40%. A DCMS consultation exercise is under way to determine  the views of all interested parties on the proposal. It is anticipated that,  overall, each of those sectors &mdash; the arts, sports and heritage &mdash; will receive  an additional &pound;50 million a year.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In Northern Ireland, that will equate to approximately &pound;1&middot;4  million each to arts and sport, which is to be welcomed. Lottery funding is  considered additional to Exchequer funding received by sport and arts. However,  although the next CSR period will be difficult, no decision has been made on  how cuts will be applied or whether the extra funding will offset them.</p>

    <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="k"></a>Public Accounts Committee Reports</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Debate resumed on motion:</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly takes note of the Public Accounts  Committee Fourth Composite Report (NIA 62/09/10R) and First Thematic Report  (NIA 65/09/10R).<span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">&mdash; [The  Chairperson of the Public Accounts Committee (Mr P Maskey).]</span></span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I will speak briefly on  transforming emergency care, which is dealt with in the composite report. That  section of the report addresses patient flows through the various components of  the healthcare system and highlights obstacles that prevent timely access to  care.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic" align="center" style="text-align:center;">(Mr Deputy  Speaker [Mr McClarty] in the Chair)</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Over the years, hospitals have struggled to reduce the  delays in A&amp;E departments that are faced by patients who must wait on  trolleys to be admitted or to be treated and discharged. I experienced that  personally at Antrim Area Hospital, where we have seen the extent of the  problem since the A&amp;E at the Mid-Ulster Hospital was closed. Despite the  best efforts of its staff, Antrim A&amp;E has not had the capacity to deal with  the influx of patients.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When we addressed the issue earlier in this session,  A&amp;E services were costing around &pound;68 million, with annual attendance  exceeding 700,000 patients. The Committee report pointed out that Health  Service trusts had made considerable progress in ensuring that the vast  majority of A&amp;E patients were treated and either discharged or admitted to  a ward within the four-hour target. The achievement of those targets is another  issue that has arisen at Antrim Area Hospital recently. In general, however,  those targets have largely been achieved by improvements in working practices  in hospitals. For example, the lack of senior clinical decision-makers in  A&amp;E departments had led to patients being admitted who would otherwise not  have been. Having a consultant admission vetting system helped to minimise  waiting time and to ensure appropriate care.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee also highlighted that A&amp;E departments  faced bottlenecks that were outside their control, particularly the lack of  inpatient beds, which is one of the most fundamental causes of waiting in  A&amp;E departments. Getting patients home more speedily creates capacity on  wards and enables ward staff to place patients from A&amp;E. Information  provided to the Public Accounts Committee by the Department of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety indicated that trusts appeared to have made  substantial headway in the timely discharge of non-complex cases from acute  hospitals.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">An improvement in discharge rates was achieved where a more  proactive approach to bed management was implemented. For example, where  discharge-focused treatment plans were established for all patients within 24  hours of admission. Although the report paints a generally upbeat picture of  A&amp;E waiting times, it draws attention to risks that needed careful  management in order to sustain performances against the Department&rsquo;s  challenging four-hour waiting time target. For instance, the Committee pointed  out that the high-level attention to performance in A&amp;E departments could  diminish in the longer term. Moreover, a focus on such a target could lead to  less attention being given to the timely completion of treatment for patients  who could be properly managed in a shorter timescale.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am aware that since we addressed this issue, new data  have emerged indicating that waiting times have begun to grow again and the  spectre of trolley waits, which I referred to earlier, has once more become a  problem. The Department&rsquo;s statistics show that, in October 2009, 87&middot;1% of  patients were treated and either discharged or admitted within four hours of  their arrival, but, by January 2010, that had fallen to 80&middot;4%. That is  disturbing and a big concern for those of us who have attended A&amp;E units  with family members or to observe the deteriorating situation. Against the  background of continuing high demand for A&amp;E services, we will need to monitor  that issue as we move into the 2010-11 Assembly session.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I move now to the issue of system testing. In recent years,  the Committee has learned much in the field of project management. One thing  that stands out is the importance of subjecting new systems to proper pilot  testing. Several high profile and important projects that the Committee  examined suffered adverse cost and performance implications due to the simple  failure to undertake such testing. It is important that testing is not  undertaken just as a box-ticking exercise. System testing must be methodical,  thorough and carried out in the proper live environment. It is also important  that short cuts are not taken with testing, no matter how important the  deadline for introducing a system, because the cost of fixing subsequent system  flaws can be substantial. We saw that with the Planning Service&rsquo;s e-PIC  project, which, as Mr Beggs said, had an overrun of &pound;7&middot;2 million and was four  years behind schedule. Representatives from the Planning Service appeared  before the Committee, and the major shortcomings by management and project  units were quite breathtaking. Apparently, expenditure on the project has yet  to stop.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee&rsquo;s &lsquo;Report on Statement of Rate Levy and  Collection 2006-07&rsquo; focused on the introduction of a new IT system. Overall,  the Committee found that short cuts were taken when implementing that complex  and large system. Specifically, the risk assessment that was undertaken for the  project was flawed and failed to recognise the risks of inadequate system  testing. In the event, the testing of the new system was not fit for purpose.  Test data that were used to check whether the system worked properly did not  test all potential eventualities and, therefore, failed to identify important  errors in the project specification. The upshot was that introducing the  project in a live environment resulted in adverse operational performance and  increased costs of &pound;3&middot;5 million, which was brought about by the need to  properly tailor the system.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In my short time on the Public Accounts Committee, I have  lost count of the number of times that I have heard civil servants say that  lessons have been learned. Failing to learn lessons seems to be a repetitive  mistake. Time and again, they say that lessons have been learned, yet they do  not seem to have been, particularly when it comes to introducing IT projects.  When an IT project is around the corner, you can automatically say that it will  probably be big-time over budget and that it will probably lag behind its completion  time.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The significant additional costs that can arise from the  need to fix flaws in systems that have not been properly tested &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member should draw his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  OK. Thank you very much.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Audit Office and the  Committee secretariat for their professionalism, dedication and assistance.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To set the context, I shall begin with a quote from the  introduction to the &lsquo;First Thematic Report&rsquo;:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Committee wished, in light of current economic  conditions, to recap on lessons learned in the back catalogue of reports it has  covered, with the aim of reaffirming crucial messages to improve Government  stewardship of public money.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I cannot say that I am surprised that more Members  are not in attendance, but I emphasis that the report and the thematic issues  on which it draws are of concern to every Department, scrutiny Committee and  Member of the Assembly. Consequently, I hope that they read the report.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The report is based on 10 studies that the Committee  undertook in conjunction with the Audit Office and seven key, major spending  Departments &mdash; Regional Development, Employment and Learning, Education, Finance  and Personnel, Health, Environment and Enterprise, Trade and Investment &mdash; and  their agencies. As I said, the report contains issues for every Member,  Committee and Department. In this time of economic recession, cutbacks and  pressure on the delivery of essential front line services, it will also be of  immense concern for the general public.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Turning to some of the report&rsquo;s content, I shall address  first the issue of post-project evaluation, which is a mandatory requirement  for all major projects and an important element in the project management process.  Therefore, the Committee is very concerned about the number of instances in  which post-project evaluations have not been completed or were not of the  required quality. Mr McGlone referred to the issue. It is particularly  important and relevant to the Committee that the evaluations are done in a  professional way and are not done just for the sake of it or to tick a box. The  purpose of a proper post-project evaluation must be to provide an open and  honest assessment of how the project was handled from start to finish and to  identify what lessons have been learned. Perhaps, most importantly, there is a  need to ensure that the results of post-project evaluations are disseminated  fully across government for future application.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Our work also covered the use of consultants. Some  reference has been made to that matter already. We examined it across a very  wide spectrum of departmental activity and concluded that post-project  evaluation was not being addressed in that context either. That meant that it  was impossible for Departments to gauge the performance of consultants before  making recurring and future appointments. We also considered that there was no  evidence that Departments were using the results of post-project evaluations to  share experience or to identify and weed out poorly performing consultants. The  importance of taking that action is highlighted by the fact that we were unable  to identify a single instance in which the results of a post-project evaluation  had been used to recover losses arising from poor consultancy service.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Overall, the Committee wishes to convey the message that  post-project evaluations must always be carried out for all significant  projects. To help to ensure that that is the case, a specific timetable for  completion of those evaluations should be set at the appraisal stage and then  adhered to. It is essential that there are formal arrangements to ensure that  lessons learnt from post-project evaluations are made available across the  public sector.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also want to speak briefly about the increasing number of  legal challenges by unsuccessful bidders against the award of public sector  contracts, which we have addressed in our composite report. Since revisions to  EU regulations in 2006, companies bidding for contracts have become more aware  of the opportunity to challenge decisions, not just at the award stage but at  all stages of the procurement process. As a result, there has been a marked  increase in demands for debriefings and a corresponding growth in the trend for  legal challenge.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Finance and Personnel has informed us  that since April 2007, 12 legal cases have been ongoing against centres of  procurement expertise. We followed up on that issue and found that successful  challenges had demonstrated weaknesses in the assessment process. Therefore,  although EU regulations provide unsuccessful bidders with the opportunity to  challenge decisions, proper adherence to procurement procedures should have  ensured that the assessment process was robust enough to prevent a number of  challenges.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In two of the cases that we reviewed that involved  framework agreements for major capital works projects with an estimated capital  value in excess of &pound;500 million, there were delays of over nine months. That is  simply unacceptable, especially in the current climate, in which there are work  shortages and layoffs in the construction industry. I hope that lessons have  been learned from those cases, and I expect DFP to work to eliminate such  weakness through the promotion of the strict adherence to procedures in all  aspects of the procurement process. Where legal challenges arise, it is  important that they are dealt with in an appropriate and expedient manner.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A sub-issue arises from that. In Workplace 2010, for  instance, we found that the cost of external legal advice was over &pound;1 million.  We deemed that to be excessive, but, when we delved further into the case, we  found that despite that expenditure, DFP made an ex gratia payment to the  unsuccessful bidder. We were told that although it was convinced that it would  win the case, it concluded, on &pound;1 million worth of legal advice, that the  balance of advantage and best value for money for the taxpayer would be  achieved by seeking to agree a settlement. We should recognise the complex  nature of procurement and accept that the EU procurement regime is subject to  ongoing legislative interpretation. However, it is vital that DFP ensures that  there is compliance with proper procedures at all times and that appropriate  in-house legal advice is available and sought to ensure an effective and  efficient procurement process in the public sector.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, the context is the economic downturn. However, any  time, good or bad, is the right time for government agencies and Departments &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member should draw his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  Any time is the right time for government agencies and Departments to  demonstrate value for money, accountability and a willingness to act according  to lessons learnt. It is time to end the complacency in the government agencies  and Departments.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel (Mr S Wilson)</strong>: This is the second Public Accounts  Committee debate that I have sat in on, and I am happy to respond to the many  worthwhile comments that have been made by Committee members and Members in the  Chamber today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will start off with a few general points. I recognise the  valuable work carried out by the Public Accounts Committee over the past 12  months; it has considered 14 Northern Ireland Audit Office reports. Its  subsequent reports have been aimed at learning lessons and improving public  services and value for money across the Northern Ireland public sector. During  the last PAC debate, I questioned the need for so many recommendations in the  Committee&rsquo;s reports. I acknowledge that note has been taken of those points and  that the number of recommendations in the various reports has been reduced and  they have become more focused, and the Chairman pointed that out. I commend the  Committee for responding to that point.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also commend the Committee for its contribution towards  improving financial management across the public sector. The fact that  Departments are now spending close to 100% of their budgets is a result of the  kind of scrutiny that they expect. It is also a good discipline, especially as  we move into tougher financial times.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I acknowledge the role that the Chairman and Deputy  Chairman have played in the Committee. I add my comments to those made by the  Chairman about the work undertaken by Kieran Donnelly, the Comptroller and  Auditor General, and his staff in the Northern Ireland Audit Office in  supporting the Committee.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the publication of the Committee&rsquo;s first thematic  report. I want to have time to consider the report in detail, but, from what I  have seen, it is a credible piece of work. It is a departure from the  Committee&rsquo;s usual style, and it is valuable at that. It brings together a  number of the Committee&rsquo;s recommendations that are of general application to  the wider public sector in one document, and I commend it for that. Mr  McLaughlin made the point that the report was designed to try to get lessons  that could be spread across all Departments, and for those lessons to be  learned.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Given that gross investment in Northern Ireland was &pound;1&middot;7  billion last year, but that that will not continue, it is important to ensure  that we get as much as we can from the spending that we deliver in coming  years. As I have said time and time again, the good times are over. Projects  that we planned to deliver will not be delivered and, therefore, we must get  maximum benefit for the public from the spending that we do have.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Before I turn to the report, I have a couple of general  observations for the Committee. First, from correspondence with officials, the  Committee will be aware of my increasing concern about its pursuit of matters  following the publication of PAC reports and the memoranda of reply. In  particular, it appears at times that the Committee considers that it has a role  to play in the day-to-day implementation of recommendations. I can understand  the Committee&rsquo;s interest and its desire to see that recommendations are  actioned, but it should recognise the role that the Comptroller and Auditor  General has to play in alerting the Committee to matters that remain  unaddressed, rather than pursuing those updates directly with Departments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, I am concerned about the way in which many of the  Committee&rsquo;s recommendations are focused less on matters of financial control  and administration and stray towards issues of policy. I understand that the  Committee will need to address, consider and clarify the policy position around  matters that are under discussion, but I ask it to restrain itself from making  recommendations in a manner that drifts towards policy. Policy is up to  Departments and to the Committees that oversee the work of Departments.  Otherwise, when assisting Departments to prepare future memoranda of reply, DFP  may consider formally rejecting individual recommendations on the basis that  they refer to matters of policy, which are matters of ministerial discretion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>:  What the Minister has said is very interesting. I hope that he does not mind if  I ask him for some examples of when the Committee has strayed into the area of  policy. I am sure that he agrees with me that the independence of the Public  Accounts Committee is the most vital thing that we have in this Parliament and  that it is something that everyone has confidence and faith in.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: That independence is important. However, it must be  exercised within the parameters of the Committee&rsquo;s responsibility, which is to  look at financial and administration matters. Policy matters are decided by  Ministers and scrutinised by Committees. I do not have all the reports in front  of me, but the Member will know that the Public Accounts Committee has made  recommendations that looked more towards whether the right policy was followed  rather than whether money was spent in an appropriate manner. That is the point  that I want to make.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: No. I have only 15 minutes and I want to respond to  the points that Members made during the debate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That is an important point about the Department&rsquo;s ability  to respond positively to PAC reports and to ensure that the Committee&rsquo;s work is  most effective during the period of financial constraint that we face.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The thematic report addresses a number of issues. First,  the Committee raised the need to take actions to protect the taxpayer. It is  very simple: everything that we do and all our combined actions must have that  aim in mind. Taxpayers have provided the Executive and the Assembly with their  hard-earned money, and we must demonstrate to them that we are using it in the  most effective way possible. PAC&rsquo;s role is to ensure that taxpayers&rsquo; money is  being used in that way in the planning, management and control of capital  projects and to examine what we do to put mistakes right. That is why the  thematic report and many of its recommendations are important.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The second issue is project planning, and that was raised  by the Chairman of the Committee, Mr McLaughlin and Dr Farry during the debate.  The report is correct when it states:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Successful delivery of&hellip; projects requires the  availability&hellip; of the right skills at the right levels.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is something that the public sector has  recognised and developed in the context of the Government&rsquo;s skills agenda. My  Department is providing a strong lead in putting in place a foundation for the  Northern Ireland Civil Service programme and project management profession. It  has appointed a head of profession and remains fully committed with the Office of  Government Commerce (OCG) on cross-government developments in the UK. That is  supported by a comprehensive learning and development programme. Over the past  two years, 500 Northern Ireland Civil Service staff have received training in  project management and a further 138 have received training in the Gateway  Review process.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Project management is a key element in the successful  completion of major projects and, in that context, the Committee&rsquo;s report  referred to the Gateway Review process. In 2009, the Central Procurement  Directorate (CPD) centre of excellence obtained OCG-authorised hub status for  the delivery of gateway reviews. That is the highest level of government  endorsement available for such actions, and was a major achievement for the  Department. In practical terms, it means that accounting officers and senior  responsible owners (SROs) in Northern Ireland receive the very highest levels  of independent assurance on their programmes and projects.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We must ensure that we have robust project management  processes that are understood and applied by all concerned. I recognise that  there have been failings in that area in the past, and that comes through in  many of the reports that have been discussed today. Key to that is the proper  application of a strong appraisal process to ensure that we get the best return  from our limited public funds. To support that, my Department published new  appraisal guidance in September 2009. It introduced new requirements for the  consideration of large capital projects. For example, DFP approval of a  strategic outline case is now required for all large projects that cost more  than &pound;20 million at their inception.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The appraisal guidance also stresses the importance of  following CPD&rsquo;s project management guidance and emphasises the use of project  management tools, such as risk registers, benefits management and post-project  evaluations. I am in firm agreement with the Committee on the issue of  post-project evaluations, the completion of which is a fundamental requirement  of all major projects. It is a tool that allows all of us to learn from our  mistakes and to share and implement good practice throughout the public sector.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will try to race through some of the points that were  raised. Mr Beggs and Mr McGlone raised the statement of rate levy and  collection. My Department has made solid progress against all the  recommendations in the Committee&rsquo;s report that fall to the agency to implement.  Land and Property Services makes quarterly progress reports to the Finance and  Personnel Committee. Current guidance on programme and project management  addresses the issues that were raised by the Committee and highlights good  practice in project and risk management. Central Procurement Directorate  evaluated the use of the Gateway Review process. We took advice from OCG in  relation to the project and assessed the lessons learned. Those were  incorporated into the comprehensive annual publication of the lessons arising  from gateway reviews, which has been circulated and reported to the DFP audit  and risk committee.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A number of Members mentioned the Planning Service and, in  particular, e-PIC. DOE accepts that certain aspects of the e-PIC project could  have been handled more effectively. However, it can confirm that robust  programme management arrangements are now in place, including mechanisms to  enable the early identification, escalation and resolution of any issues of  concern. It is on that basis that additional moneys have been made available to  complete the e-PIC project. There is now a dedicated senior manager with  experience in information and communication technology and a proven track  record of successful project delivery. It is hoped that those measures will ensure  the project&rsquo;s successful delivery in 2010.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Beggs also referred to the upgrade of the Belfast to  Bangor railway line. I understand that a significant number of welcome  improvements have been made to the governance and control arrangements in the  transport holding company and in Translink. Since March 2007, Translink has  been recognised as a centre of procurement expertise. It has documented  programme management procedures, including contract management, contract  variation and risk management.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Dallat raised the issue of surplus lands in the PFI and  pathfinder projects. The majority of the recommendations emanating from the  report were of a general nature and were, therefore, addressed by my Department.  Following the publication of the Committee&rsquo;s report and the memorandum reply,  my Department brought a number of the Committee&rsquo;s recommendations to the  attention of every Department, because there are lessons to be learned for all  Departments. The key message is that, when public bodies decide to dispose of  surplus assets, value for money must be clearly demonstrated in each decision that  is taken. That will be a prerequisite to DFP approval, when required. We will  want proof of value for money to be incorporated into business cases.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Dallat also raised the issue of consultants. It is an  important issue, because we spend &pound;42 million on consultants across all  Departments. In 2007-08, DFP reintroduced annual compliance reports from  Departments. Those provide us with an overview of the extent and nature of  consultancy expenditure throughout Northern Ireland. The Department has issued  revised guidelines to reinforce the need to produce business cases, tender  competitively and carry out post-project evaluations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are a number of other issues, but you will call me to  order in a moment, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Minister to draw his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I thank Members for their contributions to what has  been an interesting debate.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I call the Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and Personnel,  Mr Paul Maskey.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Public Accounts Committee</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann  Comhairle. I thank all Members who took part in the debate. I am delighted to  have produced our first thematic report, which will help to focus Members&rsquo;  thoughts as they prepare for tight budget scrutiny and recession planning in  their Committees and in Departments. The Committee anticipates that the  Government will reinforce the value of the public audit and scrutiny process,  which is central to democratic accountability.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that the Minister will find merit in the lessons  that the report articulates as he looks forward to making difficult decisions  in setting the Budget in these hard times. Undoubtedly, he will have in mind  areas that could benefit from the improved project management practice that we  promote. He will also have in mind ideas for where he could aim resources that  are saved by implementation of the guidance.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will not go through every word of every Member who spoke,  but I will summarise what was said and add some thoughts of my own. The Deputy  Chairperson, Mr Roy Beggs, talked about the lessons that can be learned about  IT systems. One of the core themes that almost every Member mentioned was that  lessons are to be learned. In some cases, lessons have been learned; in others,  they have not. Ministers and Departments need to take on board the lessons and  move forward with them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Roy Beggs spoke about the report on the upgrade of the  Belfast to Bangor railway line. He said that the speed limit was intended to be  90 miles per hour but there were so many stops on the line that the trains were  unable to get up to that speed so the specification that was issued was wrong.  Some of the issues that the Committee dealt with were schoolboy errors that  should not have been made. The Public Accounts Committee tries to draw out  important lessons in its inquiries that Departments must take on board to  ensure that mistakes are not made again.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Roy Beggs and Patsy McGlone mentioned e-PIC, which is not  yet complete. At the time of our inquiry, it was four years behind schedule and  about 130% over budget, yet some senior civil servants in the Department were  paid bonuses. We have to ask why that happened. It is completely wrong.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Many Members mentioned value for money, which is one of the  core aspects that most of the Committee&rsquo;s inquiries focus on. John Dallat said  that the use of consultants usually represents bad value for money for  taxpayers. If that is the case, Departments need to look closely at the value  of consultants. John also said that the taxpayer benefited not one brass penny  from the sale of land that was part of the pathfinder project.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Stephen Farry was impressed by the volume of the  Committee&rsquo;s work. It is down to the determination, hard work and commitment of  Committee members, which I mentioned in my opening remarks. It is also down to  the commitment and hard work of the Committee&rsquo;s secretariat staff, who are  sitting to my right. They work very hard, and their work in the Committee&rsquo;s  structure keeps us sane and keeps us right. I thank all of them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">David Hilditch and Barry McElduff mentioned DCAL issues,  including malpractice and fraud at the Sports Institute NI, where &pound;75,000 was  squandered and embezzled. That is taking money away from some important issues  and themes that should be taking place there. It is very poor form that &pound;75,000  has been taken away from that programme. However, that was allowed to happen,  and, to this day, some of that money, according to Barry McElduff, has not even  been returned to the Department. That needs to be examined.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We considered suspected fraud in the Belfast Education and  Library Board and produced a report. Throughout the city of Belfast, libraries  are being closed. However, money was being paid to contractors even though work  had not been done. That had been started but was being carried out in a bad  manner. Although some of it was not even passed by the clerk of works, money  was paid. That highlights the importance of some of our reports. I hope that  those reports can help all Members of the Assembly &mdash; Mitchel McLaughlin pointed  this out &mdash; as well as Ministers and Departments to move forward in more  positive way and learn from the mistakes that have been made.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In his opening remarks, Patsy McGlone majored on the  transformation of emergency care. He mentioned some personal experiences with  Antrim Area Hospital. We all have experience of visits to hospitals and of  family members being in hospital, and we see the work and the commitment of  hospital staff. However, he mentioned waiting times, and I hope that some of  the Committee&rsquo;s recommendations reduced those times. However, in recent times,  some waiting times have started to creep up again. That is bad for people who  are waiting to go into hospital.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister mentioned a number of issues and said that the  Committee had, perhaps, strayed into some Departments&rsquo; policy arenas. I am  willing to sit down with the Minister if he can outline where we strayed into  policy. Throughout his 15-minute contribution, he did not once mention where we  strayed into policy. If that is the case, say it. If it is not the case, do not  say it. I am willing to sit down with the Minister and with secretariat staff  at any stage. We met staff from the Department of Finance and Personnel to  discuss public relations and press release issues. We managed to resolve some  of those issues, and, therefore, I am willing to sit down with the Minister and  with secretariat staff at any stage to address those issues.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Does the Chairman agree that, if the Committee sees that public money is not  being well spent, it is our duty to raise that issue? If that is a policy  matter, it may have to go through another Committee or through a Minister.  However, it would be foolish of the Committee to say nothing if it is convinced  that money is being wasted.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Public Accounts Committee</strong>: I agree wholeheartedly with the Deputy  Chairperson. The Committee makes an important contribution and works hard to  ensure that we do not stray into policy. We know that the remit of our  Committee is to ensure that value for money is achieved. The Minister said that  the good times were over and mentioned last year&rsquo;s figure of &pound;1&middot;7 billion  gross. That is not necessarily true. Much as our eyes are opened wide by some  inquiries, there are areas where we could save money and use it more  effectively. If that money is used more effectively, whatever budget is left  can, we hope, stretch much further. That is an important aspect.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am glad that the Minister welcomed and commended the  Committee. We have recognised the important work that his Department and all  other Departments have taken forward on the basis of some of our  recommendations. I welcome the fact that their staff have been trained in  project management. Mitchel McLaughlin&rsquo;s comments majored on post-project  evaluation, and I hope that there will be some training in that area. Mitchel  talked about the lessons learned. In fact, every Member bar one mentioned it.  We must never forget that, because it is an important step and it is something  that we need to take forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister said that the Department has made great  progress with the Committee&rsquo;s recommendations. We take our recommendations very  seriously, but I appreciate that, since last September&rsquo;s debate, we have  reduced the number of recommendations, and we see the benefits of that.  Sometimes it takes a challenge during a debate to point that out. Therefore, we  have been more effective with regard to the number of recommendations, as well  as the thematic report. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comments on what can be  learned throughout the whole process. I know that he has had only a quick look  at the report, but I am sure that he will take it away with him, and it will be  some bedtime reading for him tonight. It might be better than some of his other  bedtime reading. Nevertheless, it is an important step forward.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: It might put me to sleep.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Public Accounts Committee</strong>: It might put him out early, but he can  have a good read at it anyway. It is important that all Departments take a look  at the thematic report and the composite report that we have produced and learn  lessons from the Committee&rsquo;s recommendations to ensure that best practice is  brought forward. That is what it is all about.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It was mentioned earlier that taxpayers can see the benefit  of the Public Accounts Committee acting on their behalf. That is a very  important step. We are involved in an important initiative, and all the  Committee members and secretariat staff are very committed and dedicated to  ensuring that government works and that there is value for money.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It would be remiss of me not to mention Kieran Donnelly, who  is the Comptroller and Auditor General, and the team that work for him, because  it is a very important piece of work. It would also be remiss of me not to  mention the Treasury Officer of Accounts for DFP. We have a good working  relationship with him. It is important to explore other ways of working things  out, regardless of whether the Minister thinks that we are straying into the  policy arena. Let us explore and let us have that conversation, because I think  that it can be beneficial not only to our Committee but to all Departments. I  look forward to meeting the Minister on that issue.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: For those who did not spot the deliberate mistake, I should say  that Mr Maskey is Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, not the Finance  and Personnel Committee, as I indicated earlier.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
