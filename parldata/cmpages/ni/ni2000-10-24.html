                was Mr&nbsp;Ian Paisley Jnr, and I ask the Member to withdraw

                First Minister and the Deputy First Minister that they wish to
                make a statement on the Programme for Government.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister (Mr Trimble):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With permission, Mr Speaker, we would like to
                make a statement on the draft Programme for Government on behalf
                of the Executive. In accordance with paragraph&nbsp;20 of strand
                one of the Belfast Agreement the Executive agreed a draft
                programme on 16&nbsp;October, incorporating the agreed budget
                and linking this to policies and programmes. We are therefore
                laying this Programme for Government before the Assembly for
                scrutiny and for future approval, after examination in the
                Committees, on a cross- community basis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today’s statement is the start of a process
                of consultation. The statement focuses on the principles
                underlying the programme rather than on the detail of its
                contents, although we will say something on the content later in
                the statement. We also wish to set out proposals on how we might
                take forward our discussion on the draft programme, how these
                proposals relate to the Assembly’s scrutiny of the draft
                budget, and how these two processes can be brought together in
                the new year in a final agreed document. The letter to the
                Speaker, which Members received last week, explained how the
                Programme for Government and the budget could be progressed
                through the stages of Assembly scrutiny and debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Members are aware, this is an important
                task, which we will return to each year. In future years, with
                less pressure on time and with more experience, I believe we can
                create a longer cycle, allowing more time for consideration and
                reflection. This year, inevitably, we have all faced severe time
                constraints, and we are very grateful for the Assembly’s
                assistance in this process.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The document is a first approach to the
                important task of linking the work of Departments and agencies,
                creating a new sense of priority and direction. We believe we
                have started to map out a new agreed direction addressing the
                real problems that Northern Ireland faces and creating more
                accountable government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We believe that this process is unique —
                certainly in the history of Northern Ireland — in producing
                the equivalent of the Queen’s Speech and a multi-party
                manifesto rolled into one. It is a comprehensive document
                covering the aims, priorities and intended actions of the new
                Administration, and it sets out the context for the draft
                budget. Transparency is one of the watchwords, and, as in
                Scotland and Wales, the public will now be in a good position to
                see, with some precision, what this Administration is about. As
                we develop the programme with targets for the implementation of
                actions, that transparency will be extended to allow people to
                assess our effectiveness in delivering the programme. We believe
                this is a first in shining new light into the darker recesses of
                government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This document, however, is not the last word.
                It reflects the best efforts of the Executive and officials in
                the time available. We have necessarily made choices, sometimes
                difficult choices, to fit our aspirations within the resources
                available. The last word, however, resides in this Assembly.
                This draft programme is the start of a phase of consultation
                with the Assembly and of subsequent refinement. We will also
                seek the views of other organisations wishing to contribute to
                our future to produce a final document for the Assembly’s
                approval.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is necessarily a complex document. It
                contains over 230 actions, set out in over 30 sections. The
                majority of these actions are covered by the budget proposals
                for next year, which, following consultation, will need the
                Assembly’s final agreement by December. As we explained in our
                letter, we therefore propose that we should hold a longer debate
                in mid-November to receive the Assembly’s broad views on the
                programme, once the Committees have had an initial opportunity
                to consider the document. In particular, the Assembly may wish
                to give its view on whether the programme provides an
                appropriate basis for the budget. If Committees have views on
                the programme and on the many specific actions included in it,
                which have implications for expenditure in 2001/02, we would ask
                that these are fitted into their consideration of the budget. A
                revised budget will then be presented to the Assembly and voted
                on before Christmas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As individual Committees scrutinise the
                programme, and also consider their budget, Ministers will be
                able to explain the details of their actions more fully. The
                Assembly will have until January to let the Executive have its
                views on the wider programme. We will then consolidate revisions
                to the budget with those to the Programme for Government and
                will present a consolidated programme to the Assembly for final
                agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Programme for Government is central to
                co-operation between the different parties to the agreement in
                Northern Ireland. Through their Pledge of Office, all Ministers
                must participate with their colleagues in the preparation of a
                Programme for Government, and co-operate within the framework of
                that programme when it is agreed in the Executive Committee and
                endorsed by the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The document therefore provides an open
                statement, to be democratically agreed through the Assembly, of
                the policies and actions that bind all Ministers together for
                the better government of Northern Ireland. It will become the
                joint agreed declaration of policy of this Administration, which
                all members of the Administration will need to support. In turn,
                the public can have a clear understanding of what they can
                expect from the new Administration. After almost 30 years of
                unaccountable direct rule, it will be a contract between the
                Government and the public.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that this programme can be of value to
                other organisations — the voluntary sector, business groups,
                trade unions and others who also have an important role to play
                in the future of Northern Ireland. I hope that this programme,
                as we develop it in the coming months and years, will help to
                provide a focus for the future of Northern Ireland, helping all
                to work together effectively.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The role of the Government, in many fields,
                is to set out a framework incorporating vision and direction
                within which others can act. This programme is designed to
                provide such a framework. The end result must be greater trust
                and understanding between all levels of government and the
                public. That will be essential for securing peace and deepening
                our democracy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also need to create an agreed sense of
                priority about our overall policies to enable us to ensure that
                all Departments contribute to that agreed vision and direction.
                The Administration is not made up of 11 separate entities, each
                run by individual Ministers looking after totally discrete
                policy areas. That would lead to inefficiency and frustration.
                We have all dealt with constituency cases in the past where
                resources were poorly spent, co-ordination was poor and
                different Departments were at loggerheads.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The public, frankly, do not care which
                Department solves the problems they are seeking to be answered.
                What they want is good quality services and effective policies,
                meeting real needs. For this reason our key policy areas are
                cross-cutting in nature, requiring different Departments and
                agencies to co-operate for the benefit of the public. In many
                cases it is only when a number of Departments get together,
                agree a common vision and set out policies which complement one
                another that we achieve the significant gains that are needed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a first step in achieving joined-up
                government we devote a significant part of this Programme for
                Government to setting out priority policy areas, broadly
                defined, where we wish Departments to work together to improve
                society. The Deputy First Minister will elaborate on the nature
                and content of those priorities in a moment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To develop these priorities, the Executive is
                considering establishing a limited number of sub-committees to
                take forward policy work on key cross-cutting policy areas so
                that the relevant Ministers can work together to review the
                effectiveness of policies and, where necessary, adopt new
                innovative approaches. The work of developing cross-cutting
                priority areas will be assisted by the evolving role of a new
                feature in managing public spending. These are the Executive
                programme funds. These will be managed directly by the Executive
                as opposed to being pre-allocated to Departments. They will seek
                to assist the development of new policies and programmes and new
                improved services as well as dealing with major infrastructure
                projects.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main policy areas we propose that they
                should cover are: social inclusion and community regeneration in
                order to combat poverty and support communities; service
                modernisation to promote efficiency and innovation within the
                public sector; new directions to encourage the development of
                innovative new policies tackling important areas; infrastructure
                and capital renewal to support the modernisation of our
                increasingly dated transport and other infrastructure in
                partnership with the private sector; and finally — but by no
                means least important — to support and protect children in
                need and young people at risk.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The focus of these Executive programme funds
                will be on policy and service innovation, on tackling weakness
                in infrastructure and on ensuring effective targeting of
                programmes on groups and areas. Proposals will either be of
                major regional importance or cross- cutting in their nature. The
                funds should in many cases help lever in other resources, from a
                number of other Departments or even elsewhere, to create new
                funding bases for cross-cutting policies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the first year of this programme, starting
                in April 2001, the Executive proposes that £16 million be
                devoted to these funds. With the experience of the first year of
                this initiative behind us, we then propose to rapidly increase
                the value of these funds to £100 million in 2002-2003 and £200
                million in 2003-2004.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One aspect I wish to stress in the Programme
                for Government is the desire to concentrate resources on real
                needs in Northern Ireland. We have to be realistic. We have to
                make clear the challenges we face. We have to make clear that we
                will not solve all deep-rooted problems overnight. It has not
                been either possible or sensible to attempt to make all of the
                fundamental changes we wish in the first few months of this new
                Administration. Major changes need to be carefully planned and
                thought out. That is why the programme contains a significant
                number of major policy reviews which will influence the
                direction of policy in important ways in future years.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.45 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will not list all of these reviews. There
                are too many to do so briefly, but I will mention a few. There
                are ongoing reviews of the structure of selection, of secondary
                education and also of student finance. There are also reviews of
                transport strategy and, most importantly, of road safety, which
                it is hoped will maintain a reduction in deaths and injuries on
                our roads. We will introduce a review of public administration
                to ensure, among other things, that the costs of administration
                are minimised. In addition, a number of new strategies are to be
                developed, including those for public health, sustainable
                development and energy markets.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As these reviews are completed and considered
                by both individual Ministers and the Executive, policy in
                Northern Ireland will increasingly be tailored to our unique
                circumstances and to reflect the needs of our people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While we have seen a significant increase in
                finances, those finances are still limited. A budget increase of
                4·7% in real terms provides some room to manoeuvre, but it does
                not enable us to do all that we would have wished. We must still
                make choices. Making choices is not easy. It requires freeing up
                resources from aspects of expenditure considered less essential
                to allow us to do more in those areas of policy we view as
                particularly pressing. Increased flexibility of this sort
                requires a sea change in the culture of departmental
                administration, and this we are determined to achieve.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As an important start in this direction we
                intend that the Programme for Government will include a set of
                targets associated with the specific actions listed under each
                priority area. These targets will be incorporated in public
                service agreements, which themselves form a contract between
                individual Departments and the Executive as a whole. This will
                clarify what services are provided for the resources received.
                Public service agreements are new to Northern Ireland. They will
                introduce a culture change in the delivery of services, a
                culture change focusing not only on inputs into Departments but
                also on the outputs of services to the public.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The detail of the public service agreements
                will be developed between now and January 2001 and will be made
                available to the Assembly to consider in a consolidated
                programme in advance of the final debate in February. Our aim
                will be to develop the scope of public service agreements in
                future years which, in turn, will develop accountable and
                efficient government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course, if we had more money, we could
                have achieved more. We do not believe the Barnett formula that
                determines the funds available to this Administration is fair.
                The formula strictly applied does not take account of above
                average needs in allocating additional funds. As a result,
                Northern Ireland is falling behind the rest of the United
                Kingdom in terms of increases to expenditure, even if we are
                still ahead in terms of per capita spending unadjusted for need.
                We fought hard in the summer and won certain concessions on
                this, and we have made clear to the Treasury that we will
                continue to fight for change. However, it must be realised that
                we will not resolve the Barnett formula in the short term.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those are some general considerations
                affecting the Programme for Government. The Deputy First
                Minister will now outline the content of the programme.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister (Mr Mallon):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">May I also thank all of my ministerial
                Colleagues, their Departments and their officials for their work
                on the Programme for Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In developing this programme the Executive
                looked at the key challenges which we face and where needs were
                greatest. As we analysed each problem we also considered how to
                work together to create real change in both the short term and
                the long term.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first obvious challenge is that here in
                Northern Ireland we have a divided society emerging from thirty
                years of conflict. The Good Friday Agreement gives us the
                necessary framework and principles, and creates the real
                prospect of enduring peace and stability. We will build on this
                through the Programme for Government. In the Executive we are
                developing a capacity to work together and have evolved a broad
                consensus on the importance of equality, human rights, social
                justice and culture diversity. However, we do not underestimate
                the challenges ahead.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are deep divisions in our society, with
                high levels of distrust and segregation in housing, in
                education, and socially. We must develop approaches which help
                to resolve conflict. We must promote partnership and trust right
                across the community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There also remain considerable inequalities
                within our society, particularly in unemployment, which must be
                addressed. There are also significant levels of deprivation,
                high long-term unemployment and high dependency on social
                security benefit. We must address urban deprivation and
                recognise that our rural areas face major challenges.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All of these challenges point to a priority
                area for action, which we describe as &quot;growing as a
                community&quot;. It covers not just equality, human rights and
                the needs of victims, but also tackles poverty and social
                disadvantage. We also place a particular emphasis on the needs
                of children, the renewal of our most disadvantaged
                neighbourhoods, and on tackling divisions through improved
                community relations, and respecting and celebrating cultural
                diversity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a massive canvas on which Departments
                must work together. We will all see in the Programme for
                Government how we have examined each area and set out over 60
                different actions for the coming year, including areas where we
                will start to develop new policies. Some of our new commitments
                include implementing all equality schemes, as approved by the
                Equality Commission; achieving all the targets and actions in
                the new targeting social need (TSN) plans and developing them
                annually; reviewing under-representation in the senior Civil
                Service; providing over 500 places for work-related programmes
                for the disabled and adapting 1,500 houses to meet their needs;
                a new grant scheme for households suffering from fuel poverty; a
                taskforce on unemployability to reduce long-term unemployment;
                and proposals to introduce free travel on public transport for
                older people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive programme social
                inclusion/community regeneration fund and the EU structural
                funds will play a major role in support of this priority,
                assisting action against poverty and supporting community
                measures in both urban and rural settings, as well as actions on
                community relations and cultural diversity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second area that we see as a priority is
                working for a healthier people. We have the third youngest
                population of all the regions in the European Union, together
                with a growing elderly population. Overall, our health record
                has not been good. Death rates from coronaries and some cancers
                are among the highest in western Europe. Our young men are
                likely to die early due to accidents, and we have one of the
                highest rates of teenage pregnancy. We are concerned by the
                links between poor health and low incomes, and will target
                resources accordingly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course modernising and improving hospital
                and primary care services are important responses, and the
                financial resources — an extra £150 million — have been
                given to them, but the major new focus of the Executive in this
                area will be on tackling the causes of ill health, reducing
                preventable disease, ill health and health inequalities by a
                cross-cutting public health strategy combining social
                intervention and education, and ensuring that factors such as
                the quality of our water, our air and our recreational
                facilities all support health.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In short, while the Department of Health,
                Social Services and Public Safety has a major role in working
                for a healthier people, at least six other Departments have
                important roles to play.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some 40 actions are set out in the Programme
                for Government in support of this priority. They include work to
                reduce waiting lists and meet winter pressures; restrictions on
                tobacco advertising; a new road-safety strategy; the provision
                of up to 50 extra specialised staff for the cancer services; an
                additional 230 community-care packages; and measures to reduce
                the misuse of drugs and alcohol.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We will use our proposed Executive Programme
                children’s fund to provide support for children in need and
                young people at risk. We will increase the coverage of the Sure
                Start programme in areas of social disadvantage from 11,000 to
                16,000.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The third priority area for action is
                investing in education and skills. Our young people are an
                important focus for attention. However, with high rates of adult
                illiteracy, and with the real need for reskilling throughout our
                working lives, this priority is relevant to all of us. The basic
                right to education opens opportunities for the individual;
                education and training are key to our development as a society
                and economy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our education system is doing well for many
                of our young people. However, there are major problems of low
                achievement and underachievement that have to be addressed.
                Among the existing workforce there are too many people with few
                or no formal qualifications.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are 27 specific action points covered
                in this priority area. They include the review of selection and
                student support, which will have a long-term impact on the
                structures of our system and on equality of opportunity. There
                are also actions with early effect, such as an extra 500
                training places in areas of skills shortages and an extra 200
                undergraduate places on top of the 4,200 places planned by 2004.
                We aim to fulfil the target of providing one year of pre-school
                education for every child by 2002-03.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fourth priority area for action is
                securing a competitive economy. A modern competitive economy is
                central to creating an inclusive society, providing opportunity
                for all with new knowledge-based skilled jobs. We must face the
                challenge of global competition and tackle our over-dependence
                on declining or slow- growing industries.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Already there are signs of success. Since
                December the IDB has promoted 7,100 new jobs — 3,000 more than
                in the previous year. Manufacturing output has increased by over
                7% since last year. Unemployment, at 40,100, is at its lowest
                level since 1984. Investors and business want to see stability
                and the success of the institutions to continue those trends.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In developing this priority we have taken a
                wide view of economic development, covering education, skills
                and infrastructure policy, promoting enterprise, innovation and
                creativity, and working to make Northern Ireland more attractive
                to inward investors and visitors.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If our businessmen and women are to succeed
                in a tough global economy and are to create the employment we
                need, then, as Government, we have to have to do everything we
                can to give them the right environment and the right cost
                structure to compete. That is why improved planning, good
                quality transport and telecommunications will be crucial. That
                is why good quality business services and support for research
                and development will be key. Through the programme all
                Departments will have to work effectively together to plan the
                new infrastructure and services for the needs of business and
                the public.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In many areas of our infrastructure public
                investment under direct rule was inadequate. We now have to
                tackle serious problems in areas such as roads, rail, water and
                sewerage. The same lack of investment is found in some of our
                education and health estate, also with damaging effects on our
                society and economy. The new executive programme infrastructure
                renewal fund will help us support strategic projects using,
                where possible, public and private partnerships. We regard
                infrastructure as a means to a policy end, not as an end in
                itself.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.00 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under this priority we will also give a
                special focus to the regeneration of the rural economy in which
                our agriculture industry plays a key part. Its development and
                diversification are vital to the survival of many communities.
                However, access to other types of employment — to second
                incomes — will also be important. The development of our rural
                towns must be carefully considered; tourism in rural areas has
                got to be enhanced. The development of public services must take
                into account the needs of all rural areas. All relevant policies
                will therefore be rural-proofed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, sustainability must be a key
                concern. We have set out targets and programmes to protect and
                enhance our environment and to integrate environmental concerns
                into policy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have outlined 49 actions under this
                priority. Specific actions include giving Northern Ireland a
                world-class telecommunications infrastructure with the necessary
                broadband capacity, access and cost; becoming a world-class
                centre for e-commerce; exploiting the potential of the
                North/South trade and business, tourism and waterways bodies and
                preparing an all-island energy market strategy; agreeing and
                implementing regional development and regional transport
                strategies; eliminating the backlog in planning applications by
                2002; sustaining 50 high-tech, value-added, new start-up
                companies each year; and implementing the beef quality
                initiative to increase the number of clean cattle to 180,000 per
                year by 2006-07. These are examples of the sustained effort that
                we propose in this and other areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our fifth priority area for action relates to
                developing North/South, East/West and international relations.
                Since devolution the role of dealing with other Administrations
                has fallen to the Executive. We intend to play this role to the
                full. We will use the structures set in place by the agreement
                to the maximum benefit of Northern Ireland, and to contribute to
                the development of our neighbours. The Programme for Government
                will be an important tool of communication in this process.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The North/South Ministerial Council, and the
                implementation bodies and areas of co-operation, must continue
                to deliver tangible benefits. Immediate tasks include completion
                of cross-cutting studies on barriers to North/South mobility —
                living and working — and on enhancing the competitiveness of
                the two economies and using the present round of European
                funding to promote North/South co-operation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the East/West structures the Executive
                will be leading work on transport issues and pursuing the fuel
                tax issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of the things that will need to be done
                are outside our control. Some issues — taxation, for example
                — are not devolved, while others are decided at European or
                international level. We will develop effective links in the
                European institutions by establishing an office in Brussels in
                the coming months, and in North America — so important for
                investment — we will better co-ordinate our activities to take
                full account of successful devolution. We will pay special
                attention to improving our image internationally with, for
                example, strategies to secure high-profile sporting and cultural
                events for Northern Ireland and to help support Belfast’s bid
                to become the European City of Culture 2008.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the final section of the programme we have
                set out key internal governmental issues that we must tackle if
                we are to create the quality of public services that the public
                needs. We will modernise, through the e-government programme and
                work on the continuous improvement of services, with support
                from the new Executive programme funds. We will examine
                decentralisation and public procurement policy, taking account
                of a number of factors, including their impact on equality of
                opportunity. We will seek to work as a team with local
                government, the social partners, and the voluntary and community
                sector.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to explore new ways of financing
                public services to enable us to tackle the poor infrastructure
                we inherited from direct rule and to ensure that all public
                sector services are used to cut down on fraud. In this draft
                programme, we have made some difficult choices, allocating
                scarce resources between competing priorities. But ultimately it
                is the Assembly that will decide. Out of it will come a better
                programme, with a stronger democratic mandate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The key point is that these choices are being
                made here, through the democratic process, and that a local,
                accountable Government is heading the change. The hand-over of
                the draft programme is a defining moment in the life of these
                institutions. Let us not waste the opportunity we have been
                given to write our own script and to truly serve the people who
                have elected us.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, on behalf of the Executive, we
                commend the draft Programme for Government to the Assembly.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will know that a one-hour limit for
                questions on a statement is given in Standing Orders. Members
                and Ministers should be as succinct as possible because a very

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the First Minister and Deputy First
                Minister for their statement. This is the first plan for a
                devolved Government here in 25 years. If devolution is to make a
                positive difference — as it can do — it should achieve
                joined-up government. What criteria will be used to allocate the
                so-called Executive programme funds?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member mentioned that this is the first
                programme for the administration of Northern Ireland that has
                been drawn up by elected representatives of Northern Ireland for
                nearly three decades. That is a very significant achievement,
                about which we should be very pleased and proud. I hope that the
                community appreciates that, for the first time in 25 years,
                Northern Ireland’s elected representatives are ahead of the
                game in making decisions and choices.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive programme funds are a
                significant new development — the Executive will handle
                collectively a significant and increasing amount of resources.
                This will help enormously to enhance the collective
                responsibility of the Administration. We are proposing five
                different programme funds, and the amount of money allocated to
                each is, I must emphasise, merely indicative. We are feeling our
                way on this, but we hope that the programme funds will become
                major levers for change, particularly in years two, three and
                thereafter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to way the programme funds will
                operate and the criteria to be applied, a number of principles
                will govern the distribution of money. We want to promote policy
                and service innovation, to tackle weaknesses in infrastructure
                and to target the areas, groups and individuals in greatest
                need. Consequently, the programme funds will be used to support
                the most important programmes and projects which will assist the
                development of actions across Departments or provide resources
                to support an individual departmental activity. The funds should
                help lever in other resources from other Departments, or
                elsewhere, and, I hope, will create new funding bases for
                cross-cutting programmes.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Hendron:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate the First Minister and Deputy
                First Minister on the production of this historic programme for
                Government. I am very pleased with what I have heard.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are major inequalities in our society:
                in health, in education and among the massive number of
                unemployed people. The principle of targeting social need (TSN)
                is very important to Members and to the people of Northern
                Ireland. Bearing this in mind, what action has been taken to
                ensure that new targeting social need is reflected in the
                Programme for Government?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Assemblyman for his question. New
                TSN has underpinned and informed the Programme for Government
                and has shaped its priorities. Ministers agreed that it was
                particularly important that the new TSN action plans be
                integrated into the Programme for Government. For that reason,
                in the draft programme all Departments have committed themselves
                to implementing all of the actions and targets in their
                soon-to-be-published new TSN action plans. These plans will be
                reviewed each year, and there will annual reports on progress
                with the full evaluation of policy in the year 2002.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The draft programme also explicitly mentions
                many key new TSN actions and targets. These include building
                socio-economic disadvantage into the funding formula for the
                resource element of the new general exchequer grant for district
                councils; delivery of comprehensive regeneration strategies for
                the most disadvantaged communities in our two major cities; and
                establishing partnership between the community, voluntary,
                private and public sectors in the most disadvantaged areas in
                the form of a neighbourhood regeneration taskforce. A further
                target is to ensure that health and public services boards
                implement new TSN action plans to tackle inequalities in the
                administration of resources to the victims of accidents,
                cancers, circulatory disease and infant mortality.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">New TSN will also be considered in policy
                reviews such as the review of decentralisation of Civil Service
                accommodation. Particular regard will also be had to new TSN in
                the allocation of executive programme funds. The amount of money
                available from these funds is projected to rise quickly from
                £16 million in the year 2001-2002, to £200 million by
                2003-2004. Ensuring that these funds advance new TSN aims and
                objectives is therefore of particular importance. One of the
                focuses of the funds will ever be to ensure effective targeting
                of programmes at the individuals, groups and areas in greatest
                needs.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Programme for Government has a lot of
                meaningless statements in it, and once one removes a lot of the
                verbiage and refines the details, one finds that the First
                Minister’s scriptwriters have failed to cover up the
                all-Ireland nature of the current process. I see one North/South
                body after another, whether it be language, health, road safety,
                tourism, trade, co-operation, strategic communications — the
                list goes on and on.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also note that bureaucracy has been
                increased rather than decreased here. Why have quangos not been
                dealt with? We have now found that a new North/South Civic Forum
                is to be set up.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Who will monitor the Office of the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister? Will that be allocated
                to the Committee of the Centre or to a variety of Statutory
                Committees?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member has mentioned three different
                points. His first point is wholly erroneous, so I think things
                have to be put into perspective. There are of course several
                areas of North/South co-operation which are significant and
                which will bring practical benefits; we have already mentioned a
                few of those. I will give one example; the encouragement of an
                all-Ireland energy market is extremely important to our efforts
                to bring down energy costs in Northern Ireland, and that is
                critical for Northern Ireland industry. That will be of
                significant benefit to us, so instead of having a knee-jerk
                reaction to this, Members should look at things on their merit
                and put them into context.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not know if the Member actually
                researched this, but the expenditure of the Northern Ireland
                budget on North/South co-operation next year is £11million. Now
                put that in the context of £5·5billion of total expenditure. I
                think that says it all.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to quangos, the Member will have
                heard reference to the review of public administration, which we
                hope to get underway before long. It is within that context that
                the issue of quangos will be addressed. We want to examine
                public administration, and we want to see what can be done to
                make the system more efficient, both in terms of the delivery of
                services and of the cost involved. It is axiomatic that
                throughout the period of direct rule there was a growth of
                quangos. Some were needed, and others were simply set up to fill
                the democratic deficit.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.15 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That democratic deficit is now filled by this
                institution and, consequently, it is appropriate that we should
                look at the quangos concerned. On the question of the scrutiny
                of matters that fall within the remit of the Department of the
                Centre, I hope that the Member and his Colleagues on that
                Committee will be more effective in scrutinising the Department
                than he has been in addressing questions here.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Molloy:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. This
                is the first time since partition that Unionists, Nationalists
                and Republicans have come together to put forward a Programme
                for Government for administering the Six Counties, for
                co-operation with the rest of the island and for building an
                all-Ireland economy. In light of this, do the First Minister and
                the Deputy First Minister, on behalf of the Executive, agree
                that the eradication of the community differential in
                unemployment between Catholics and Protestants is an urgent
                priority? Will they make a statement on what specific actions
                and commitments there are in the Programme for Government to
                tackle this disparity?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree that this Programme for Government is
                highly significant as being the line of demarcation between a
                past which is well gone and a future that we all want to build
                together. I agree that tackling the unemployment differential
                must be a priority for this Administration. Indeed, the
                agreement itself commits us to the goal of progressively
                eliminating the differential in unemployment rates between the
                two communities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Programme for Government explicitly
                recognises the importance of tackling community differentials,
                and specific measures in it should contribute to the elimination
                of the differential. These include New Deal, lifelong learning
                and the welfare reform programme, which will give people the
                skills and incentives to get jobs and escape the cycle of
                deprivation; the New TSN action plans, which will be reviewed
                annually; and the establishment of a task force to reduce
                long-term unemployment and increase employability. There will
                also be new training programmes for adults with basic literacy
                and numeracy problems; an additional 500 training and further
                education places in skill shortage areas; and regeneration
                strategies for the most disadvantaged communities in the two
                major cities — something which should not be underestimated.
                Also included are neighbourhood regeneration task forces to
                reduce disadvantage in the most deprived urban areas, and the
                implementation of the equality schemes of public authorities in
                Northern Ireland, including a review of public procurement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the actions needed to tackle the
                community differential in unemployment are also found throughout
                the programme itself in areas such as infrastructure and
                planning, and equal access to education for all.</p>

                rather than demonstrating direct action. Can the First Minister
                and the Deputy First Minister assure the House that if this
                Programme for Government were fully implemented that coronary
                death rates and death rates from some cancers, which are now the
                highest in Europe, would be among the lowest in Europe?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. We are having questions on the
                Programme for Government, but not on every aspect of it.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appreciate the points made by the Member
                that some of the matters put down here are aspirational, as
                inevitably they will be in some respects. There are precise
                targets in a number of areas. This number will increase as we
                refine this process over the next few months by working out more
                precise actions and targets, something we will do through the
                public service agreements. When people look back on this,
                perhaps after a year or two, I hope they will see that the
                introduction of public service agreements was critical to enable
                us, as well as the public, to assess performance. Too often,
                particularly under direct rule, there was a tendency for the
                Administration simply to trundle on in the way it had done in
                the past and to think about how much extra money was going in.
                Extra money went in, but it was not always the case that more
                came out the other end, in terms of action taken and services
                delivered to the public.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I completely agree with the Member that we
                want to focus on the end product, that is the service that the
                public gets, because that is the most important thing. The
                Administration does not exist simply to serve itself and those
                who are employed by it. The Administration exists to deliver a
                service to the community, and that is the critical thing. A
                number of points were raised, and there are figures in here
                about the number of places. Whether that meets the need or not
                is another question that we will have to assess.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not going to respond to the question on
                local authorities because we are just starting a review on that.
                It would be quite inappropriate to say anything that would imply
                that we have a particular outcome of that review in mind. There
                are particular things in the area of health that we want to
                focus on. However, to give an assurance that we will, as a
                result of action taken, have the lowest rates for certain things
                would be quite inappropriate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have to realise, particularly in health,
                that some things are beyond our control. Northern Ireland has a
                remarkably high incidence of heart disease, a feature that it
                shares with the west of Scotland. What is the reason for that?
                Is it because of the present level of service in the Health
                Service? That is something that we can improve. Is it because of
                certain cultural factors, such as the incidence of poverty? We
                might be able to do something about that. But is it because of
                other cultural factors, such as diet? It is very difficult for
                us to change that. Is it also possible that the high level of
                heart disease here is because of genetic factors? There is very
                little we could do to affect that.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are three or four features in this
                statement from the First Minister that raise a fundamental
                question in my mind. First of all, as far as the 230 actions
                over the 30 sections are concerned, what is said about these
                actions is so vacuous as to be virtually devoid of content.
                There is absolutely no indication of how these objectives are
                going to be achieved. It is also impossible to link this
                statement with the budget allocations so we cannot see exactly
                how the budget will be used to finance this programme. Another
                point that follows on from all of that —</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is an opportunity for questions not for
                a series of statements, and the Member is about to make another
                one. I press him to ask a question.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Roche:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will ask my question. The document does not
                provide a real framework for subsequent negotiation, so why has
                it been produced at this time? Why have we been presented with a
                document devoid of any real content about the problems that
                confront people in Northern Ireland? Is it an attempt to create
                the appearance that we have a working Executive when we know
                that this whole process is in serious crisis?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will deal with the last question first. For
                the first time in almost 30 years, an Administration in the
                North of Ireland is planning its own Programme for Government
                and deciding its own budget. The Assembly is also deciding how
                it will deal with its representative capacity on behalf of the
                people of the North of Ireland. That is an important reason for
                producing this document now. The alternative is the type of
                situation that the Member seems to favour, where we would all
                trip up to see a visiting direct rule Minister and make
                representations to him in relation to the 230 actions in this
                programme, rather than devising it ourselves.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member described the 230 actions as
                vacuous. When he reads the programme further he will see that
                they are specific in a way that is almost dangerous. Indeed,
                their specific nature indicated some of the dangers to us, but
                we made a clear decision to be specific rather than vacuous
                about what we wanted to do.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member also says that there is no
                indication how these actions can be achieved. It is clear that
                they will be achieved in relation to the budget, after decisions
                are made in Committees and in the Assembly. When this ceases to
                be a draft document, it will be a Programme for Government honed
                on all the elements of this institution. Then it will be added
                to and strengthened, and given an even more specific role in
                relation to the points that the Member has to date failed to
                see.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ervine:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I give a guarded welcome to today’s
                statement. Nevertheless, it is an historic and significant day.
                It is the first time in my adult life that such a statement has
                been made by Northern Irish people behaving in a manner that is
                beneficial — I hope — to Northern Irish people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have heard about task forces and
                partnerships. We need agreement from those who have control of
                reserved matters. To achieve agreement on the Barnett formula,
                we must get people to hear our arguments. On the issue of drug
                and alcohol abuse, the partnership must be with those who
                control the security services. On the issue of children, the
                partnership must include the justice system, which is a reserved
                matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How confident are the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister that they can achieve those agreements and
                partnerships? Will they acknowledge that while there are those
                who will attempt to let on that they are the opposition in this
                Chamber, there is a real and genuine opposition, ineffective so
                far, which must be consulted? Will the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister give consideration to having proper
                consultation in the future with those who do not form the
                Government in this Chamber?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I take the Member’s last point. There is
                some force in his comments. In the circumstances, we did
                extremely well to get the document to this point. The same is
                true of the budgetary exercise — the two are related. In
                normal circumstances the programme would come before the budget,
                and although the budget was announced first, that does not mean
                that it was drawn up first. We were unable to produce the
                programme as a finished document in the time available, and the
                time pressures constrained the extent to which we could consult.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.30 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is intended that there will be a
                transparent process that will make it easier to consult. One of
                the culture changes that needs to occur because of the nature of
                this Assembly and the way in which it operates is that across
                the whole public service, officials will have to appreciate that
                everything needs to be much more open than in the past. The
                system whereby governmental decisions emerge from a process of
                private consultation will have to change.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the specific matters the Member mentioned,
                a great deal is already happening in terms of working together
                with the Government in London on reserved matters. There are a
                number of areas where the partnership between the devolved
                Administrations and the Government in London is already there.
                There is a joint working group between the devolved regions and
                the Government on the drugs issue, as there are on other issues,
                so we have a mechanism to deal with that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member mentioned two specific areas. With
                regard to drugs he mentioned policing and justice matters. Of
                course, that is an issue that could be devolved to this body,
                and I personally hope that it will be devolved sooner rather
                than later. It is essential from the point of view of our
                operation on a number of matters.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the matter of finance, one should always
                bear in mind that the so-called Barnett formula is not some
                arcane calculation. When devolution was proposed in the 1970s,
                it was necessary for Government to quickly think of some
                criterion. Joel Barnett, after whom the formula is named, was
                chief secretary to the Treasury at the time. He is quite
                prepared to tell people how he quickly drew up the formula on
                the back of an envelope in order to meet the crisis. Devolution
                did not actually occur in the 1970s, and so the Barnett formula
                has been there ever since.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Devolution has now occurred, and consequently
                we can confidently expect a serious reconsideration of the
                financing of the devolved Administrations. Nobody seriously
                expects that a 23- or 24-year-old formula can continue to be
                pressed into service in that situation. It is an extremely
                complex matter, but I expect that it will be addressed in coming
                years. That is the appropriate timescale. The Member can be
                assured that we will play a vigorous part in that consultation
                and re-examination.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We welcome the Programme for Government and
                congratulate the Executive on achieving this milestone. We are
                particularly pleased with the recognition given to issues such
                as disadvantage, poverty and division in the chapter entitled
                ‘Growing as a Community.’ I normally look for things that
                are missing from a programme, and I was going to mention
                integrated education, but I found it on page&nbsp;26, and I am
                delighted to see that. How much of the programme ultimately
                depends on private finance? Secondly, in terms of consultation
                what flexibility is there to take on board the Committees’
                recommendations, for example, on student finance?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I cannot say at this stage what funds may be
                available from private finance. That is something that has to be
                explored. It has possibilities, but, like everything else, it is
                not a panacea for all our problems. We will examine very
                carefully how we can utilise that facility in our Programme for
                Government, and if we find it to be advantageous, then
                collectively we should use it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, if we find that it is not, we may
                have to take a different position on the issue. One of the
                strongest points is how that and other aspects, in being dealt
                with by the Assembly and its Committees, will be bolstered up,
                added to and refined. I recommend to the Committees and the
                Assembly itself that the very pertinent question the
                Assemblylady asked be among those that they seriously consider.</p>

                opportunity to intervene, I appeal to Members to forgo their
                welcoming — or unwelcoming — perorations and stick to
                concise questions. Let us all hope that such questions will
                bring succinct answers, thus allowing as many Members as

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thank you, Mr Speaker. I shall take your
                advice. The First Minister will be aware that, of all the
                bread-and-butter issues, healthcare is probably that of greatest
                concern to the people whom we represent. Will he assure me that
                standards of health care will improve through this Programme for
                Government?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand Rev Robert Coulter’s point
                about the important issue of health. That is the reason for the
                significant increase in the health budget. The increase of 7·2%
                raises the budget to £2·3 billion. In other words, an extra
                £153 million is going into health next year, and that
                represents a massive increase in available resources. We wish to
                see both an improvement in health outcomes and what we are
                getting from our money, and we want to make sure that management
                throughout the service is providing us with the best return. As
                I said earlier, public service agreements will be a key matter
                in ensuring that focus.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The question of ill health and the generally
                poorer levels of health enjoyed in Northern Ireland is a complex
                matter which cannot be improved simply through increases in
                funding, although we have provided them. We must look at
                reductions in preventable disease and at the number of road
                traffic accidents. We must also deal with drugs and encourage
                people to adopt healthier lifestyles. That is the reason for the
                emphasis in the Programme for Government on a new public-health
                strategy which will attempt to deal with health in the round.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr A Maginness:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister and the Deputy First
                Minister have referred to the historic underinvestment in
                infrastructure in Northern Ireland. I should like to explore
                that area in relation to the future of the railway network here.
                Can the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister explain the
                implications of the programme for this issue? Given the
                budgetary restraints, how can we tackle the infrastructural
                deficit which we have unfortunately inherited?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Both parts of the question are totally
                relevant. The A D Little strategic review of railway safety
                clearly showed the scale of investment necessary just to ensure
                that the existing railway system continues to operate safely.
                That report highlighted the fundamental need for both short-term
                and long-term strategic decisions to be taken about the future
                of railways. The railways taskforce gave us a very valuable
                indication of how we might start to address this issue and
                provided a useful framework within which initial decisions can
                be taken on the future of Northern Ireland’s railways.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the first stage in the consideration of
                the existing network, additional funding of almost £20 million
                has been provided in the draft budget for 2001-2002. I believe
                that this signals the beginning of an investment programme which
                will bring the existing network up to modern safety and quality
                standards, and that includes the procurement of new rolling
                stock. As the taskforce made clear, the ten-year transport
                strategy provides the next key building block in developing a
                coherent view on this issue. We look forward to the Department’s
                bringing this to the Executive and the Assembly as soon as
                possible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By budgeting for an infrastructure renewal
                fund the Executive has also started to plan how it might finance
                such significant developments. Any proposal must fit into the
                overall transportation strategy and be backed by a clear
                business case. We need to think in new ways. We have to see if
                it is possible to draw private sector funding and management
                disciplines into this type of investment. That is one of the key
                questions that this Assembly and its Committees have got to
                address, and we should address it as soon as we can — honestly
                and openly — because it will be crucial to this and other
                matters. That is the way we should progress, so that we can get
                the best value for money out of the rail system.</p>

                areas, budget allocations for that have been cut. Also, there
                will be a sense of disappointment that while the draft Programme
                for Government deals with the issue of victims, only four words
                can be found in a statement of 21 pages on the needs of victims.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister talks about the amount of
                money going to North/South bodies. Will he accept that there
                will be deep disappointment, resentment and opposition among the
                people we represent at the &quot;North/Southery&quot; that is
                rampant throughout this Programme for Government that is
                designed to implement the all-Ireland aspects of the Belfast
                Agreement? Will he accept that it is wrong to prioritise the
                implementation of that all-Ireland dimension instead of dealing
                with important areas such as children and infrastructure
                renewal? He should remember that every £1 million spent on
                all-Ireland bodies could go towards building 25 new homes for
                the homeless, adapting 1,000 homes for the disabled and
                installing central heating in 300 homes. Does he accept that
                many people believe that money would be better spent on those
                items than on all-Ireland institutions?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am surprised that the Member has returned
                to the issue of North/South co-operation, and I remind him of
                the point I made to his Colleague. If he had looked carefully at
                the budget, which he has had the opportunity to for over a week
                — not the Programme for Government, which he has had for a few
                brief hours only — he would have seen that the total spend on
                that subject next year is £11 million out of nearly £6
                billion. That puts it in perspective.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If he had then looked at the specific items
                that the £11 million was to be spent on, he would have seen
                that they are good things. I talked to his Colleague about an
                all-Ireland energy market. That could equally be described as an
                all-British Isles energy market, because one of its key elements
                is to make sure that energy resources, particularly gas, become
                available throughout the island of Ireland to benefit us as well
                as everybody else.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I could also cite the example of the
                expenditure on waterways. One of the objectives — although it
                will take some time to come through — is to restore some
                canals, starting with the Ulster canal and going on to others.
                That will be of considerable significance to tourism, which is
                very important for the Northern Ireland economy. If one looked
                at that, one would appreciate how valuable it is. I am prepared
                to do a commercial for waterway holidays, having enjoyed them
                twice in the last three years. However, that is a significant
                economic sector.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As regards the question of victims, when the
                Member has had the opportunity to peruse the document he will
                see that there are five different actions in it dealing with the
                needs of victims. They are aspirational, in some respects, for
                example, putting in place a cross-departmental strategy for
                ensuring that the needs of victims are met. Such a strategy is
                very necessary, and there will be financial aspects to consider
                as well. The Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First
                Minister is establishing a victims unit to deal with issues of
                this nature. We are dealing with these problems in a practical
                way, rather than trying to make a totally misconceived political
                point, as the Member did.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.45 am</p>
                </i><b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Gildernew:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat. Do the First Minister
                and the Deputy First Minister agree that expanding North/South
                co-operation can aid economic development and provide
                significant benefits in terms of savings and service delivery?
                Will they make a statement on the action, measures, targets and
                commitments in the Programme for Government to build on the
                contribution that North/South co-operation can make to our
                economic and social well-being? Furthermore, do they agree that
                the Executive could ask the Irish Government to provide
                additional funding for some elements of the Programme for
                Government?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The last part of the question appeals to me
                because of its political content and its mischievousness. I know
                that the Member will not expect me to give a definitive reply.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The establishment of the new institutions has
                meant that expenditure decisions are now taken in a wider
                context. That will produce efficiencies of scale and more
                effective delivery of services in both parts of Ireland.
                Furthermore, we expect a high level of added value from this
                expenditure. I will give some examples. The new trade and
                business development body is urgently tackling the low levels of
                cross-border trade in Ireland, and I expect, as does that body,
                a fairly immediate increase in trade levels. The special EU
                programmes body (SEUPB) is focusing attention on the benefits of
                EU programmes North and South. Anybody who is aware of the
                problems in the border areas will immediately recognise how
                effective those can be if we get them right.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The new all-Ireland tourism company, which is
                soon to be established, will market the whole island for foreign
                tourism to an unprecedented level. That should not be
                underestimated. The potential for tourism in Northern Ireland is
                enormous. The relationship with the South of Ireland through
                that tourism company will greatly benefit Northern Ireland. As
                an Assembly we should focus on increasing and developing
                tourism, as it is an area of great potential.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Co-operation in important areas of
                administration including education, health, agriculture and the
                environment will produce major benefits for everyone on the
                island. I will end by returning to the Member’s last point. It
                is something I find piquant, and I will certainly refer it to
                the relevant authorities.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Leslie:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While responsibility for setting the rates of
                fuel taxation rests with Westminster, the First and the Deputy
                First Ministers will appreciate that people in Northern Ireland
                wonder if the Administration can do anything to ameliorate this
                problem. Do they have any means at their disposal to address
                that matter?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately this is a complex issue. As the
                Member acknowledged, fuel taxation is a matter for Westminster,
                and, consequently, it is not directly within our gift. However,
                we have done what we can. Part of the Programme for Government
                is about developing a strategy to target lobbying for the
                benefit of the people. We have discussed fuel taxation with the
                Treasury and with Downing Street, and we have also raised the
                issue at the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference (BIIC).
                If there had been another BIIC then we would have raised the
                issue again, and we look forward to having the opportunity to do
                so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also have access to Brussels, where the
                issue can be raised in the European context, with regard to the
                effects of fuel taxation differentials. We have examined the
                problems in the Dutch border areas, where a degree of assistance
                was given to some sectors. Unfortunately, I am advised that we
                would have difficulty with the state aid rules in having the
                same arrangement here. However, it is an issue that we will
                continue to pursue.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a result of the troubles over the last 30
                years the economy has been faced with difficulties in that
                potential investors have a particular perception of what things
                are like here. How does the Deputy First Minister intend to use
                the Programme for Government to change that international
                perception and make Northern Ireland a more competitive location
                for investment? More specifically, how does he intend to take
                advantage of the North/South dimension to assist in terms of
                investment?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The obvious and immediate answer is that the
                perception of the North of Ireland is what we make it. In
                respect of business and trade, people’s first reaction to what
                Northern Ireland is all about comes from the daily news, so if
                there is more stability and things become more peaceful here,
                there will be a greater perception that it is a place to do
                business in. We should not lose sight of that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the Programme for Government we recognise
                that a competitive, knowledge-based economy requires the right
                education, skills and infrastructure policies. I believe that
                they are contained in the Programme for Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As was mentioned in the statement, 27
                specific actions have been planned in the priority area of
                education and skills. Business is increasingly being conducted
                electronically, and in order to compete effectively in the
                global market, we need a cutting-edge telecommunications
                infrastructure. The Executive will work hard to encourage this.
                We will also ensure that access to the opportunities provided by
                e-business is available to all sections of society and to all
                areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We will undertake a programme of structural
                maintenance for roads based on good practice treatments. In
                time, this will reduce the significant backlog in roads
                maintenance that has built up over recent months. The road
                infrastructure is crucially important to those wishing to invest
                in the North of Ireland with the sort of businesses that we hope
                for.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As for the second part of the question, we
                must strengthen gas and electricity interconnection — north,
                south, east and west. We need to progressively open these
                markets. That will help improve business competitiveness and
                give consumers greater choice at affordable prices. I will
                mention energy specifically, because the Member asked about the
                North/South infrastructure. We plan to take the following
                actions: by 31 December 2001, we will prepare an energy market
                strategy for Northern Ireland in an all-Ireland, all-island and
                European context; by April 2001, while working with our Southern
                counterparts, we will secure firm private-sector proposals for
                North/South and North/West gas pipelines; and also by April
                2001, we will aim for agreement between Northern Ireland
                Electricity and the Electricity Supply Board on action to
                address the conclusions of a joint feasibility study into
                further interconnection between their networks.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr S Wilson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister told the House about his
                holiday arrangements. He talked about the fact that he had gone
                sailing, but perhaps the words &quot;selling&quot; and
                &quot;down the river&quot; spring more to mind as we listen to
                him.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to press the First Minister on some
                points that my Colleagues made. I noted the glowing references
                that he made about North/South bodies — perhaps I got it wrong
                last week when I heard him threatening to withdraw from them.
                Assuming that his figure of £11 million is correct — and we
                will examine last week’s budget statement to see if he needs
                to apologise to the House again — will the First Minister tell
                us how many extra care packages we could have had over and above
                the 230 announced, had we not gone in for &quot;North/Southery&quot;?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How many training places for skills, which
                are in short supply, over and above the 500 announced could we
                have had? How quickly could pre-school places have been made
                available, had we not gone in for &quot;North /Southery&quot;?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, will the First Minister tell us why
                we are concentrating on the review of under-representation in
                the senior ranks of the Civil Service? Is he not of the vast
                under-representation of Protestants in the lower ranks in some
                Departments? Why has that been ignored in this Programme for
                Government?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thirdly, a great deal of money has been
                announced for politically correct causes — the promotion of
                the Irish language, the equality industry, cultural diversity,
                and so on. Will the First Minister tell us how much money the
                Programme for Government is devoting to the promotion of the
                politically correct lobby in Northern Ireland?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am going to resist the temptation that the
                Member has put in front of me of trying to work out a definition
                of what is and what is not politically correct. For that reason
                I am not in a position to say how much has gone into the
                politically correct lobby. While I am sure that we may agree on
                many things, we may not agree on the definition of what is and
                what is not politically correct.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the review of senior Civil
                Service appointments, of course we want to see that the Civil
                Service broadly represents society. That is equally as important
                at senior level as it is at junior level. I am not in a position
                to comment on the question that the Member raised regarding
                junior ranks in the Civil Service, but I will look into it and
                correspond with him on the matter. One of the main objectives of
                the review — and I want to emphasise this — is to ensure
                that we get the best people at the high levels. The primary
                overall objective is to get the best people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The function of the Northern Ireland Civil
                Service is changing, and it is changing in one very important
                respect that relates directly to this exercise. Through the
                direct rule years the Administration here largely replicated
                policies evolved across the water. Consequently there was not a
                great need in the Northern Ireland Civil Service for a capacity
                to think about and evolve policy. It was simply a matter of
                Ministers flying in and saying &quot;Do this; do the same as we
                are doing in England.&quot; and of our making adjustments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now, of course, we will follow — and
                necessarily follow because of funding arrangements — the broad
                shape of public policy evolution as it takes place throughout
                the United Kingdom as a whole. However, there is now much
                greater scope for policy development and evolution here, and the
                capacity to evolve policy becomes much more important in terms
                of the senior appointments in the Civil Service. We need to look
                again at the criteria regarding appointments to ensure that
                people with that capacity are coming through. That is a very
                important feature of the exercise.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once again, I am sorry to say, there has been
                a reference to North/South expenditure, and so on, and I can
                appreciate the little joke that the Member tried to engage in.
                If I may, I will use the phrases that are used in another place.
                It says here that the Northern Ireland contribution amounts to
                £11·1 million, and I can break that down with regard to the
                implementation bodies. Waterways Ireland costs are £2·26
                million; the language body’s costs are £3·5 million; costs
                in respect of the food safety promotion board are £1·46
                million; those in respect of the trade and business development
                body are £2·88 million; £0·6 million is attributable to the
                costs of special EU programmes body, and in respect of Loughs
                and Lights they are £0·44 million.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Again I make the point that that must be put
                in context and weighed against the expenditure elsewhere. With
                regard to what is happening specifically on these matters, we
                are going to get value for money. I have no doubt about that —
                and that is important. Of course the £11 million could be spent
                elsewhere, and I hope that we would get the same value for money
                if it were.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Cheann Comhairle, I welcome the publication
                of the draft Programme for Government. It is an important
                milestone in the peace process, and I congratulate the Executive
                on its collective effort in producing it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Do the Ministers agree that concerted action
                is needed to eliminate the unequal distribution of resources and
                investment west of the Bann? Will they make a statement on the
                specific actions, measures and commitments in the Programme for
                Government to direct investment and investors to specific areas,
                for example, in my constituency of West Tyrone?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I note the latter part of the Member’s
                question, but I am sure that in the interest of the greater good
                he will allow me to concentrate on the wider aspects.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive, through the Programme for
                Government, is committed to tackling poverty and economic and
                social disadvantage wherever it arises. It is clear that there
                are higher levels of poverty and economic disadvantage west of
                the Bann. Tackling that is a complex issue requiring action on a
                range of policies. Under the new TSN policy, Departments are
                committed to directing resources and efforts to areas of
                greatest socio-economic disadvantage defined by objective
                criteria of need. That involves, for example, differential
                grants for industrial development in disadvantaged areas and
                encouragement to investors. In the Programme for Government,
                Departments commit themselves to meeting all those targets and
                to all their actions in the TSN action plans.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Programme for Government also emphasises
                that rural development will benefit the area west of the Bann,
                with its high rural population. The issue of rural development
                should be carefully looked at in the Assembly and in Committees
                to ensure that that strategy comes to the fruition that I
                believe we all want to see. It proposes balanced regional
                development and sets out measures to make Northern Ireland more
                attractive to visitors. That will benefit rural areas. We are
                not using our remarkable advantages, especially in rural areas,
                to develop what could be a burgeoning interest in tourism in
                Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Programme for Government commits us to
                tackling disadvantage in the education and training system,
                particularly in disadvantaged areas, and that includes 12,000
                business development training places for farmers. Ultimately the
                agriculture industry, and all things concerned with it, is going
                to be crucial to the success of the Programme for Government in
                areas such as the Member has specified.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given what has just been said about the
                development of the economy, do the First Minister and the Deputy
                First Minister agree that the additional 200 undergraduate
                places projected over four years is a little low? Also, there
                appears to be no mention of postgraduate places. Do they agree
                that the importance to Northern Ireland’s economy of keeping
                people on higher degrees must not be underestimated? Similarly,
                do they also consider that the role of an information technology
                commission to identify the economic opportunities that may arise
                should be included in the Programme for Government?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I take the Member’s points on postgraduate
                places and information technology. They are extremely important
                factors in the economy of Northern Ireland, and there has been a
                significant expansion in the number of information technology
                postgraduate places in Northern Ireland. I am not in a position
                to comment on future trends, but no doubt we will have the
                opportunity to explore the matter further.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Northern Ireland economy is doing very
                well, particularly in the software sector, where there have been
                significant year-on-year increases in the number of persons
                employed. A few weeks ago we had the pleasure of opening a plant
                for Service and Systems Solutions Ltd (Sx3). This company, which
                was once connected to Northern Ireland Electricity, has trebled
                its employment in just a few years. That is an indication of
                what can be done.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Also, unemployment is now at its lowest since
                1984, which is a remarkable achievement. To get that down
                further, we will have to concentrate as much on basic skills as
                on skills at the top, particularly if we are to achieve the
                levels of social inclusion that we want. The best way to deal
                with the problems caused by social exclusion and to make people
                feel included is by getting them jobs. The people we have to get
                into employment to enable them to play a full part in society
                and to contribute to it are those who have problems with basic
                skills — even the ability to count, to read and to write,
                which are absolutely critical in this respect. What has been
                done in terms of IT and postgraduates has contributed to the
                economy and will continue to do so, but we have to balance our
                priorities.</p>

                proposed to be spent on administration in their own remit so
                that the benefit to the citizens in terms of delivery of

                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Resource accounting and budgeting is a new
                system of planning, controlling and reporting on public
                expenditure. The Bill marks a major milestone on the way to the
                full implementation of resource accounting and budgeting in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland Departments and demonstrates a commitment
                to introducing best practice accounting methods to the public
                sector. The Bill largely follows similar legislation recently
                passed at Westminster — the Government Resources and Accounts
                Act 2000 — and in the other devolved Administrations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill will deliver two major reforms.
                First, it introduces resource accounting and budgeting to
                government accounts and modernises the operation of other
                aspects of the Exchequer and Audit Act (Northern
                Ireland)&nbsp;1921. That will improve the way in which the
                Assembly votes and scrutinises public spending with proper
                measurement of the full economic costs of government activities,
                better treatment of capital spending and systematic reporting of
                allocation of resources to objectives.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Madam Deputy Speaker [Ms Morrice] in the
                Chair)</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, the Bill provides enabling
                legislation for the preparation and audit of consolidated
                accounts for the whole of the Northern&nbsp;Ireland public
                sector. That information will, in turn, be included in the
                United Kingdom-wide government accounts to be produced by the
                Treasury.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The resource accounting and budgeting
                initiative was launched in 1993 during direct rule. Since then,
                Northern Ireland Departments have been actively working towards
                the introduction of resource accounting and budgeting. For
                Members unfamiliar with the technicalities of the move to
                resource accounting and budgeting, resource accounting applies
                accruals accounting techniques to central Government by focusing
                on resources consumed rather than cash spent. Therefore one main
                change from the current system is in the treatment of fixed
                assets.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Resource accounting will reflect the cost of
                consuming fixed assets, and the cost of holding them, through a
                charge for depreciation and the cost of capital, rather than
                just the cost of acquisition as under the present cash-based
                system of accounting. By highlighting the real costs that arise
                through neglect of capital assets, this system will bring home
                to us all, and to Departments, the true effects of financial
                decisions on capital assets.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Resource accounting is based on generally
                accepted accounting practice in the United Kingdom. It reflects
                the accounting and disclosure requirements of accounting
                standards issued by the Accounting Standards Board, and the
                Companies (Northern Ireland) Order 1986, to the extent that this
                is appropriate to central Government. Resource accounting will
                form the basis of resource budgeting, so that we can plan and
                control central Government expenditure on an accruals basis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I said in my budget statement last week,
                the public expenditure plans from 2001-02 onwards are on the new
                basis. Subject to Assembly approval, supply will be voted on an
                accruals basis under resource accounting and budgeting. Resource
                accounts will replace appropriation accounts, but will
                essentially fulfil the same function.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Resource accounting and budgeting applies the
                best financial reporting practices of the private sector to
                central Government. For the first time, we will produce the
                equivalent of the main financial statements in commercial
                accounting. That includes a balance sheet, an operating costs
                statement, a statement of recognised gains and losses and a cash
                flow statement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, resource accounting and budgeting
                goes even further. Under the new system, there will also be a
                summary of resource out-turns, reflecting Assembly control, and,
                critically, a statement of resources by departmental aims and
                objectives under Public Service Agreements. That will enable us
                to focus on outcomes, not inputs, and on the products of our
                spending, not just the size of our investment. In turn, we can
                ensure that future public spending is planned and controlled
                prudently. I emphasised last week that the Executive see this as
                a very important opportunity to improve the way we plan and
                manage spending.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Resource accounting makes two important
                improvements to the outdated and outmoded present system of
                cash-based accounting. First, it will ensure that the full
                economic cost of a Department’s activities is measured
                properly by including costs, such as capital consumption, which
                are not reflected in cash-based accounts. It will also match the
                costs to the right time period, providing the Assembly with a
                better basis for allocating resources. It is more realistic to
                bring costs or income to account when commitments are made,
                rather than when cash changes hands. Secondly, it will bring
                about improvements in the treatment of capital spending, so that
                instead of simply identifying the cost in full in the year of
                acquisition, the cost of capital will be spread over its useful
                life, which is obviously sensible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the longer term, the Treasury’s aim is
                for resource accounting and budgeting to lead to Whole of
                Government Accounts (WGA), which is the natural next step. The
                Bill would make it possible to produce WGA for the Northern
                Ireland public sector, which can, in turn, be incorporated into
                WGA for the UK. These accounts will improve the information
                available to the Assembly and provide greater transparency for
                taxpayers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, to produce full audited WGA, we will
                need greater conformity in accounting policies, systems and
                procedures. That is a major challenge. A staged approach is
                therefore being adopted wherein we will first concentrate on
                delivering audited accounts covering Government Departments,
                agencies and non-departmental bodies. A final decision to extend
                coverage to the whole of the public sector will be taken in due
                course, when the outcomes of various developments in financial
                reporting and other developmental work are clear.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Comptroller and Auditor General and his
                office will play a pivotal role in the implementation of
                resource accounting and budgeting. I fully support the work of
                the Comptroller and Auditor General and recognise the importance
                of his independence and the need for him to have wide-ranging
                powers to report to the Assembly. This is reflected in the
                detail of the Bill.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the current draft of the Bill
                excludes one important clause that was included in the
                Government Resources and Accounts Act 2000 after a protracted
                debate. The clause requires the Treasury to consult an advisory
                board before issuing accounting guidance in order to demonstrate
                that any departures from generally accepted accounting practise
                are justified by the public sector context. This role is
                fulfilled by the Financial Reporting Advisory Board (FRAB)
                established by the Chancellor. FRAB is required to report
                annually to Parliament on its activities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are several ways in which we could deal
                with this issue in the Northern Ireland context. I intend to
                discuss this in detail with the Public Accounts Committee and
                the Finance and Personnel Committee with a view to tabling a
                suitable amendment as the Bill progresses.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I indicated earlier, the spending review
                has already been conducted on a resource accounting basis, and
                the intention is that the estimates process should be moved to a
                resource accounting basis for the financial year 2001 - 2002.
                This means that the first resource accounts to be audited and
                laid before the Assembly will be in respect of the financial
                year 2001 - 2002.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, Departments are already
                proceeding with the implementation of resource accounting
                budgeting systems and procedures. This has not been a
                trouble-free process, not least because of dual running and the
                other significant competing pressures faced by Departments. In
                the circumstances I wish to pay tribute to Departments which
                have done a tremendous job in developing resource accounts
                alongside cash accounts, and to the Northern Ireland Audit
                office for its support during the process.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not surprising that there has been some
                slippage, but we believe enough progress has been made to
                suggest that we remain on course to deliver on time. Accordingly
                I commend the Bill to the Assembly, and I will try to answer
                points raised by Members when I speak at the end of the debate.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Finance and Personnel
                Committee (Mr Molloy): </b>Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann
                Comhairle. As the Minister indicated, the Committee will review
                the Bill and, it is to be hoped, we will be able to advise the
                Assembly of future changes or recommendations. I will keep my
                comments to a minimum at this stage, but I would like to ask the
                Minister if it is valid to equate the accounting systems used in
                the private sector with those in the public service? The public
                service is not in the business of chasing profit margins and
                satisfying investors. Can we still maintain the services which
                are required as part of the public sector?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will this Bill reduce the number of spending
                reviews we have seen over the last couple of years? Will it
                eventually wipe them out? Spending should be clearly accounted
                for within the resource accounting system. Can the Assembly
                assume that the Bill will introduce a genuinely simpler, more
                transparent and streamlined system of accounts for the future?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Public Accounts
                Committee (Mr B Bell):</b> I welcome the proposals contained in
                the Government Resources and Accounts Bill and recognise the
                value of resource accounting in leading to improvements in the
                clarity and quality of financial information available to
                Members of the Assembly for scrutiny purposes. It is important
                that Northern Ireland Departments have financial accounts that
                conform to best practice in the rest of the United Kingdom. The
                Bill will help to ensure that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am aware that aspects of the comparable
                legislation in GB have been very contentious and that Lord
                Sharman is currently reviewing the arrangements for public
                sector audit. I expect that the Department of Finance and
                Personnel will consider the implications of the Sharman review
                for Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the areas being addressed is the right
                of the Comptroller and Auditor General to inspect the books of
                bodies that spend public money and report to the Assembly. Those
                rights are extensive, and the Comptroller and Auditor General
                audits all Departments and most public bodies. However, as the
                public sector develops, those inspection rights need to be kept
                up to date, and Assembly Members will be determined to see that
                access rights for the Comptroller and Auditor General are as
                adequate as those at Westminster.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am glad that the Minister has said that he
                and his officials will meet the Public Accounts Committee
                shortly to discuss these matters further. Members’ ability to
                hold the Executive to account depends on the information
                provided by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his reports.
                Therefore, his access rights are our access rights. The Assembly’s
                auditors ought to follow public money wherever it is spent in
                Northern Ireland.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McClelland:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I listened intently this morning to the
                exciting initiatives, new developments and breaks with the past
                presented to us in the Programme for Government. It is
                unfortunate that the same media attention is not given to this
                new initiative; perhaps that is because accounting procedures
                are not considered to be quite as exciting as other issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the initiative for a range of
                reasons. It will bring best practice in the private sector into
                the public sector. That is important, because good cost benefit
                analysis is important in both the public and private sectors.
                The initiative will enable the Assembly to make better-informed
                judgements and will make the Executive more accountable to the
                Assembly. We will have greater control over stock, debts and
                credits in the public sector. One of its most important features
                is that it will promote greater transparency in Government.
                Finally, I would like the Minister to assure us that the
                introduction of the measures in the Bill will not involve more
                expenditure on the Assembly.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Chairperson of the Finance and
                Personnel Committee (Mr Leslie): </b>I give the Bill a qualified
                welcome. In time, it may emerge that several proposals may not
                work as smoothly and as sweetly as expected. We must be aware
                that, to some extent, the blind are leading the blind. This is a
                new departure in Treasury accounting and must be followed in the
                devolved institutions, although I would not be surprised if
                certain aspects required some revision at a later stage. That is
                not in any way a criticism of what is proposed here, but it may
                be a realistic view.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I caution the Minister against making what is
                a strong statement — that this is a move towards best
                practice; it is a move towards a practice that is common in the
                private sector and is best suited to the private sector. Whether
                that is necessarily the best practice for the Government sector
                may emerge and be subject to scrutiny over time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What concerns me in relation to Treasury
                accounting is the propensity of the current Government to double
                and treble account at every opportunity — to the extent that
                they seem to have forgotten where they started. I commend our
                Minister for resisting that practice, and I trust that he will
                continue to do so. However, I suspect that moving to
                resource-based accounting may improve the Government’s ability
                to double and treble account and make it more difficult for
                those scrutinising their measures to find out.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Turning to the detail of the Bill, I note the
                intention to value Government assets. It will be extremely
                useful to know the value of the Government estate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can the Minister tell us what valuation
                method is proposed? If an outside valuer is to be used in any
                instances, what costs are likely to be incurred? With what
                frequency will those assets be revalued, and what costs are
                likely to be incurred on those occasions? Part of the process of
                placing a value on those assets is that they will then be
                depreciated. What depreciation policies does the Minister intend
                to follow? Clearly, the depreciation policy for a building will
                be different from that for a piece of modern technology such as
                a computer. The private sector swings about on which
                depreciation model to use. Therefore, having established what we
                are going to do, we will need to keep the matter under review.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have some comments about moving to an
                accrual basis. The essence of accruals is that the accounts
                reflect the intention to spend money in a time frame,
                irrespective of whether the cash has changed hands. It is not as
                straightforward to apply this method to capital assets. The
                essence of a capital asset tends to be that the money has been
                spent. One accrues the liability over time, because the use of
                the asset is spread over a number of years, and so its value
                only arises over time. However, in cash terms, the likelihood is
                that the money has been spent.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a potential contradiction between
                the intentions under the cash system and how capital expenditure
                is going to be treated. At Treasury level, that is, in effect,
                dealt with by the Government borrowing requirement through the
                gilt market. By borrowing money, say for 10 years, the cost of
                acquiring that asset is spread over that period until the money
                is repaid. Government borrowing is not hypothecated in any way
                — certainly not at this stage — so there is no direct link
                between the issue of a particular gilt and the expenditure of
                particular money, but there is, in essence, an indirect link. I
                wonder whether it will be possible to apply these measures to
                capital assets without putting in some mechanism to identify the
                borrowing relating to the acquisition of the capital asset. For
                example, were we to engage in a five- year programme to upgrade
                the railway system, we might take a 15-year view on the benefit.
                However, the money for the upgrading would have to be found over
                five years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the other hand, the ability to mobilise
                and use private finance through private finance initiatives
                would clearly be enhanced. That is one of the Bill’s
                intentions, and that should be welcomed, but the Minister must
                focus very carefully on exactly how the accounting in these
                areas is going to be done.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important that the parallel running of
                the cash system and the resource-based accounting system should
                go on for some time, because the transition may prove to be
                quite difficult. It will be difficult under the resource- based
                accounting system — certainly in the early years — to make
                proper comparisons with previous years unless the old system is
                run in parallel.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Fee:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum
                in respect of the Bill I see that it is expected that the
                resource accounting and budgeting will cover only the central
                Government sector in the immediate future. However, the Bill
                permits the Department to designate other bodies such as health
                boards, trusts and local councils, et cetera. Has the Minister
                given any thought to the timescale for the application of this
                accounting system across all public administration?</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.30 pm</p>
                </i><b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Members for their contributions and
                questions. Several points have been raised, and I wish to deal
                with as many of those as I can in the short time available.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Finance and Personnel
                Committee, Mr Francie Molloy, raised several questions. I
                welcome the fact that the Committee will be giving full
                consideration to this Bill. It is more than a technical
                financial management instrument. It has key policy implications
                in that it will change how policy priorities, commitments and
                ambitions are articulated within spending plans and the
                management of public expenditure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On Mr Molloy’s question as to whether it is
                appropriate to incorporate accounting procedures from the
                private sector into the public sector, I would make the point
                which was later made by Mr McClelland. We are trying to
                incorporate best practice, and that should be the business of
                the public sector.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With reference to the UK generally accepted
                accounting practice (GAAP), that is a ready-made set of rules.
                We are not talking about following them blindly, as some people
                are worried about. The Northern Ireland resource account manual
                interprets GAAP as being appropriate to reflect the fact that
                resource accounting will form part of the planning and control
                system for central Government and also to reflect the
                non-commercial nature of Government activities. We are talking
                about best practice relating to accounting methods but not about
                ignoring the fundamental nature of Government business and
                public-service operations. We will have due regard for the
                realities and requirements of both.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Concerns were raised about whether this could
                lead to fewer spending reviews. The main issue here is not so
                much whether there will be more or fewer spending reviews, but
                there will be a different way of conducting them. That is the
                whole point of moving from the focus’s being on inputs to
                outcomes — what it is we are trying to buy as an Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are talking about a system whereby the
                Assembly will decide to buy particular service outcomes and
                results from various Government Departments and public bodies,
                funded by public expenditure, so that will change and
                fundamentally improve the nature of spending reviews in the
                future and should allow for improved scrutiny by the Assembly
                and its Committees.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Billy Bell spoke as Chairperson of the
                Public Accounts Committee, and I appreciate the fact that he was
                able to give a broad welcome to resource accounts and budgeting
                and that he recognises the importance of such accounts
                conforming to best practice elsewhere, which we have to take
                into account. The whole move to resource accounting and
                budgeting is not confined simply to the UK. We should follow it,
                not just because it is being followed elsewhere in the UK, but
                because it is becoming the norm in a variety of jurisdictions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Mr Bell said, the access rights of the
                Comptroller and Auditor General are being reviewed by the
                Sharman committee, and we will take full cognisance of anything
                that develops. We are keeping a watching brief on that, and we
                will bring forward appropriate measures for Northern Ireland in
                due course.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Donovan McClelland gave a broad welcome to
                the thrust of the Bill. I can assure him that the use of
                resource accounting and budgeting should not, of itself, create
                any extra costs in the planning and management of public
                expenditure. Obviously, insofar as the move to resource
                accounting and budgeting may have involved additional
                expenditure, then that has already been incurred by Departments
                in setting up the necessary accounting systems. I can reassure
                him that there will be no extra costs built into the system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Member asked whether this is about best
                practice, and I am glad to answer in the affirmative. It really
                is about best practice. It is not about trying to pretend that
                the public sector and public services are not the public sector
                and are not public services; it is to make it clear that we know
                we are in the business of responsible financial management. If
                we are to be properly accountable and transparent, then we need
                to perform to those standards.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">James Leslie raised several points. I take
                his point that more detail will have to be considered as we take
                this Bill forward. I want to speak to both the Finance and
                Personnel Committee and the Public Accounts Committee about
                various aspects of the legislation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As for the treatment and valuation of
                property assets, major property assets will be valued by the
                Valuation and Lands Office on a cyclical basis, probably every
                five years. That will help to spread the cost of valuation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In regard to the public sector borrowing
                requirement and the Treasury, the cash system that we currently
                have does not bring home to public sector managers the
                opportunity cost of holding assets. It will make a difference if
                they have to account for a capital charge or for depreciation.
                The logic and motive should be clear. I accept that there are
                further issues that we need to explore on how we handle, manage
                and portray depreciation. That is one of the further details of
                the Bill that the Assembly and Committees can work through.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To date, the systems have run in parallel.
                That creates some difficulties and, going back to Donovan
                McClelland’s point, incurs some cost. However, I am prepared
                to look at how long we should continue parallel running if
                people believe that it will help to improve the judgements made
                in relation to the value of resource accounting and budgeting.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We cannot continue parallel running
                indefinitely. We want to move in a committed and unambiguous way
                towards resource accounting and budgeting. The Assembly would
                find it easier to concentrate on one method, as would
                Departments, and, I believe, the Committees.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On Mr Fee’s point, the whole of government
                accounts clauses address the extension of resource accounting
                and budgeting outside central Government. That will take a
                number of years to implement. At this stage, we are focussing on
                central Government Departments and the bodies most directly
                related to them. In due course, we will make proposals to extend

                the basis of our experience and knowledge. It would be
                gratuitous to set a timetable at this stage. On that basis, I

                and the Deputy First Minister to take appropriate and immediate
                steps to appoint a representative of the Grand Orange Lodge of
                Ireland to the Civic Forum.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will recall that the First Minister
                and the Deputy First Minister announced the membership of the
                Civic Forum to the Assembly on 25 September. At that time many
                of us raised a number of general points of contention about the
                make-up of the Civic Forum. People had problems with the fact
                that there are 10 representatives, for instance, from the
                business and agriculture/fisheries sector. Compared to the
                representation from the voluntary and community sector, which
                numbers 18, there seems to be an imbalance. Victims have only
                two representatives on the Civic Forum. In addition we have the
                incongruous position whereby the First Minister and the Deputy
                First Minister represent — I am indebted to the Alliance Party’s
                Mr Ford for this figure in a previous debate — only 0·00012%
                of the population, yet they have nominated 10% of the members of
                the Civic Forum. I also note that Mr&nbsp;Mallon appointed
                someone who lives and works outside Northern Ireland. It seems a
                strange set of criteria to use in appointing someone to the
                Civic Forum in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We raised many issues relating to the general
                make-up of the Civic Forum when the matter first came before the
                Assembly on 16 February 1999. On 25 September the First Minister
                time and again referred to the fact that it was a bit late for
                Members to raise issues because the Assembly had previously
                agreed on a way to nominate members to the Forum. He failed to
                point out that many Members had spoken out and voted against
                that system. On 16 February, 28 Members went into the Lobbies
                against the proposed make-up of the Civic Forum. There is no
                point in representatives of the First Minister coming here
                today, as they did on 25 September, and telling us that
                everything is agreed. It was agreed on a vote, but it was not
                agreed by many who sit on these Benches, so we are quite
                entitled to raise these matters.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also noted when I went through the record
                of the debate of 16 February that Mr Ford of the Alliance Party
                had an interesting suggestion, which was that members of the
                Civic Forum be rotated. That that is an interesting observation
                in the light of some of the criticisms he has since made about
                the principle of rotation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After the Assembly’s approval in February
                1999 of the way in which the Civic Forum was to be made up, we
                all expected that there would be a realistic attempt to achieve
                balance, fairness and inclusivity and a general willingness to
                see that the principles of equality were implemented. On 25
                September Mr Mallon told the House that the body should
                incorporate the total width of views in Northern Ireland. Anyone
                who looks down the list of members can see that we have
                ex-terrorists involved, we have a failed politician involved and
                we have a whole litany of &quot;Yes&quot; people involved. With
                a few honourable exceptions, there is little room for people who
                have a different view on the Belfast Agreement or for people who
                represent the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland at a high level.
                That is a grave omission, which once again cuts across pledges
                and promises that were made not only in the House but outside it
                as well.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whatever members of the various parties in
                the House may think of the Orange Order — and as a member of
                that Order I have to declare an interest — they have to accept
                that it is one of the largest Protestant organisations in
                Northern Ireland. It has many thousands of members. It has a
                vital role to play in the cultural identity of the Protestant
                and Unionist people of Northern Ireland. It is a grave omission
                indeed that the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister
                have not seen fit to recognise the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland
                in a proper and fitting way by having a member from it on the
                Civic Forum.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the debate on 21 September Mr Mallon
                stated that he wants the Civic Forum to be a body that is
                uncomfortable for the Assembly. It certainly will not cause much
                discomfort to Mr Mallon and his party, or to the pro-agreement
                parties, because there are not many voices in it that will be
                raised in disagreement with their political point of view.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have no doubt that when the Ministers come
                to reply to this debate, they will suggest that our raising this
                issue and our expressing an interest in the Forum membership
                implies support for the idea of the Civic Forum. Nothing could
                be further from the truth. The Civic Forum has been appointed,
                and we have a right to express a view on its membership.
                However, nothing we say should be taken as an endorsement of the
                idea of the Civic Forum.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the Ulster Unionist Party’s leading
                research aides, who perhaps wrote Mr Nesbitt’s speech today,
                has expressed concerns about the Civic Forum in the local press.
                We all know why it was set up and who was behind its setting up.
                One political party has good reason to support its creation
                because it is the only place in which it can get any sort of
                representation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On 25 September the First Minister said that
                because Members had raised the omission of Grand Orange Lodge
                representatives, or even one representative, this somehow was to
                misunderstand the nature of the process. No doubt this tired old
                excuse will be trotted out today by the Ministers. The reality
                is that we fully understand the nature of the nomination
                process. Sectors were identified, applications were invited, and
                interview panels were set up.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister said that it would be
                inappropriate to give a specific body like Grand Lodge power to
                nominate. We understand that. However, he is missing the point.
                The reality is that having appointed someone — and I make no
                comment or cast any aspersions whatsoever on the integrity or
                ability of the person appointed by the First Minister — who
                would be representative of the Orange Order, it would have been
                appropriate for the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister
                to have looked at who had applied for membership from within
                Orange ranks. At least two members of the Grand Orange Lodge of
                Ireland applied for membership of the Civic Forum. They were
                unsuccessful, but it was open to the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister to look at those applications and say
                &quot;If we are going to appoint somebody who knows about Orange
                views, who is representative of the Orange Order, we will
                appoint someone from Grand Lodge.&quot;</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have often heard it said that people
                should be appointed to various groups by a process of
                consultation, that what that group or sector thinks itself
                should be taken on board. You should empower groups so they have
                a real role to play, but the First Minister and the Deputy First
                Minister are saying &quot;We know better than the Grand Orange
                Lodge as to who should be representative of Orange views.&quot;
                That is not acceptable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By not appointing a member of Grand Lodge to
                the Civic Forum they have done the Orange Order, one of the
                largest Protestant and Unionist groupings in Northern Ireland, a
                grave disservice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I note that the Deputy First Minister said
                that there would be a review of the operation of the Civic Forum
                12 months after its appointment. I also note that the Deputy
                First Minister, in saying that the Civic Forum should reflect
                all views in Northern Ireland, said</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;I ask the Assembly to accept that, and
                if I am wrong I will make the matter right very quickly.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appeal to the Office of the First Minister
                and the Deputy First Minister to have a review in less than 12
                months, in view of that statement made by the Deputy First
                Minister a couple of weeks ago, to see if this matter can be put
                right quickly. If they refuse to review the matter, that will
                compound the error they made in the first place. This is an
                important matter. There are many people in the community we
                represent who are very resentful that an ex-terrorist can be
                appointed to the Civic Forum. Those representing few people in
                Northern Ireland have been appointed, and yet an organisation
                that speaks for tens of thousands of people and has contributed
                a lot to the Protestant community over the years has been
                completely ignored.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I find myself in a fairly unusual position.
                With the possible exception of the junior Minister, who will be
                speaking on behalf of the Executive, I may well be the only
                Ulster Unionist to speak in this debate. I am also in the very
                unusual position of advising the First Minister to review the
                situation and his previous decision, which is something
                unnatural to me.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In supporting the motion I have to declare
                that I regard myself as agnostic at best on the benefits of the
                Civic Forum. Down the years, Northern Ireland has been ruled too
                much by quangos, and the creation of another quango at public
                expense concerns me. Whatever the criticisms of the Assembly
                are, its advantage is that it has been elected by the people of
                Northern Ireland, and if we reach another Assembly election, the
                people will be able to give their verdict on individual
                politicians. The same will not be the case with the Civic Forum
                — it does not have that same representative quality.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having got a Civic Forum we need to have it
                strive to be reflective and representative of society in
                Northern Ireland. While the Executive will carry a certain
                amount of baggage, the Civic Forum, if it operates correctly,
                will be able to command the respect and support of the whole of
                Northern Ireland. This is one of my reasons for supporting the
                motion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Within the Orange Order is a community
                principally drawn from a Unionist society that feels
                disillusioned and aggrieved with this process. It is up to the
                Civic Forum to ensure that it commands the support of a lot of
                those people. I am disconcerted by the fact that an organisation
                as large and important within the political life — indeed the
                entire life — of Northern Ireland as the Orange Order is not
                officially represented. To be able to provide a true reflection
                of society here there needs to be at least one representative
                from Grand Lodge.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The key word in this motion is
                representative. It could be argued, and has been argued by the
                First Minister when this matter has been raised, that he himself
                selected and appointed a member of the Orange Order. I cast no
                aspersions on the abilities of Richard Monteith, who is a good
                advocate for the Unionist and Orange cause, but the reality is
                that he is not there as a representative — he is an appointee
                who happens to be an Orangeman. Let us look at the other
                sectors. There are people representing the trade union sector;
                there are also people representing other sectors who are trade
                unionists, but are not there as representatives of the trade
                unions. There are two people representing victims, and I would
                be surprised if among the other 58 members there was not at
                least one who has been a victim in some way. Various people, who
                are in the Civic Forum through other routes, can also reflect a
                different point of view. The fact that someone who has been
                appointed also happens to be a member of the Orange Order does
                not ultimately make him a representative of the Order. That is
                the crucial difference.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister and the Deputy First
                Minister should take this opportunity to look at the overall
                make-up of the Civic Forum. By necessity, it was delegated to
                various sectors to nominate members. The one disadvantage in
                that is that the situation in Northern Ireland as a whole is not
                reflected.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I urge the First Minister to evaluate the
                situation in order to ensure there is direct representation from
                the Grand Orange Lodge. It is important to see the wider picture
                and to understand where the weaknesses in the Civic Forum are
                with regard to representation. The First Minister must ensure
                that new proposals are brought before the Assembly, perhaps to
                expand the number of people in the Civic Forum so that it fully
                represents Northern Ireland society. Whatever our feelings about
                its initial set-up we should have a Civic Forum that fully
                reflects the views, and carries the respect, of all the people
                in Northern Ireland. I urge Members to support the motion.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I oppose the motion. It is a typically
                opportunistic motion from the DUP and is a case of closing the
                stable door after the horse has bolted. The DUP, in keeping with
                its negative attitude to the institutions set up by the Good
                Friday Agreement, did not participate in the cross-party study
                group that was set up to advise the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister on the composition of the Civic Forum.
                However, now it is giving its views on that forum.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is another reason why this motion is so
                fundamentally dishonest. Not only was the DUP opposed to the
                institutions set up under the agreement, it was particularly
                opposed to the idea of the Civic Forum from the outset. I quote
                from a statement issued by Mr Paisley Jnr on 25 September, the
                day the membership of the Civic Forum was announced in this
                Chamber. These are some of the pejorative phrases he used to
                describe the Civic Forum: &quot;the cronies Forum;&quot;
                &quot;nodding dogs;&quot; &quot;yes men;&quot; &quot;a comfort
                blanket for the pro-Agreement parties;&quot; &quot;a toothless
                wonder&quot;. Despite this, DUP Members have come to the
                Assembly today to demand seats for the Orange Order. It puts me
                in mind of a line from Groucho Marx:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;I don’t want to belong to any club
                that will accept me as a member&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In his statement, Mr Paisley Jnr also
                complained that there are too many trade unionists in the forum,
                that voluntary groups have double the representation of business
                and agriculture, and that the number of the First and the Deputy
                First Minister’s appointees is triple the number of victims’
                representatives. However, there is not a word in that statement
                about the alleged under-representation of the Orange Order. What
                has changed in the last month? The first time I heard the DUP
                mention the Orange Order with reference to membership of the
                forum was in this Chamber when the membership was announced.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is another matter, which is one that
                only the Orange Order itself can decide. This relates to whether
                the Orange Order is a religious, a political, or a cultural
                organisation. If the Order has applied for membership of the
                forum, under which heading has it applied? If it has not
                applied, why not? The Civic Forum is a body, which, as the
                Deputy First Minister said, should represent all views. Indeed
                he is on record as saying that he would have welcomed a
                recommendation from the Orange Order, or from the Apprentice
                Boys. The Civic Forum is not bureaucratic. There are many
                imaginative independent thinkers who will discuss and debate the
                thorny issues of this society such as the transfer test, the
                relationship between poverty and ill health, sectarianism, the
                economy, and many other issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The SDLP wholeheartedly supports the purpose
                of the Civic Forum. We believe that it has a very positive role
                to play in the public life of Northern Ireland. It will also
                foster pluralism and diversity. It will, through time, prove its
                worth to all. This is the first opportunity for civic society to
                take ownership of the peace process and to have its voice
                clearly heard.</p>

                My initial reaction on seeing this motion was that maybe it had
                some merit. Exposure to wider civic society and to a diversity
                of people and views might help to open some minds. On
                reflection, the reality is that the Orange Order is beyond
                redemption in this regard.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are any number of groups, many of them
                of a much more benign and positive nature, who could ask for
                special treatment. Why should the Orange Order be given special
                treatment on the Civic Forum, especially given the nature of
                that organisation? For centuries, the Orange Order has had an
                undue and malign influence throughout society in the North of
                Ireland — in Unionist political parties, the judiciary, the
                police force and in business. These are positions of power and
                influence. How many members of the Civic Forum are already
                members of the Orange Order? Indeed, how many Members of this
                Assembly are members of the Orange Order?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Orange Order is a sectarian and racist
                organisation. This motion is akin to asking the Ku Klux Klan to
                make a positive contribution to American society. It is very
                telling that, last year, a Ku Klux Klan spokesman stated that
                his organisation was concerned at being compared with the Orange
                Order. The Orange Order’s <i>raison d’être</i> is to keep
                Fenians in their place. I will not go into the history of its
                bloody birth at the Battle of the Diamond, or the widespread
                disruption, murder and mayhem that have accompanied Orange
                marches and parades ever since. Everyone in Ireland, especially
                on the Garvaghy and Ormeau Roads, and throughout the world,
                knows only too well the Orange Order’s negative and malign
                influence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For example, who will forget the disgraceful
                scenes at an Orange Order parade on the Ormeau&nbsp;Road when
                participants laughed, jeered and celebrated the murder of five
                people from the local community in Sean P Graham’s bookmaker’s
                shop? Who could ever tolerate the ongoing brutalisation and
                intimidation of the Garvaghy Road community in Portadown in
                order to facilitate a swaggering, triumphalist Orange Order
                parade through an inoffensive minority community?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Good Friday Agreement and its
                institutions, including the Civic Forum, are supposed to be
                about a new way of organising society — not a mere replication
                of the old, failed ways of the past. Members of the Orange Order
                have no positive contribution to make to the Civic Forum. It is
                a secret society. It is not just any old benign secret society
                whose members wear funny hats, carry swords and engage in
                strange rituals, although members of the Orange Order
                undoubtedly do all of those things. The Orange Order is a
                sectarian and racist organisation founded on hatred of anything
                Catholic or Irish. It is an organisation that foments and
                fosters inequality and division in our society. One only has to
                read some of the words of Orange tunes — &quot;We’re up to
                our necks in Fenian blood. Surrender or you’ll die.&quot; —
                to see how offensive the Orange Order and its philosophy are.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This motion has more to do with the divisions
                in Unionism and the DUP’s attempts to show how much more
                Unionist it is. The hypocrisy of this motion is appalling,
                although it is what we have come to expect from the DUP in this
                Assembly. It is appalling because the Orange Order, with the
                help of loyalist paramilitaries, has succeeded in tearing civic
                society apart for the last five years in their futile and
                dangerous attempt to march along the Garvaghy Road.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Orange Order refuses to speak to those
                who disagree with it. Not only do its members refuse to talk to
                Nationalist residents and their chosen representatives, but they
                also refuse to talk to the Northern Ireland Parades Commission.
                The DUP puts down a motion asking for special and preferential
                treatment for such an organisation —</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The decision to exclude the Orange Order from
                membership of the Civic Forum demonstrates a bias against the
                huge section of the Protestant community that belongs to that
                organisation. It graphically illustrates that the Civic Forum
                lacks credibility and that its apparent inclusivity extends —
                with a few exceptions — only to those people who follow the
                Government’s pro-agreement line. It is clear that despite the
                Orange Order’s huge membership — and I have no apology for
                being a member — it has been excluded because of its
                opposition to the Belfast Agreement. What other reason can there
                be for excluding it from membership of the Civic Forum?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are people who try to demonise the
                Orange Order, and we have just heard five minutes of sheer black
                propaganda. I want to counter that with the truth about the
                Orange Order. The Orange Order has, from its earliest
                beginnings, given leadership at all levels of society. It is a
                Christian organisation and has included in its membership
                ministers of religion, bishops, moderators, mayors, councillors,
                politicians and even the First Minister. It would be interesting
                to know whether the previous speaker is now accusing the First
                Minister of racism. Members can be found serving their community
                in all walks of life. The Orange Order has members both male and
                female, young and old, in many countries including England,
                Scotland, Wales, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Togo, Ghana and
                the USA.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Traditionally the Orange Order is seen as a
                marching organisation. Much work goes on unseen, such as caring
                for orphans and supporting widows. The Orange Order has also
                supported numerous good causes including hospitals and hospices,
                as well as a multitude of charities and missions. That is in
                addition to individual contributions by many members.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">More recently the Orange Order has embarked
                on aid to churches in Eastern Europe and support for modern
                communication of the gospel overseas. The Orange Order has been
                encouraging young people, through bursaries, to develop their
                own business, commercial and industrial skills in order to
                improve the economy of Northern Ireland — unlike Sinn Féin/IRA,
                which for 30 years has terrorised this community, attacking over
                250 Orange halls and destroying many businesses.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Orange Order stands for civil and
                religious liberties for all and is committed to Christian
                principles and the gospel message. The Orange Order’s ideals
                are far above any that the so-called Civic Forum may have or
                claim to stand for. The Civic Forum lacks credibility, as it
                does not truly reflect civic society and is not inclusive. The
                Orange Order will continue to prosper and stand firm for its
                principles, as it has done for many years, while the Civic Forum
                will, I suggest, last only a matter of weeks.</p>

                Members of why the Orange Order wishes to have a place in the
                Civic Forum, given its opposition to the Belfast Agreement. I
                remind Members that on 12&nbsp;July 1998 we stated from all

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have listened with interest to the debate.
                Sadly, one of the Members for Upper Bann is not present in the
                Chamber. I was saddened to listen to Ms Hanna’s comments
                earlier. Clearly, no account has been taken of the fact that the
                Orange Order is one of the largest organisations in Northern
                Ireland and certainly encompasses all shades of Unionism.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is well and good for the First Minister,
                when he announced his nominations, and for Mr Richard Monteith,
                who is a solicitor acting on behalf of Portadown District. On
                that occasion the First Minister attempted to justify the
                appointment of Mr Monteith as a back-door representation for the
                Order. However, it is quite plain that Mr Monteith is there in
                his own capacity as a member of the Civic Forum. He cannot speak
                on behalf of the Orange Order because he is not a member of the
                Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Orange Institution will not be sneaking
                in through the back door of this Forum as if it is in some sort
                of shame. The Orange Institution deserves and should be afforded
                official representation. At the time of the nominations the
                First Minister assured us that each of the three nominations he
                made was</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;specifically to ensure that balance and
                inclusion did occur.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There can be no balance and inclusion when
                the epitome of Protestant culture and heritage is omitted from
                the list.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Contrary to what Carmel Hanna said, the
                Orange Institution did go through the proper channels. When we
                approached the Office of the First Minister we were told how to
                apply, and I am aware of at least two members of the Grand
                Orange Lodge of Ireland who applied for positions on the Civic
                Forum and were unsuccessful. I understand that there are two
                members of the Civic Forum who may be members of the Orange
                Institution — and we congratulate them on their appointment
                — but they are not there to represent the views of the Grand
                Orange Lodge of Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom
                has recognised on numerous occasions that the Orange Order is
                important in the community and has a role to play in the civic
                society of Northern Ireland. It is widely acknowledged, even by
                those opposed to the Orange Order and by Members of the House,
                that the Order is the largest social provider in the Protestant
                community. Many community audits clearly show how important
                Orange halls are to the life of our local communities, often
                forming the heart of them. Community audits recognise that, but
                unfortunately the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister
                choose to ignore it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Orange Order is saddened that it does not
                have a place on the Civic Forum. It has been subject to the
                worst kind of black propaganda and we have listened to it here
                again today. It is equalled only by the vilification of the RUC.
                The political process has attempted to make the Orange Order and
                its members distasteful to the wider public. Our institution has
                been reviled and maligned by misinformation and
                misrepresentation by those who know nothing about its make-up or
                its principles and, worse still, by those who do.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Orange Order should have the right to
                speak. It is owed the right to reply. It deserves the chance to
                have its voice heard, and apparently the place to do so is the
                Civic Forum. This morning the Orange Order received a letter

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ervine:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I rise with some reluctance to speak on this
                issue. I am a member of the Protestant community; I am not a
                member of the Orange Order, but many members of my party are. If
                they had been listening in the Chamber today, they would have
                felt insulted on two counts, and probably more.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One severely unbalanced comment — one of
                the most sectarian comments that I have ever heard in the
                Chamber — was made by the Member for Upper Bann, Dara O’Hagan.
                It is insulting for her simply to write off, in the manner that
                she did, those whom she does not understand or disagrees with,
                whether or not those people will talk to her. That in itself is
                sectarian. To some degree she is right to chastise the DUP for
                carrying the cudgel on behalf of the Orange Order, but
                considering her political requirements it is somewhat
                hypocritical.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It might be worth pointing out that the
                leader of the PUP, Cllr Hugh Smyth OBE, has been a member of the
                Orange Order for more than 50 years. When the Orange Order
                declared itself to be anti-agreement, no one asked him for his
                opinion. No one asked anyone in his Lodge for their opinion. The
                Grand Master of the Orange Lodge, a decent man who I know very
                well, stood with political forces arrayed against the Good
                Friday Agreement. I feel that, tragically, as we approached the
                referendum day and stood hand in hand, he changed the context of
                the Orange Order as I had always understood it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, as I did not move in the hallowed
                halls of power or in the halls of justice and just lived in the
                streets of Belfast, I have no sense of anger, hurt or
                frustration towards the Orange Order. I feel a sense of affinity
                and appreciation, because its members lived in my home, lived
                next door to me and lived in the next street — I associated
                with them all day, every day. The suggestion that there was
                manipulation in our society in the past resonates with me, but
                it has to be placed on record that one side has simply
                castigated and vilified the Orange Order without realising the
                decency and integrity of the ordinary people who are members of
                it. At the same time, the only hope that this society has for
                its future has been vilified, without the membership of the
                Orange Order — who undoubtedly disagree in large numbers with
                the leadership — being questioned, debated with and consulted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would welcome the Orange Order having
                membership of the Civic Forum, but the Orange Order has a
                responsibility to define its political and religious outlooks.
                Peter&nbsp;Weir described it as a group with great political
                significance, but he should have said that it has great social
                significance. He described it as a political organisation. All
                those who are not members have a big fear about the manipulation
                of the Orange Order.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Until Mr&nbsp;Watson spoke I was confused
                about the procedures that the Orange Order had followed to
                ensure that it had seats on the Civic Forum. That point needs to
                be addressed in the debate, although I am pleased to hear that
                its participation has been enthusiastically followed. During the
                negotiations I put forward the idea of a Civic Forum, and I
                recall that some people were very disparaging about it. I am
                often chastised by DUP Members for putting forward confused
                arguments. Until Mr&nbsp;Watson spoke, I was slightly confused
                about the position taken by the proposer of the motion — the
                DUP is against something but is still very anxious to ensure
                places on it. Peter&nbsp;Weir said, though not in these words,
                that it was the democratic wish that there should be a Civic
                Forum and, as one had been established, the Orange Order should
                have membership of it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall leave that aside, because there is
                much confusion about whether the Orange Order wanted membership
                of the Forum. I, along with Carmel&nbsp;Hanna and others,
                participated in some of the negotiations on who should be
                represented on the Civic&nbsp;Forum. It was decided that there
                would be a sector representing cultural organisations. Last
                February it was agreed that there would be such representation
                and that would be agreed through the Cultural Traditions
                committee of the Community Relations Council. My understanding
                is that a public advertisement was placed in the papers inviting
                people to sit on a nominating consortium. Some groups responded
                and six were put on the consortium, although not all took their
                places. The Orange Order, as an institution, did not apply to
                become a member of the nominating consortium.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After the consortium had been established,
                another advertisement was placed inviting persons to apply for
                membership of the Forum. Those who applied had to follow an
                interview process. Four persons were appointed, including at
                least one who is a member of the Orange Order, but not a nominee
                of that institution. He represents the Ulster-Scots in the
                cultural sector. Once again, however, no formal Orange Order
                nominations were received in response to the second public
                advertisement. Everyone knew about the advertisement. One would
                have thought that representatives of a cultural institution that
                had not already applied would have taken that opportunity to
                apply to become part of a consortium. However, they did not do
                so.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As far as I understand the situation — and
                perhaps the proposer will come back to this point at the end of
                the debate — the Orange Order, as an institution, did not
                propose any members. So it was a wasted opportunity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Surely, they are not telling us that not
                having gone through the most transparent and accountable method
                of selection they then went to the Office of the First Minister,
                which I think is what Mr Watson was saying in his speech. They
                had not got their &quot;act&quot; together as far as making
                those nominations was concerned, unlike everyone else who had a
                fair and equal opportunity. Denis uses the word,
                &quot;fair&quot; in relation to the institution. The institution
                itself would probably feel that that was the fair and
                appropriate method of applying.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is unfair to suggest that you should go to
                the Office of the First Minister and seek preferential
                treatment. Members who were party to the negotiations will
                remember that when we asked the Office of the First Minister and
                Deputy First Minister to make nominations it was with a view to
                those organisations that had not been named and who actually
                felt that there was no place for them. That is my understanding
                of how some of these people were nominated by the Office of the
                Centre.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also very pleased that Denis Watson says
                that the Orange Order statement in July referred to their desire
                that the country should be well governed, fair and peaceful. If
                they had been members of the Civic Forum that would indeed take
                place. Last July left us with a desperate feeling in this
                country that whatever happened we were not well governed, and it
                certainly was not fair and peaceful.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I feel compelled to tackle two points. The
                first relates to the comments made by the lead Sinn Féin
                speaker, and the second relates to the coherence of this motion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, with respect to first Sinn Féin
                speaker and indeed the rather colourful comparison between the
                Orange Order and the Ku Klux Klan. That was unfair and
                unhelpful. If we had time — and it probably would not be
                helpful but it would perhaps not be unreasonable — we could
                trace the antecedents of our own party and some of the rather
                unpleasant far right neo-fascist groups in continental Europe
                that Sinn Féin have been associated with over the years. The
                brush of racism can tar in a number of directions and Members
                who charge the Orange Order with that particular position need
                to examine the beam in their own ideological eye.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, as regards the motion lacking
                coherence. As far as I can see, there is in fact no appropriate
                and immediate action that can be taken by the Office of First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister. Therefore, this motion
                is asking for something that, in any case. cannot be done. Of
                course the proposers will undoubtedly say that it is the Ulster
                Unionist Party’s fault for structuring the Civic Forum in that
                way in the first place. The response to that is that this is yet
                another case where the Democratic Unionist Party and others
                absented themselves from the negotiations and then feel that
                they can carp about the results of those negotiations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As has been pointed out already, there are a
                number of Orange Order members in the Civic Forum. Given that it
                is an organisation with between 40,000 to 80,000 members on the
                island, it is entirely appropriate that that block of so-called
                civic society should be represented. Undoubtedly there will be
                problems in the structure of the Civic Forum — there always
                are when new institutions are set up. I am not just thinking
                about the representation given to the various cultural
                organisations — there are broader issues. These problems can
                be addressed in the review of the Civic Forum, which I
                understand will occur one year after its onset of operation.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If evidence were required to show that the
                Orange Order should have been appointed to the Civic Forum,
                perhaps it is in today’s debate; particularly after comments
                from those representing the Nationalist community in this
                Assembly. Ms Carmel Hanna, who I deem to be a very reasonable
                Nationalist, clearly does not understand the Orange Order, its
                workings, or what it is about. Obviously, representatives of the
                Orange Order will not have the opportunity, in the Civic Forum,
                to help other diverse groups in the community to know exactly
                what it is about.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As for Sinn Féin, I do not expect anything
                else from them. To talk about everyone else being bloodthirsty,
                racist, and bigoted is somewhat farcical given their track
                record in this Province over the past 30 years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would return to Mr Mallon’s comments in
                relation to the establishment and representation on the Civic
                Forum:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;We will ensure that the Forum has the
                appropriate balance to enable it to represent fully all sections
                in Northern Ireland.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a very clear statement; &quot;all
                sections in Northern Ireland&quot;. The Orange Order
                subsequently went through the process of applying for membership
                of the Civic Forum. Whether you agree with the body is
                immaterial, the fact is that they applied for membership. We do
                not agree with the structures of the Belfast Agreement — this
                Assembly is one of those structures — but we went to the
                people, were elected to this Assembly, and so we are entitled to
                be here. The Orange Order put its name forward for
                representation on the Civic Forum despite disagreeing with the
                structures brought about by the Belfast Agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In my view it is arrogant of Mr Trimble and
                Mr Mallon to say that they have appointed members of the Orange
                Order and that that representation is sufficient. It smacks of
                what Sir Reg Empey did when he appointed Mr Bertie Kerr as
                chairman of the Food Safety Board. In that instance he indicated
                that a farming representative should be appointed as chairman,
                but he did not ask the Northern Ireland Agricultural Producers’
                Association (NIAPA) to put representatives forward; he decided
                who would be the best person to represent the farming community.
                In this instance, Mr Trimble has shown a great degree of
                arrogance in that his decision as to who should represent the
                Orange Order is above what the Orange Order would wish for
                itself.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been a constant attack on the
                Protestant culture, the Orange culture, and on the Unionist
                culture. Mr Ervine talked about the social importance of the
                Orange Order: it has a religious importance, a political
                importance, a social importance and a cultural importance.
                Eighty thousand men belong to the organisation. Many women and
                young people also support the organisation although they are not
                members. For people to demean the Orange Order and write it off
                as being something like the Ku Klux Klan shows a severe lack of
                understanding of what the Orange Order is.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to Ms Hanna’s comment that the
                DUP wants to bar the door after the horse has bolted, Mr&nbsp;McGrady
                said on 16 February 1999 that the DUP had been complaining about
                the potential composition of the Civic Forum and not about the
                principle of the Forum. So we are not complaining after the
                event, we were complaining before the event. We sent out early
                signals that this might well happen and, in this instance, it
                has. Our voice has been ignored; the voices of those within the
                Assembly opposed to the Belfast Agreement have been ignored, and
                the voice of the Orange Order has been ignored.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, I believe the Orange Order
                should have been entitled to a place in the Civic Forum. The
                First Minister and the Deputy First Minister must look at this
                matter again. It is not fair to write off such a substantial
                section of our community while we can have the Irish language,
                Gaelic associations and other exclusive organisations from the
                Nationalist community represented.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Nelis:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat. That this motion came
                from the DUP must have raised a smile—if not outright laughter
                — from other Members. The &quot;No&quot; camp said
                &quot;No&quot; to the Civic Forum. Now, they want the Assembly
                — in particular, Members from all the parties that worked long
                and hard to make the Civic Forum a reality — to urge the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister to appoint a
                representative to the Forum. Are they really saying
                &quot;Yes&quot; to something, at last?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The following sectors were invited to set up
                consortia that would be responsible for shortlisting candidates
                and ensuring a balance of gender, community background,
                geographical spread and age among nominees: business,
                agriculture and fisheries, trade unions, voluntary community
                work, churches, culture, arts, sports, victims, community
                relations, education and the Office of the First Minister and
                Deputy First Minister. The DUP, who rubbished the Civic Forum,
                now wants to add another sector — the Grand Orange Lodge of
                Ireland — so that that organisation can be represented. Did
                the consortiums that came together from all the sectors of civic
                society that I have mentioned to nominate representatives to the
                Forum think so little of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland that
                they did not consider anyone from that organisation to be worthy
                of nomination? Perhaps, the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland is
                fully represented by nominations from the various sectoral
                nominees. Maybe, they are in the closet and have just not come
                out yet. That may happen at the next meeting of the Civic Forum;
                they might don their bowler hats and collarettes and proclaim
                that they are really members of the Grand Orange Lodge. Or does
                the motion mean that the DUP is under orders to support the
                Civic Forum, lest it become — in its warped analysis —
                another concession to Republicans? Do the Grand Orange Lodge and
                the DUP think that the Civic Forum — whatever its democratic
                limitations — could become a stabilising influence in their
                wee Province, where consensus politics is a new experience?
                Perhaps, they want to make sure that that does not happen.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The DUP’s contribution to civic society has
                been limited to brandishing Union Jacks and attacking everyone
                who disagrees with them. Our response to the motion is &quot;if
                you are not in, you can’t win&quot;. More fundamentally, the
                Civic Forum should not have within it any group with the title
                &quot;Grand&quot;. Equality must be the cornerstone of civic
                society. Go raibh maith agat.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hilditch:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will get back to reality. I urge the First
                Minister and Deputy First Minister to seize the opportunity to
                appoint a representative of the Grand Lodge of Ireland to the
                Civic Forum immediately. The motion gives us the opportunity to
                expose the nonsense peddled by the pro-agreement parties that
                the Belfast Agreement is an all-inclusive agreement and that the
                Civic Forum would give representation to spokespersons from all
                walks of society, including churches, cultural and community
                groupings. Once again, the Unionist community has been
                discriminated against by the refusal of the Office of the First
                Minister and Deputy First Minister to include a representative
                of the Grand Lodge of Ireland on the Civic Forum.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Orange family in Northern Ireland extends
                to approximately one quarter of a million people, and is one of
                the largest religious and cultural groupings in the Province.
                That the Order was not offered at least one representative on
                the Civic Forum is a snub to its members and our community. Once
                again, it demonstrates clearly that the Belfast Agreement has
                nothing to offer the law-abiding, decent citizens who had the
                forethought to say &quot;No&quot; to the policy of appeasement
                of IRA/Sinn Féin.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We would not expect the Deputy First Minister
                to value the Orange Institution. We condemn the part that he and
                other senior members of the SDLP have played in trying to
                demonise the Order, while supporting moves to get the armed wing
                of the pan-Nationalist front into Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, we expected the First Minister to
                openly acknowledge the Orange family, membership of which he
                used to launch his political career and become Leader of the
                Ulster Unionist Party. This is a position which, I have no
                doubt, will come to an abrupt end soon. Alas, he appears to have
                as much commitment to the Orange Institution as he has shown
                himself to have for his election manifesto. He has broken
                promise after promise.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Prime Minister, Mr Tony Blair, publicly
                stated that he values the important role of the Orange
                Institution in Northern Ireland life. Does the First Minister
                also value the very important role that the Orange Order plays
                in Northern Ireland life? If so, why should he have the
                effrontery to fail to offer it a place on the Civic Forum? Mr
                Trimble does not appear to value its important role in Northern
                Ireland. After all, he is leading a charge in his party to
                reduce, and ultimately sever, the links with it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Furthermore, there is the case of Portadown
                District No 1 on Drumcree Hill, whose members are denied their
                civil and religious liberties, refused access to the Queen’s
                highway and prevented from returning home from worship, all at
                the behest of IRA/Sinn Féin. If the First Minister was
                genuinely interested in the Orange Institution, would this
                situation have been allowed to continue for so long? I suspect
                that the Orangemen on Drumcree Hill are paying the price for
                saying &quot;No&quot; to the Belfast Agreement. By not offering
                the institution a place on the Civic Forum, David Trimble is
                carrying out a petty vendetta against it, because it stood
                firmly against a sell-out of the Ulster people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Belfast Agreement discriminates against
                law-abiding people. It has constantly rewarded those who use
                violence, threaten violence, show no remorse, show no intention
                of mending their ways, and show no regard for those who have
                exercised their democratic right to say &quot;No&quot;. The
                Civic Forum has been gerrymandered to exclude all but the
                &quot;Yes&quot; men. This is the democracy that David Trimble
                and Co call &quot;all-inclusive&quot;.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wanted to expose the nonsense and lies
                peddled by the pro-agreement parties — that the Belfast
                Agreement is an all-inclusive agreement — and I have used the
                example of the Civic Forum to demonstrate that the Office of the
                First Minister and the Deputy First Minister discriminate
                against an enormous section of the Unionist community to further
                its political agenda.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the difficulties that I had with the
                agreement was that it allowed all the evil elements of our
                society — murderers, thugs, gangsters, racketeers and drug
                dealers — to sit in the Government of our country. I feel sick
                in my stomach today when I listen to the representatives of
                those people lecturing me, as an Orangeman, on what my rights
                are. I say at the outset, I do not belong to any secret society,
                and I do not belong to any racist group. To suggest that the
                Orange Order is a racist organisation is to tell a blatant lie.
                Lodges in Africa, born out of the zeal of missionaries who went
                out there, have brought the gospel to many coloured people. I
                have heard nonsense today from people who know nothing about my
                culture or my history. They know only that they want to beat us
                into the ground and take from us our history and culture. I do
                not want to hear this nonsense; I want justice in this debate
                for the Orange Order — what is right and just for what I
                represent.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no justice in this proposal. We hear
                so much about equality, but what is meant by that? This
                so-called equality discriminates against me, as a representative
                of the majority community. An attack on the Orange Order is an
                attack on the Protestant community and on the Unionist community
                itself. We should never forget it, but that is what we have
                heard today. David Ervine was right. We heard a sectarian attack
                from someone whose background hardly justifies attacking other
                Members or the groups which they represent. An injustice has
                been done, whether or not one likes the Orange Order.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I represent a broad section of the Protestant
                community. It is larger than any church, sporting organisation
                or political party, but it is not represented in the Civic
                Forum. Yes, members of the Civic Forum may be members of the
                institution, but the Orange Order itself is not officially
                recognised or represented there. Therefore, that injustice
                against the Institution and the Protestant and the Unionist
                community needs to be rectified. The non-participation of the
                Orange Order in the Civic Forum represents discrimination
                against it, even though that body of opinion represents the
                interests of some 80,000 people plus their families in this
                community. The Orange Order is far reaching, stretching into 11
                countries and it is time that was recognised.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us do away with the nonsense that we hear
                about the Orange Order. For goodness’ sake, those who do not
                like us and do not know what we represent should learn a little
                bit about us, speak to us and read about us. We have only to
                look at recent history to know the background of some of those
                people across the way and where they are coming from. That is
                living history, and we know what it represents — death,
                destruction, bombing and murder, yet we have had to listen to
                this drivel today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am no great lover of quangos or civic
                forums. I believe in democracy, although I am prepared to work
                systems, even though I do not particularly like them. However,
                the Civic Forum was established through the Belfast Agreement
                and it has to be representative of all the interests in the
                community. The Orange Order is more representative of the
                Protestant community than any other individual or group on the
                Civic Forum. Various bodies and groups may be represented, but
                what do they represent? Only some groups and, in some instances,
                nothing but themselves and the Orange Order has blatantly been
                discriminated against through this process. I have no difficulty
                whatsoever in lending my support to this Motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Berry:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome this Motion. At the outset, I
                declare my interest as a member of the Loyal Institution and one
                who is proud to be so. There is no doubt that there is a great
                imbalance in the Civic Forum and there should be proper
                representation on behalf of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland.
                It has been pointed out clearly that it is one of the largest
                organisations across Northern Ireland. Sadly it has been
                under-represented because of its lack of involvement in the
                Civic Forum.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although some Members seem to have ignored
                his remarks Mr Dodds, who tabled this Motion made it clear that
                although we were against the Civic Forum it is in place and we
                believe in our hearts that the Orange Institution should be
                represented. We do not like its make-up or the fact that it was
                brought into being, but now that it is there, it is important
                that members of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland should be
                fully represented.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many people are not aware of what the Orange
                Institution stands for. We have listened to various members
                today, but one — Dr Dara O’Hagan — was quite sectarian.
                The Orange Institution is not just about marching around this
                country. It is our right to march to express our culture and
                heritage, and that has a lot of positive aspects. On many
                occasions Orange halls across Northern Ireland have held
                fund-raising events for charities namely Cystic Fibrosis Trust
                and Action Cancer. At the weekend I shall attend a fund-raising
                function for health charities at an Orange hall.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Orange Order also holds church services
                across Northern Ireland. Those are positive contributions that
                it has made in Northern Ireland, although we are often demonised
                by the enemies of Ulster.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Orange activities are not just for the
                Protestant community. Children’s meetings held in Orange halls
                are open to everybody in the community; gospel missions are open
                to everybody in the community; there are youth clubs and
                community events — the list goes on. The Orange Order has been
                very positive in Northern Ireland over a number of years. It is
                a positive organisation that has stood up for truth and
                righteousness in this country.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We firmly believe that the Orange Order has
                been shunned by the First Minister and the Deputy First
                Minister, and that should be rectified today. As Members of the
                Assembly we demand that this matter be reviewed with urgency.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Orange Order has suffered greatly over
                the past 30 years. We have had our Orange halls attacked. Orange
                members have been murdered simply because they were members of
                the Orange Institution. I think of Tullyvallen in my
                constituency. We have suffered so much, yet we are not
                represented properly on the Civic Forum. It is most important
                that our views and concerns are heard, and for that to happen,
                we must be represented on the Civic Forum.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our enemies can point to things that have
                happened — indeed, things that should not have happened —
                within the institution. One Member referred to the incident on
                the Ormeau Road that happened in relation to the murder of those
                people at the bookie’s shop. I have no doubt that all Members
                in this Chamber who are members of the Orange Institution
                condemn what happened on the Ormeau Road. We do not stand up for
                those people who put up their hands and chanted as they were
                walking along the Ormeau Road. I was totally disgusted when I
                saw that happening. That does not represent the views of the
                vast majority of the Orange Institution. However its enemies are
                quick to point out any fault and wrongdoing. The Orange
                Institution has been one of the largest and most positive
                organisations in Northern Ireland and, without it this country
                would be in a much worse state today. It must be represented.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Madam Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remind Members that when comments are

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs E Bell:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As always, I will try to keep to the wording
                of the motion, although I confess that I am at a loss to see
                what the purpose of the motion is. Has the Grand Orange Lodge
                made its concerns known to the Office of the First Minister and
                the Deputy First Minister and to the Community Relations Council’s
                cultural traditions section? I have heard the concerns of
                members of the Orange Order and have asked Members from Mr Dodds’s
                party if the Grand Orange Lodge applied to be considered for
                nomination to the Civic Forum. I have been told by a number of
                people that it did not reply to the advertisement inviting
                applications.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The procedure for selection for nomination
                was, I believe, carried out in strict adherence to the Nolan
                principles. It would be very wrong specifically to invite now,
                as the motion is suggesting, one organisation, however strong it
                may be, to apply after the process has been gone through and the
                nomination list closed. I am not opposing the inclusion of the
                Grand Orange Lodge. What I am saying is that its inclusion
                should only come about with equity and through the observance of
                agreed procedures, so that no one feels discriminated against.
                What is proposed in this motion would patently not be in accord
                with those procedures.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the motion succeeds, and immediate steps
                are taken to appoint a representative, that will beset a
                dangerous precedent that will fly in the face of the Nolan
                principles. It could only result in a flow of similar
                applications from other organisations and individuals who were
                not selected and who feel just as strongly that they should have
                been.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not going to comment on the general
                make-up of the Civic Forum. Suffice it to say that, obviously, a
                lot of hard work has been done to create the most comprehensive
                and representative forum possible. It will have a heavy task in
                following a widespread programme of work, which should be
                relevant and complementary to the Assembly’s work. Throughout
                the troubles, one of the greatest weaknesses in our society has
                been the division between political and civic society. That is
                why my party has been supporting the idea of a civic forum since
                1988.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Civic Forum, if allowed, should reduce
                this weakness in Northern Ireland. It is vital that correct,
                transparent methods of selection be maintained at all times in
                all sectors of society. It is also essential that the Assembly
                set the right example with the establishment of the Civic Forum.
                I accept that it is unfortunate that such a significant and
                traditional organisation should not be admitted, but you can
                take a white horse to water.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I urge the Grand Lodge to ensure that its
                concerns are noted in the right places and to apply for
                membership when the Forum is reviewed in due course. I hope that
                it will then be included. For that reason, I cannot support this
                motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. In the past two years
                the people of Northern Ireland have been forced to stand by as
                David Trimble and his band of merry capitulators set about
                deconstructing the principles of Unionism upon which his party
                was once based. The latest phase of this grand plan of surrender
                has been the construction of a so-called Civic Forum. Purported
                to be consultative, the Civic Forum has been created to give
                businesses, trade unions and the voluntary sector a direct line
                into the Assembly. Nobody is being fooled about any aspect of
                the Belfast Agreement and the true thrust of the political
                process anymore.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Certain pro-agreement parties lauded the
                Belfast Agreement as a means of ridding Northern Ireland of its
                quango culture. However, in the very same breath they are
                breathing life into what is the biggest and most prominent
                quango to be launched in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This unelected, unaccountable body serves a
                two-fold purpose. First, it was designed as a safety net for the
                representatives of those organisations who played a crucial role
                in hoodwinking the Unionist electorate yet did not receive a
                democratic mandate in the referendum. Secondly, it is clear from
                the body’s make-up that it exists to support the pro-agreement
                stances of Nationalism and minority Unionism within the Assembly
                Chamber and in the Province.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As an integral part of the Belfast Agreement,
                the Forum was set up as a direct result of the pressure exerted
                through terrorist atrocity and crime. It exists solely to
                appease those who are committed to returning to violence, should
                concessions dry up. Never in the history of democracy has there
                been any political precedent for giving a place in a Government
                institution to those who use violence to undermine democratic
                liberties while retaining and retraining private armies. It is a
                practical and theoretical impossibility for such an institution
                to act as the foundation for any sort of democracy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The stark reality of the Civic Forum is that
                its membership has a 2:1 Nationalist/Unionist ratio. This is
                evidence of how the Forum and the agreement are devoid of
                democratic principle. Nationalism remains committed to
                undermining the authority of the Crown, the integrity of the
                United Kingdom and the legitimacy of British culture in Ulster.
                In practice, the Belfast Agreement was designed with the
                principles of Irish Nationalism in mind. This intolerance
                extends to the Civic Forum which, it is claimed, exists to
                accommodate cultural diversity, despite the fact there has been
                a failure officially to appoint a member of the largest cultural
                organisation in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Orange institution, wedded to the
                principles of democracy and liberty for all, does not merit
                inclusion under the agreement. To include it would be to accept
                and acknowledge the organisation, its principles and its right
                to cultural expression. This is not part of the Nationalist
                agenda so it is not a surprising development. It is symptomatic
                of the oft-mentioned new dispensation under which any majority,
                which has pro-democracy and pro-Union views, is disregarded as
                being unhelpful and is accused of seeking to return to what are
                referred to by some as &quot;the bad old days&quot;. What were
                those &quot;bad old days&quot;? Those were the days when a
                person was free to express his cultural identity peacefully,
                free from the grip of intolerance, free from intimidation and
                free from persecution. I take exception to some of the remarks
                that have been made here today in reference to people, such as
                the many law-abiding members of my lodge.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These law-abiding people, who have not even
                had so much as a parking ticket in their lives — in 30, 40, 70
                or 80 years — will all find remarks that have been made today
                scurrilous, aggressive, scandalous and hurtful. It is essential
                that one cultural identity in Northern Ireland be not promoted
                over and above another. Unfortunately, as long as Nationalism
                remains true to its elitist and sectarian principles, and while
                certain sections of Unionism are prepared to subscribe to the
                principles of surrender, our culture will never receive the
                parity or respect which is its due.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Civic Forum is just one more unnecessary
                layer of bureaucracy, created out of political expediency and
                draining the taxpayer of funds which should be diverted to a
                crumbling Health Service. The Civic Forum exists only as part
                and parcel of a greater plan to maintain a situation in which
                IRA/Sinn Féin does not feel the need to put bombs in London to
                force its political agenda. Mr Trimble has stumbled, jumped and
                scrambled throughout the process, and he has now fallen flat on
                his face. The Civic Forum is just one more blunder.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Junior Minister (Office of First and Deputy
                First Ministers) (Mr Nesbitt):</b> The debate has been
                interesting and quite wide ranging this afternoon. I wish to
                make some general comments on matters of principle which have
                permeated the discussion. The Civic Forum is one of the
                institutions of the Belfast Agreement, and, like it or not, the
                Belfast Agreement is about inclusiveness. It is about having
                institutions in Northern Ireland to which the vast majority of
                people can feel an affinity and an allegiance. That is what we
                are trying to achieve — a normal society in which democracy
                works, in which people may not like individual, elected
                representatives but at least have respect and regard for the
                institutions in which those representatives operate. The Civic
                Forum is clearly nestled in inclusiveness and involvement and in
                getting the community involved in democracy in Northern Ireland
                after 30 years of violence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Agnew noted that many references have been
                made to equality and rights in this debate. There are no such
                things as Unionist rights, Nationalist rights, orange rights or
                green rights. We want to see the rights accepted by democracy
                throughout the world accepted here. We all have rights and
                responsibilities and rules by which we should abide.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue of rules is relevant today; there
                has been a slight confusion with two words —
                &quot;organisation&quot; and &quot;sector&quot;. When referring
                to all sections of Northern Ireland, Mr Poots spoke of an
                Gaelaras as being an exclusive organisation with some right to
                be there. No organisation has a given right to be there. That
                was the rule agreed by the Assembly. Rather, sectors have the
                right. Mr Weir mentioned the trade union sector. He is correct:
                the trade union sector has a right to be a party to that
                process, but not ICTU or NIARC or any other trade union
                organisation. It is not an organisation but a sector which is
                represented, and people are nominated from that point of view.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another report came before the Assembly in
                February 1999, which again clarified where the nominations would
                come from. They were to come from 10 specified sectors, and not
                from individual organisations. The report also said that there
                would be a cultural traditions group and that within that group
                would be a four-member consortium. An advertisement was placed
                inviting organisations to apply to the consortium. I use the
                word &quot;organisation&quot; carefully; an organisation could
                be part of the consortium, but not individuals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After the Civic Forum secretariat received a
                letter from Mr Patton of the Orange Order, it advised him on 11
                August that members of the Order could apply. To date no
                applications have been received. The fact that there is a
                distinction between an organisation and a sector has permeated
                this debate. The Orange Order is seen as an organisation, not a
                sector; it is not eligible to apply.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The criteria used for selection were that on
                application had to come from an established Northern Ireland
                cultural organisation that had a proven background in community
                relations and showed an understanding of, and commitment to, the
                principles of equity, diversity and interdependence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the consortium was formed it decided on
                its selection system, and details of that were included in the
                report endorsed by the Assembly. My aim has been to distinguish
                between an organisation and a sector, the core of this argument.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Civic Forum is an element of the Belfast
                Agreement. It is to do with inclusiveness, not an easy issue. Mr
                Haughey and I have met with groups that feel they have been left
                out of the system. However, the general consensus is that the
                Forum is broadly representative. It may not be ideal, and it may
                not reflect what has been said by the proposers of the debate
                this afternoon. However, in difficult circumstances we have done
                our best to put appropriate representatives on it. As my party
                Colleague Dr Birnie, said this procedure will be reviewed within
                a year.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Junior Minister (Office of First and Deputy
                First Ministers) (Mr Haughey): </b>I want to refer to two
                general issues. Mr&nbsp;Poots and others have alleged that
                people who are not members of the Orange Order are ignorant of
                its nature, its beliefs and its function in the community.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Throughout this debate I detected a lack of
                appreciation of the nature of the Civic Forum and its function
                in this community as envisaged in the Good Friday Agreement. The
                purpose of the Forum is to enable this Administration to engage
                in a structured, formal dialogue with important sectors of the
                community in the social and economic sphere. Many Members missed
                that point.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not enough to assert that the Orange
                Order has a right to a special dedicated place in the Civic
                Forum. You have to provide a cogent and persuasive argument as
                to why, alone of all organisations — cultural, social,
                religious, sporting and so on — the Orange Order should have a
                dedicated place within the Civic Forum. That would not be an
                argument for a right, but rather for a privileged, different and
                unique position for the Orange Order. I am prepared to listen to
                such an argument, but I did not hear one.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If that argument were conceded, exactly the
                same argument could be made on behalf of the Royal Black
                Preceptory, the Apprentice Boys of Derry, the Royal Arch Purple
                and many other organisations on the Unionist side, let alone
                those on the Nationalist side. I am not going to mention names,
                because there is no exact parallel to the Orange Order on the
                Nationalist side of the community. However, there are many
                organisations on the Nationalist side that are as big, and as
                culturally significant, as the Orange Order is within the
                Unionist community. Would we have to examine which of those had
                a right to a dedicated place within the Civic Forum?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Minister Nesbitt pointed out, there was no
                ban on the Orange Order seeking a place within the Civic Forum.
                In fact, the Orange Order made early contact with the
                authorities, and was told in no uncertain terms how to go about
                seeking a place in the Civic Forum. It chose not to do so. That
                is its right, but a question mark, as well as an eyebrow, has to
                be raised if subsequent to the appointment of the Civic Forum it
                comes along and says it was ignored, left out, or discriminated
                against.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No one in the Administration, nor anyone in
                this House, would wish to discriminate against or deliberately
                or unfairly exclude the Orange Order. However, a pathway was
                there for it to seek entry into the Civic Forum, and it chose
                not to follow it. It has come along later and, with the support
                of those who proposed this motion, sought a privileged position,
                but without any persuasive argument as to why the Orange Order
                alone should have a dedicated place.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The confusion comes down to something Edwin
                Poots said. Some Members supporting the motion described the
                Orange Order as a religious organisation, others as a cultural
                organisation. Denis Watson described it as an organisation of
                enormous social significance in the Unionist community, and he
                referred to the community audits that have borne that out. Mr
                Poots then said it is all of those things — political,
                religious, social and cultural — and I do not doubt that he is
                right. However, if it is a political organisation, should it not
                have sought representation in this Chamber, which is the
                political centre of the Administration?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many of my Colleagues on the other side of
                the House are members of the Orange Order and can to one degree
                or another — I see Paul Berry smiling — speak for the Orange
                Order. This is the place for political argument. If the Orange
                Order is a religious organisation, is the place for religion not
                in church? Should it not have sought representation in the Civic
                Forum through the churches panel? If it is a cultural
                organisation, should it not have sought representation through
                the cultural panel? Why did it not do any of these things? No
                one has answered that question, and therefore I cannot
                understand why eyebrows are being raised and people are alleging
                discrimination.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to refer to some particular points
                made? Mr Dodds referred to the fact that the overwhelming
                majority of those in the Civic Forum are supporters of the
                agreement. I do not know how he is aware of that, but if it were
                so, I would not be surprised, given that 72% of the people of
                this community voted for the agreement. It would not be
                unreasonable to assume that the majority of those in the Civic
                Forum are from that 72% of the community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Weir confessed that he is an agnostic. I
                have no interest in his personal habits — <i>[Laughter]</i>
                — but as to his charge that the Forum is a quango, I suggest
                that he has got it wrong. I refer Members back to what I said at
                the beginning of the debate. The Forum is a structured body
                which is meant to communicate between civil society and
                Administration. The Administration is not going to limit itself
                to using the Civic Forum as the only means of engaging this
                community in dialogue, and I suggest that this is one of the
                ways in which this Administration can distinguish itself from
                what went before, in that we engage in honest, open dialogue
                with civil society, not just through the Civic Forum, but
                through many other channels.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Boyd alleged that the Orange Order had
                been excluded from the Civic Forum. In fact, it was not. The
                path that would have led to their having representation on it
                was open for them to take. Monica McWilliams, in a telling
                speech, pointed out that a position of privilege, not of right,
                was being sought for the Orange Order.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate my own Colleague Ms Hanna. She
                made a telling and constructive contribution to the debate in
                which she reiterated the confusion about the Orange Order and
                the fact that it did not seek a representative position through
                the normal channels but wished to take a privileged route into
                representation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to refer to a point that Mr Shannon
                made. He alleged that the composition of Civic Forum favoured
                Nationalists as opposed to Unionists by about two to one. That
                is not true, as the community background of the members of the
                Civic Forum is, in so far as they declare themselves, 55%
                Unionist and 45% Nationalist. That is roughly reflective of the
                balance in the wider community. Members ought to acquaint
                themselves with the nature and purpose of the forum and
                appreciate that it is not appropriate to seek a privileged
                position for one organisation above any other. If an
                organisation feels it has a contribution to make, it should try
                to get into the Civic Forum through the normal channels.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am grateful to all those who participated
                in the debate in a constructive way. However, to listen to Sinn
                Féin/IRA spokespersons talk about the bigotry and hatred of the
                Orange Order smacks of the utmost hypocrisy, when they have been
                guilty of the murder of Protestants, Unionists and members of
                the Orange Order, many of whom were going about their ordinary
                daily business and many of whom were attending their places of
                worship. It is nauseating to have to listen to people berating
                an organisation which is Christian in character and full of
                decent people. This organisation has been berated and denigrated
                by representatives of an organisation that has used murder,
                bombing, maiming, racketeering, and intimidation against
                innocent people — every foul and heinous crime in the book.
                The Sinn Féin/IRA contribution to this debate goes a long way
                towards explaining to the vast majority in the Province the
                reasons why they are unfit to be in the government of Northern
                Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They talked about the Orange Order’s having
                no contribution to make to the Civic Forum. Of course, someone
                who attempted to murder an RUC officer — and only failed to do
                so because his gun jammed — does have something to contribute
                to the Civic Forum. However, the largest Protestant organisation
                in this country has nothing to contribute, according to Sinn
                Féin/IRA. As my Colleague, Mr Watson from Upper Bann noted, the
                Prime Minister has been in contact with representatives of the
                Order today, pointing out the valuable role that that
                organisation plays in civic society. This is a Prime Minister
                who is so often relied on and quoted by the pro-agreement
                parties represented here. However, his evaluation of the Orange
                Order is dismissed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I flagged up in advance many of the points
                that I expected to be raised during the debate, but that did not
                stop Members of the Opposition from making them. However, given
                the way in which most of their speeches were delivered, I
                suspect they did not listen to a number of points that we
                raised, preferring, as they did, to read prepared scripts. Why
                let a few facts get in the way of your pre-prepared speech,
                written by a scriptwriter and hand-delivered to you?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In reality — <i>[Interruption]</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We always let the facts speak for themselves,
                and a number of facts stand out. I would be grateful for
                silence, and some good manners, from the hecklers in the
                opposite corner. I hope, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you will be
                assiduous in treating equally all parties in the House. We
                listened with great courtesy to most of what has been said, even
                when Members attacked the Orange Order and the DUP on these
                issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the outset Mr Weir said he suspected that
                there would be no Ulster Unionist Members speaking, apart from
                himself. As it turned out, Dr Birnie rose to the challenge and
                made a small contribution, but he was the only Member from the
                Ulster Unionist ranks to do so. I am disappointed that Mr
                Trimble, who made these appointments, along with Mr Mallon, has
                failed to show up in the Chamber to listen to the criticisms and
                some of the points that have been made. Under the legislation
                the nominations are made by them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie talked about the coherence of the
                motion, and said that no action could be taken. On the contrary,
                the Deputy First Minister said in his speech on 25 September
                2000 that if it was found that the Civic Forum did not include a
                wide range of opinions and views, swift action would be taken to
                remedy that. I ask the First Minister and the Deputy First
                Minister to do something, given the outcry and the concerns that
                have been expressed about the non-representation of the Grand
                Lodge. In the light of what has been said since the nominations,
                I take him up on his offer and challenge him — a challenge to
                which the junior Ministers did not respond — to review this
                and review it quickly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Haughey said that the Civic Forum is not a
                quango. It is very much a quango — it is unelected, and it
                exists to duplicate what the Assembly Committees will be doing,
                if its members do their job correctly. I do not accept what the
                junior Minister said about quangos.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has been repeated many times by Members,
                and by the Minister, that the Orange Order did not apply for
                membership of the Civic Forum. That is not the case at all. If
                they had listened to what was said by Mr Watson and me — and
                Mr Watson is in a position to know this — they would have
                taken that on board, instead of repeating what is clearly not
                the case.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The method by which nominations and
                appointments were to be made was set out on 16 February 1999. We
                voted against them at the time and anticipated some of the
                inevitable problems, and we have been vindicated. The Orange
                Order realised that and made contact with the Office of the
                First Minister and the Deputy First Minister. It was advised
                about what it should do and it followed that advice. As Mr
                Watson has already explained, two members of the Grand Orange of
                Ireland did apply for membership of the Civic Forum.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those applications were unsuccessful, but it
                remained open to the First Minister and the Deputy First
                Minister, when it came to their nominations, to appoint a
                representative of an organisation that had not been included, in
                the same way that they decided to appoint a representative of a
                political party that had failed to get selected on any other
                criterion.</p>

                speak. I am winding up and want to deal with as many points as I
                can.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That member of a political party was
                specifically appointed, according to the First Minister, to
                ensure that balance and inclusion did occur. In the light of the
                nominations that came forward through the selection process, the
                First Minister saw his job as ensuring that balance and
                inclusion occurred. He took the step of including the leader of
                a political party that had not been selected. What did he do to
                the Grand Lodge of Ireland? He chose not to include a
                representative of that, but to include another member of the
                Orange Order. That person has his own abilities and talents. I
                cast no aspersions on him personally, but he is not a
                representative of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland, and the
                Grand Orange would not have put him forward. That is the point.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister and the Deputy First
                Minister had the opportunity, in their nominations, to do what
                they said the purpose of their nominations was — to ensure
                that balance and inclusion did occur. They used that argument to
                justify the appointment of the leader of a party that had not
                been selected under the normal selection process. They chose not
                to do that when it came to a representative of the Grand Orange
                Lodge of Ireland. It is clear — and there can be no excuse for
                this — that a deliberate decision was taken that no
                representative of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland would be
                included.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One has to ask why that should be. Perhaps
                someone in the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First
                Minister shared Mr Ervine’s views on the anti-agreement stance
                of the Orange Order. Other people represented on the Civic Forum
                of people have, in the past, espoused violence and murder as a
                means of achieving their ends. When there was an opportunity for
                Mr Trimble and Mr Mallon to practice inclusive democracy, as
                opposed to just talking about it, their actions fell well short
                of their words. All the attempts of the SDLP and others to
                justify it simply do not hold water. There is no balance, as Mr
                Watson has said, if the epitome of Protestant culture and
                heritage is missing. A number of Members, including Mr Hilditch,
                pointed out that if the First Minister is trying to break the
                link between his party and the Orange Order, it is no great
                surprise that he should be taking such a vindictive attitude
                towards the Grand Lodge.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is an opportunity to right this wrong.
                Mr Haughey said that I had said that a majority of Civic Forum
                appointees were pro-agreement. If he checks the record he will
                find that what I said was that the Civic Forum was, with a few
                honourable exceptions, made up entirely of pro-agreement failed
                politicians and ex-terrorists. There is very little room for an
                anti-agreement point of view. If he checks the record and the
                list of appointments, he will find that that is the case. Where
                is the inclusive democracy there?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We then face the red herring argument that
                because we opposed the creation of the Civic Forum we are not
                entitled to talk about the composition of it. We are perfectly
                entitled to do that, and we said so on 16 February 1999 in this
                House when there was a debate on the means by which the Civic
                Forum would be composed and nominated. That is why we took part
                in that debate. We took the opportunity then; we did not come
                along later and criticise. We voted against it at that point,
                along with Colleagues who pointed out some of the problems that
                were going to arise, not least that no criteria were set down by
                the First Minister and Deputy First Minister on how they would
                use their appointments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remember that some of the other parties
                that were in favour of the Civic Forum said in principle that
                this was an agreeable mission. There was no indication from Mr
                Trimble or Mr&nbsp;Mallon on how they would use those
                appointments. The reality, as we can now see, is that Mr Mallon
                used one of his appointments to select someone who does not live
                or work in Northern Ireland. Mr Trimble appointed someone who
                could not get elected and someone who he thought was a better
                representative for Orange issues than the Grand Orange Lodge of
                Ireland. If these principles were applied when approaching
                community organisations, voluntary organisations and others, and
                if those sectors were not allowed to appoint their own
                representatives, how should that be viewed?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many Members have spoken eloquently and
                passionately about the Orange Order, about its role in civic
                society, about the work the Order has done over the years, about
                the loyalty it evokes among tens of thousands of people in
                Northern Ireland and about the grave injustice that is being
                done by not having a voice from the Orange Institution — and
                from Grand Lodge in particular — on the Civic Forum. Today the
                Prime Minister, Tony Blair, wrote to representatives of the
                Grand Lodge to praise its role in society. It is remarkable
                that, on the same day, representatives of the First Minister and
                the Deputy First Minister have come to the House to reinforce
                the snub to the Orange Order, which has already been delivered.</p>

                ours, or those with Parliaments similar to our own. That is one
                reason why I am making this proposal. Ours is a new Assembly and
                I have often found that, rather than constantly looking inward,
                it is extremely important and useful for us to look outward.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the invitation of the CPA, I attended a
                recent meeting involving all member countries — those that are
                in the Commonwealth and those that are not. Members need to know
                that it is possible to attend such meetings as an observer. The
                meeting, which was about the role of women in public life, was
                one of the most useful that I have ever attended. I met women
                Ministers from India, South Africa, Canada, Australia and many
                of the smaller countries.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Currently, 142 national, state, provincial
                and territorial Parliaments are members of the Commonwealth
                Parliamentary Association. Our Assembly would benefit from
                membership. Member states said that, against all the obstacles,
                they too have found innovative and imaginative ways of
                introducing policies, getting resources and producing
                legislation on issues that are culturally sensitive in their
                countries and that challenge and confront the old, traditional
                ways of doing things. That says a great deal for those who work
                in a country such as India. Having learned from that experience
                and having spent time with those working in other Parliaments, I
                feel that we are missing out by not being part of the
                Commonwealth Parliamentary Association.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It should also be noted that the CPA is a
                charitable organisation, and its constitution states that,
                should it ever be wound up, its funds would go to charity. Lest
                there be any misapprehension that the CPA is a mysterious
                organisation that has been increasingly trying to get people to
                join the Commonwealth by the back door, I must say that that is
                not the case. The association involves countries that are part
                of the Commonwealth, including the new nations — in
                particular, the provinces of South&nbsp;Africa and of India —
                as well as observers. However, I must propose that we become a
                full member and pay our membership accordingly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Currently, 14,000 Members of different
                Parliaments throughout the world are part of the Commonwealth
                Parliamentary Association. Over the past 10 years more than
                30&nbsp;new Parliaments and other legislatures have joined. Only
                legislative bodies are entitled to do so. As the Assembly is a
                devolved legislature, it is entitled to become a full member. It
                is important for those of us who are concerned that military
                dictatorships should not be in the association to note that
                Pakistan is no longer a member. Following the 1999 coup that
                country is no longer a parliamentary democracy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We would also benefit greatly from discussing
                global political issues, such as the situation in Cyprus. The
                association also has networks and databases. Speaking from my
                own interest, I would tell Members that the association has a
                worldwide database of women parliamentarians. As we are so few
                — not just in this Assembly, where we are only 14, but in
                other Assemblies — we would benefit greatly, in terms of both
                procedures and how we connect with minorities elsewhere, were we
                enabled to join our colleagues, in this case our sisters, from
                other Parliaments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">South Africa went through its conflict and
                emerged from it. In the initial stages of establishing the
                national Parliament and the provincial Assemblies, 200 South
                Africans — new Members of Parliament — were trained by the
                Commonwealth Parliamentary Association in parliamentary
                procedures. No doubt that was of great assistance to them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">South Africa’s is a young Parliament; ours
                is a very young Assembly. Being able to connect with the new
                Parliament and provincial Assemblies of South Africa would allow
                us to examine our own procedures and see whether they fit this
                Assembly. We have said that we will not follow Westminster just
                because it has an old, established way of doing things. We can
                borrow good practice from elsewhere.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you do not know about those examples of
                good practice, you cannot borrow them, and this network of
                legislatures would enable an exchange of ideas and information.</p>

                membership of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association (CPA)
                would add a further dimension to the growing status of the
                Assembly. The preamble to the constitution of the CPA
                establishes that it was set up by</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Commonwealth parliamentarians who,
                irrespective of gender, race, religion or culture, being united
                by community of interest, respect for the rule of law and
                individual rights and freedoms, and by pursuit of the positive
                ideals of parliamentary democracy&quot; .</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We in this Assembly should aspire to
                membership of an organisation that promotes such noble,
                pluralist ideals. Some Members among us may oppose the motion
                through some twisted and unshakeable anti-British and
                anti-Commonwealth prejudice. I challenge any Member to read that
                preamble and tell me how it fits in with the myth of being
                beaten into the clay through seven heroic centuries. The fact is
                that the CPA is a community of legislatures, committed to
                furthering democratic ideals in the modern era.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regrettably, there are those in the Assembly
                who themselves do not live up to those democratic ideals. We
                might be right to wonder whether we are asking a lot of the CPA
                to accommodate an Assembly which, while itself democratically
                elected and committed to the delivery of accountable democracy,
                has within it Ministers whose commitment to non-violence and
                exclusively peaceful and democratic means is, at best,
                questionable. However, I do not think that the rest of us, who
                are committed unquestionably to democracy, should have our place
                in the international community undermined by those who are in
                default on their Pledge of Office.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We may be permitted to hope that our
                corporate subscription to the democratic principles of the CPA
                will contribute to dragging those who still have difficulties
                with democracy into the twenty-first century. I still believe
                that the best way to persuade people of the benefits of
                democracy is to expose them to it at every opportunity. We must
                not miss the opportunity to rejoin the CPA.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Not for the first time we find ourselves
                lagging behind Scotland and Wales, where branches have already
                been established. For them, of course, it is first-time
                membership; for us, it would be re-establishment. Northern
                Ireland first joined the then Empire Parliamentary Association
                in 1924. We remained active members until our membership was set
                in abeyance in 1973. A brief re-establishment in 1974 was
                followed by our membership’s again being put in abeyance in
                1975. We have remained in that position ever since.</p>

                parliament at Westminster. I make no apology for supporting the
                motion, because membership of the CPA fits my Ulster Unionist
                belief in pluralism, democracy and the rule of law. I commend
                the Women’s Coalition for raising this matter. If other
                parties oppose this forward looking initiative, this opportunity
                to bring us into an organisation that accommodates far-flung
                legislatures in Canada, Mozambique, Jamaica and India, those
                parties must ask themselves where they stand in the modern
                world.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I look forward to this Assembly having its
                membership of the CPA confirmed. I hope that we will still be
                here in 2011 to join in the centenary celebrations of the
                Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. I support the motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wells:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The DUP gives this motion its full support.
                We believe that Northern Ireland is already part of the
                Commonwealth by virtue of its status as an integral part of the
                United Kingdom. Our athletes participate in the Commonwealth
                Games, and we believe that it would be a tremendous benefit for
                the Assembly to join this association.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Commonwealth Parliamentary Association
                has a tremendous breadth of interest and experiences ranging
                from India — the largest democracy in the world — to many
                small Caribbean islands that have only recently adopted
                democracy. There is much that we can learn and things that
                others can learn from us. I believe that nothing but good can
                come from this. Our colleagues in Scotland and Wales have
                joined, and, in the interests of parity, we should follow that
                lead and join also.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps one thing we can teach our colleagues
                in other Commonwealth countries is that any form of democracy
                which is sold on the basis of a Prime Minister’s lies and of
                promises made but not kept, and which enables terrorists to be
                allowed into government without the decommissioning of their
                weapons, is doomed to failure. If other small democracies, on an
                off day, think that they might go down the road that Northern
                Ireland adopted under the so-called Good Friday Agreement,
                perhaps we could tell them to think of the consequences and look
                at what happened to us. We could suggest to them that they adopt
                a structure that is based on genuine non-violence and real
                democracy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But apart from that I think that we can
                learn. We have had the privilege of welcoming many of these
                parliamentary groups to the Assembly. I, for some reason, seem
                to be picked by my party to meet many of these groups, and it
                has been a privilege to do so. I have met representatives from
                Canada, Australia, and Zimbabwe — or Rhodesia, as it used to
                be called — and have had useful exchange of views with these
                parliamentarians.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hear that there might be Members who are
                thinking of opposing this motion. What is their motivation? What
                can they possibly lose by supporting the motion?</p>

                they something to fear from meeting these people and learning
                from them? Or is it just that their party political dogma is
                that anything remotely attaching itself to the British link is

                It is interesting that Mr Wells related what he anticipated to
                be our attitude to this motion. His party refuses to go into the
                Executive with people elected to this Assembly, and it refuses
                to participate in any North/South business with its nearest
                neighbour on the other side of the border, yet Mr Wells accuses
                Sinn Féin of racism and anticipates that we will not engage
                with a wide range of people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It will not surprise anyone in the Assembly
                to hear that we, as Irish Republicans, have difficulty and deep
                concerns about this motion. That is not from a desire to deny
                networking opportunities but from the fact that the legacy of
                the British Commonwealth has negative connotations, particularly
                for people of a Nationalist and Republican persuasion in
                Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We do not want to frustrate opportunities for
                networking, and we believe that many opportunities for
                networking among parliaments already exist. They are not limited
                in any shape or fashion to the four parties that make up the
                Executive in this Assembly. We would prefer for the Assembly to
                deal, in the first instance, with some of the parliamentary
                links that were envisaged under the Good Friday Agreement, such
                as an interparliamentary organisation between ourselves and the
                Dáil, which has yet to be fully realised. We would prefer to
                get these relationships in order before considering other formal
                relationships or joining any other parliamentary organisations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Anybody from the Commonwealth Parliamentary
                Association listening to the two Unionist Members might not be
                waiting with bated breath to see whether we enter into this.
                Their attitude appears to be &quot;We will go along and join
                this, but we apologise for some of the people that we are
                bringing with us.&quot; David&nbsp;McClarty’s attitude is very
                condescending. Talk about people and their democratic
                credentials: his party brought us one-party rule for
                50&nbsp;years, introduced gerrymandering to this part of Ireland
                for so many years and disenfranchised a large section of the
                population represented by this side of the Chamber. His is a
                condescending attitude that we reject entirely. We are here on
                our democratic credentials and it is time that Mr&nbsp;McClarty
                and his party recognised that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we establish a formal and proper
                relationship with our neighbouring island — and that is my
                aspiration as an Irish republican — we can examine the
                relationships we have with certain parliamentary organisations
                that take their existence from the British Commonwealth. Until
                such times as we establish proper relationships on our own
                island and with our neighbouring island, Sinn&nbsp;Féin, as
                Republicans, will not be supporting this motion.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is unfortunate that a motion introduced in
                an attempt to be uncontentious has created such difficulties
                across the Chamber. I share most of the concerns expressed by
                most Members about what other people have said or are about to
                say.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend Monica&nbsp;McWilliams and
                Jane&nbsp;Morrice for bringing the motion forward. To have such
                a petty bicker about an issue like this shows how much this
                Assembly needs to broaden its contacts in the wider world. Those
                of us who had the pleasure of meeting members of the Quebec
                National Assembly benefited from learning something from their
                experiences. Some were of relevance to us and some not. It was
                an indication of how we can benefit from those wider links.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Commonwealth is not the only link that we
                should be looking to. Conor&nbsp;Murphy referred to parts of the
                Good Friday Agreement that clearly specified that there should
                be a link between the Assembly and the Oireachtas and that there
                would be an encouragement to links between the elected
                institutions represented in the British/Irish Council. If I have
                a problem with this motion, it is that it has come forward at
                this stage without any reference to those other links that it
                would have been useful to explore at the same time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have obligations under the Agreement that,
                as the First&nbsp;Minister told me a few weeks ago, are not the
                Executive’s business but the business of this Chamber. I will
                see that the Business Committee follows that up. I hope that the
                Executive, which is the only body currently involved in the
                British/Irish Council, will encourage links with other bodies,
                particularly the other devolved institutions in Scotland and
                Wales and the other institutions represented in the
                British/Irish Council. That is for the future. At present, we
                must face this motion, and I urge the House to support it in the
                terms in which it was proposed by Monica&nbsp;McWilliams, if not
                necessarily in the terms in which others supported it.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion, but I am confused and
                imagine that when the Women’s Coalition arrive home this
                evening to have their evening meal with their partners, they
                might begin to understand the close relationship between the
                word &quot;commendation&quot; and the word
                &quot;condemnation&quot;. I am not sure which one they would
                feel to be more beneficial coming from certain parts of this
                Chamber.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a valuable contribution on the day
                that we launch our Programme for Government. While there may be
                difficulties with that, it embraces the suggestion that an
                outward-looking Northern Ireland will be a more prosperous
                country. It will be a Northern Ireland that can learn and teach,
                and the first thing it might learn is that if Zimbabweans came
                here, there had to be terrorists in their Government — unless,
                of course, they were Rhodesians who behaved like terrorists
                before the terrorists who were the Zimbabweans became the
                Government. You know what I mean. You might talk about Jomo&nbsp;Kenyatta
                or Archbishop&nbsp;Makarios.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many other arenas of past conflict against my
                Government have now developed into warm, reasonable and sensible
                relationships, irrespective of whether they began as terrorists
                in government. The recognition of the need to explore and
                explain and the importance of networking ensure that not only
                are benefits gained but a two-way street can be offered. That
                could mean the African nations, or Malaysia, or perhaps — and
                I say this not in any sense of hurt or attempt to inflict hurt
                — the Irish Government, which may, through Dáil Éireann,
                believe that this is a worthy body to join.</p>

                how it might fit with the rest of the world. I commend the Women’s

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have two comments on the debate so far. The
                contribution of Conor Murphy, despite how some might portray it,
                was quite thoughtful. His argument was that this is not an issue
                about membership of this association. It is more an issue of
                timing than of principle, and, while he might not concur with
                that characterisation of his comments, I think that it is
                accurate.</p>
                <b>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the hon Member think for one moment that
                if we had the links that Mr Murphy was requesting with the Irish
                Parliament and then proposed that we join the Commonwealth
                Parliament Association, he would be on his feet saying
                &quot;Hear, hear. I agree with that.&quot;? Does he honestly
                think that that would happen?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Attwood:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wells should never underestimate the
                ability of people to change their attitudes. Many people in this
                Chamber have radically transformed their attitudes, and will
                change them in the future — including myself and perhaps, one
                day, Mr Wells. There is a maturity emerging in political
                society, or at least in elements of political society in the
                North.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the Good Friday Agreement states that
                there shall be equality and parity of esteem, sometimes it means
                accepting what other people value even if you do not value it
                yourself.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The SDLP is bringing that perspective to this
                debate. We as a community do not have any natural identification
                with the concept or the institutions of commonwealth, but we
                know that there are people in this Chamber and in our community
                who value that concept and that practice. We will be supporting
                this motion, primarily because of that principle and because we
                honour the Good Friday Agreement when it refers to fair
                treatment and equality. It is a matter of our respect for other
                traditions and communities and for what they say and value. In
                this instance, its manifestation is the Commonwealth
                Association. For that reason we will be accepting this motion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We do say, however — and this has been
                hinted at elsewhere — that this issue and the wider
                relationships between this Parliament and other Parliaments
                should have been addressed in a wider context, including that of
                the relationship between the Dáil and the Assembly, as possibly
                envisaged in the Good Friday Agreement. As Monica McWilliams
                pointed out, there is value and purpose in relationships with
                other parliamentary associations and Parliaments around the
                world, inside and outside the Commonwealth. That should have
                been the context of this debate, and in that context perhaps
                Sinn Féin — perhaps all of us — could have signed up to
                associations or relationships with other parliamentary
                associations, not just with that of the Commonwealth
                Association.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Jim Wells is quite right. People in the North
                have something to share with the rest of the world — not
                necessarily the issues of &quot;terrorists in government&quot;,
                inclusive government and weapons. Where we have most to share
                with other societies is what the UN High Commissioner for Human
                Rights said in Belfast in December two years ago: the world is
                most interested in the Good Friday Agreement because of its
                issues of rights. What they understand best are the rights
                provisions of the Good Friday Agreement. The greatest concern is
                rights, not who is in government or what happens to weapons. It
                is the issue of rights. Membership of the association may enable
                us to share with it our experience of rights and the denial and
                future protection of rights.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will not deny for one minute that in our
                community the concept of Commonwealth has in the past had
                unhappy images of exploitation, empire and economic
                expansionism.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is therefore difficult for our community
                fully to understand what the Unionists value and to identify
                with that. However, we want to show respect, now and in the
                future, for a principle that will be espoused throughout the
                Chamber in coming weeks. We will accept the motion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the Unionists Members are arguing for
                membership of the interparliamentary association then hopefully
                this weekend they will not argue for withdrawal from
                interjurisdictional associations in the country.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have learned one thing in the course of
                this debate. Following Mr Wells’s hint that he is the
                acceptable face of the DUP, I would like to second my Colleague
                Mr David McClarty in strongly supporting the motion. We commend
                Ms McWilliams for bringing the motion to the House. The
                Commonwealth Parliamentary Association has a number of fine
                aspirations: the rule of law; individual rights and
                parliamentary democracy. Membership of the Association has not
                always resulted in perfect adherence to such principles, but
                over time the Commonwealth has acted as a mechanism to encourage
                countries to move in the right direction.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Referring back to Mr Ervine’s comments, I
                think that given the conditions that we experience in the
                Assembly and in the Province, we might learn from the experience
                of other countries where parties and politicians have
                successfully made a transition from paramilitarism to
                non-violence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The case for this motion is that we are
                talking about restoring a link that existed in the past. We had
                a branch membership in the old Stormont Parliament from 1924 to
                1975. It is possible to meet two main objections which have been
                raised. First, there is no incompatibility between support for
                the motion and the idea that, when the time is right and
                circumstances allow, there should be interparliamentary links
                between, for example, the Assembly and the Dáil or between the
                various devolved and national-level Governments within the
                British Isles.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second objection seems to be that the
                Commonwealth Parliamentary Association is contaminated by
                historical association with the rights or, as some would see it,
                the wrongs of the record of the British Empire. There is an
                answer to that. Mozambique has joined the Commonwealth and is
                now represented in the Parliamentary Association. Mozambique was
                never a member of the British empire; it was a Portuguese
                colony. Let me point out, for those who feel sensitive about the
                subject, that there is no connection with British imperialism. I
                reiterate that the Ulster Unionist Party fully supports this
                timely motion.</p>

                This motion is very appropriate, especially given that this is
                Environment Week. As political leaders and activists, many in
                the Assembly have worked closely with local communities on
                environmental and planning issues. They have been lobbied on a
                diverse range of environmental projects, such as protecting the
                Black Mountain and Cavehill overlooking Belfast, the
                consequences of fly dumping and the raising of public awareness
                about the environmental impacts of gold mining in Tyrone, and
                lignite mining around Lough Neagh. Some of us have been asked to
                support campaigns against the construction of incinerators. Two
                main lessons have been learned. First, collective action by
                communities, which gained support from the general public, can
                achieve real and positive change and solve environmental
                problems. This also leads to an overall heightening of public
                awareness of the importance of environmental issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second lesson that we have learned is
                that environmental problems are not only a local or national
                concern, they can have global implications too. Public concern
                is widespread about issues such as ozone depletion; the
                greenhouse effect; legal and illegal emissions from nuclear
                installations; the commercial harvesting of biogenetic
                engineering crops; and the destruction of the rain forest.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How do you solve these problems? Where do you
                start looking? A local Assembly, even one with strictly limited
                devolved authority, is the obvious place to seek redress on
                these important matters.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Simply stated, the problem is that we as a
                society of producers and consumers are producing too much waste.
                The EU Commission distinguished between different types of
                waste, and it defined 27 categories of waste under EU Directive
                78/319/EEC. The main category is solid waste, which is domestic
                waste, industrial and commercial waste, and litter and waste
                from mining, quarries, constructions and agriculture, including
                sludge and semi-sludge, that cannot be discharged into water and
                air.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are also definitions for toxic and
                dangerous waste, as well as what the EU defines as priority
                waste. These include used tyres; end-of-life vehicles;
                construction, demolition and packaging waste; and waste from
                electrical equipment, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and
                solvents. There is a landfill crisis, and we are needlessly
                producing waste. Many of the industries whose goods we consume
                and export are producing dangerous toxic waste, which is
                polluting the air we breathe, our rivers, our water supplies and
                our seas. The solutions which they use for containing waste are
                failing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The most common method of dealing with waste
                is to dig a hole and bury it. As late as 1980 it was assumed
                that we could solve the problem by digging increasingly bigger
                holes to contain the waste. This method is better known as
                &quot;landfill&quot;, and it is no longer practical or accepted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are two significant problems with the
                use of landfill sites. First, many landfill sites are sources of
                pollution in themselves. Pollutants from the waste stored in
                these sites are leached into the water system of surrounding
                areas, causing damage to the local environment. Current EU
                regulations reflect the grave danger to the atmosphere posed by
                methane, a potent greenhouse gas. The second pressing problem is
                that available sites are running out.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Throughout Ireland, local government bodies
                are responsible for the maintenance of landfill sites, so they
                are simply established in those areas where there is least
                public resistance. The environmental sustainability of such
                sites has come a very poor second to local authorities’ need
                to find sites.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is clear that waste is — to quote Mary
                Douglas — &quot;matter in the wrong place&quot;. The next
                obvious question is whether a means of redirecting this matter
                into the right place is needed. If waste paper, glass and metal
                make up the bulk of most municipal waste streams, they could be
                recovered to take the place of primary materials, creating the
                environmental and financial benefits of a secondary material
                industry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The island of Ireland is establishing itself
                as a leading player in the new economics of information and
                communications-led technology. Few economic sectors will be left
                untouched by the knowledge-led revolution. Local communities
                celebrate their commitments to knowledge-based industries, and
                political leaders rush to champion their towns and cities as the
                new &quot;Silicon Valley&quot;. Unfortunately the waste
                management sector has proved resilient to the influence of a
                smart Government and new technologies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unless we address the gap that persists
                between the rapid development in smart technology and the new
                economics of resource efficiency, Ireland’s &quot;Silicon
                Valley&quot; will inherit a waste management infrastructure
                which was originally designed for the nineteenth century.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over the coming decades our society will have
                to adapt. Zero waste represents a new planning approach and
                defines the discipline required to create a more viable pattern
                of interactions with our natural world, including the principles
                of conserving resources, minimising pollution, maximising
                employment opportunities, and providing the greatest degree of
                local economic self-reliance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The following guiding principle on zero waste
                must be translated into practical policies and measures:
                responsibility for waste management must pass from the taxpayer
                and local authorities to the manufacturers and producers of
                goods who can ensure that the design of their product and
                packaging includes plans for the recovery of the material. Local
                authority engineers and other officers must be retrained to
                depart progressively from landfill and incinerator approaches to
                waste disposal and to adopt a modernised procedure. These
                techniques aim to create enabling frameworks for producers and
                consumers to increase the resource productivity and reduce
                hazards through the design of products and processes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Manufacturers could close the loop by using
                materials collected through recycling programmes to produce
                their new products and packaging. There could be initiatives to
                encourage households and businesses to reduce waste and to
                recycle and a scheme could be introduced to bring about changes
                in waste disposal and material recovery.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These changes would involve phasing out
                existing disposal methods — landfill and incinerators — and
                waste which produces pollution in our air, on our land and in
                our sea. The true long-term environmental impact and health
                implications of such methods of disposal should be taken into
                account and must eventually lead to the withdrawal of publicly
                funded subsidies such as the EC Non-Fossil Fuel obligation. In
                that context, I wish to welcome the recent comments of Steven
                Byers, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. He has
                announced that the British Government intend to exclude energy
                from waste facilities for such incentive schemes and instead to
                focus resources on genuine sources of renewable energy. This
                announcement should send a warning about financial uncertainties
                surrounding incinerator technology, uncertainties which do not
                feature in the consultation report from local authorities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We propose investing in a new jobs sector for
                waste recycling. The potential for job creation in this area is
                promising, especially when we factor in the opportunity for
                creating local enterprise.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The development of a new market for these
                services is a powerful response to Ireland’s wasteful status
                quo. Markets are a function of political and cultural preference
                and often require regulation and incentive structures to
                establish the viability of desirable technology and design. An
                all-Ireland inland scheme of incentives for the development of
                this market is required to support a zero waste strategy. The
                economic playing field must be levelled. Sustainable development
                is on the lips of policy makers at all levels, but it is all too
                easy to adopt an abstract commitment which is somewhat removed
                from today’s concrete decisions. Waste management and material
                recovery strategies will be a litmus test of the extent to which
                policy makers have internalised the rationale and regulations of
                sustainability and agreed disclosure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask the House to support the motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I beg to move the following amendment: Leave
                out all the words after &quot;to&quot; in line 1 and add</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;set a target of 50% of domestic and
                non-domestic waste to be recycled or composted within 10 years,
                with further progressive reductions in line with best economic
                and environmental practice in other European regions.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This Assembly further calls upon the Minister
                of the Environment to initiate joint actions with his southern
                counterpart towards this end.&quot;</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At first the motion seemed attractive in
                principle. It deals with an area which we need to take seriously
                and in which we have not performed very well in the recent past.
                However, when I read its wording I came to the conclusion, and
                my Colleagues agreed with me, that the detail was suffering a
                little from &quot;Dallat syndrome&quot;. My political handbook
                for 2000-01 defines this as a motion which is fairly good in
                principle but whose words do not quite add up as they were meant
                to in practice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is probably the first time I have ever
                stood up in the Chamber and accused Sinn Féin of being too
                idealistic for this world, but I fear that with this motion,
                that is indeed the case. There is no doubt that the party has
                dark green credentials in one aspect of our political life, but
                I fear that the dark green credentials in this motion go even
                further than those of most of the environmental groups who lobby
                us on matters like this.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In September I asked the Minister of the
                Environment about recycling targets. The response, which I
                received last week, referred to the Department of the
                Environment’s setting a target of 15% of waste to be recycled
                by the year 2005.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a measure of how poorly we were
                governed under direct rule that measures that went through in
                England, Wales and Scotland were not carried forward into
                legislation in Northern Ireland and Ministers made no effort to
                encourage such targeting.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At least the new Minister has established
                that much, and the waste management strategy that resulted from
                his efforts and Mr Howarth’s during the suspension of
                devolution means that we are, starting to move forward. There is
                no doubt that the current talk of 15% in five years’ time is
                well below the targets that have been set for councils across
                the water, and it is inadequate for our needs. It is also
                significantly below the best practice that is being achieved
                elsewhere.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Great Britain a number of councils are
                close to achieving the 50% referred to in the amendment, not in
                10 years’ time, but in the next year or so. I have figures
                showing that Eastleigh in Hampshire has already exceeded 42% and
                that the London borough of Sutton expects to achieve 50%
                recycling by the end of this financial year. Our 50% is fits in
                with that best practice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Across the water the Department of the
                Environment, Transport and the Regions, having gone through one
                set of criteria for recycling, has now removed waste composting
                from its targets. This comes at a time when it is acknowledged
                that putrescent waste going into a landfill is the major cause
                of methane pollution and leachate run-off.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the Minister responds to this debate I
                hope he can give us an assurance that he is not going to follow
                the route of the Department of the Environment, Transport and
                the Regions and that he will set better targets for Northern
                Ireland. No doubt his experience as a councillor will enable him
                to follow through the implications of that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the problems in Northern Ireland is
                that over the last decade or so, councils district gave every
                household a large wheelie bin. Nothing encourages large amounts
                of waste to be thrown out more than doubling the size of a bin.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Speaking as a member of one of the best local
                authorities in this respect (Antrim), I can say that even there
                we have — <i>[Interruption] </i>Calm yourselves. Even there a
                black bin containing up to 240 litres of rubbish is collected
                every week, and a blue bin containing up to 120 litres of paper,
                plastic and aluminium is collected every four weeks. We need to
                do something to redress the balance if we are ever to stop
                putting vast amounts of waste into landfill and get real
                recycling underway.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The authorities that have achieved most in
                England and Wales have introduced two equal-sized bins with
                alternate week collection — one week for the recyclables, and
                one week for the landfill. We could make significant advances in
                this way. One council has claimed a 30% increase in its
                recycling in less than three years by the introducing that
                scheme combined with the provision of green composting bins to
                reduce the amount of putrescent waste that goes into the bins,
                thereby getting major benefits for its landfill management.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Northern Ireland three groups of councils
                have started to build on the Department’s waste management
                strategy. Whatever the DUP may think, this is not just a
                Northern Ireland issue. As I understand it, Donegal County
                Council is part of the north-west consortium along with Strabane
                District Council, Derry City Council and others. We should look
                for the appropriate level of cross-border supervision, support
                and co-operation — although I would not wish to see Northern
                Ireland becoming the dumping ground for the entire island, which
                might be inferred from an all-island as opposed to a
                cross-border strategy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The 50% target set out in the amendment is
                realistic in the sense that it is optimistic and attainable.
                There is no point in having a target that we could not reach,
                and no point in having one that is reached too easily.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The zero waste target set out in the original
                motion would create difficulties. The only way we could possibly
                achieve a zero waste target would be by incineration.
                Incinerators will eat the greater part of the waste stream,
                whether or not parts of it would be better diverted for reuse or
                recycling in other areas. What comes out of an incinerator has
                to be used in some way. A zero waste target is unrealistic given
                our current level of knowledge. The amendment speaks of a target
                of 50% with further progressive reductions, a realistic option
                which is in line with best practice elsewhere in Europe. I urge
                the Assembly to accept it.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Carson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall oppose the motion and the amendment.
                I am not against the goal of waste reduction with a sustainable
                development focus. Nor am I against North/South co-operation on
                the issue of waste reduction, which is encouraged by EC
                directives. East/West co-operation within the United Kingdom is
                also needed to ensure that we achieve parity with UK
                legislation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion calling on the Minister of the
                Environment to agree a waste-management strategy to achieve a
                zero level of waste within a generation sets a target which is
                unachievable under present conditions, unless we re-educate
                society. The amendment merely compounds the problem without
                seriously addressing the question of re-education of the public.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The aspiration of zero waste is admirable,
                but if zero waste management is pursued as suggested in the
                motion, the process will contradict the four main principles in
                ‘A Better Quality of Life: A Strategy for Waste Management in
                the United Kingdom’, published in May 1999 by the United
                Kingdom Government. The four principles are: all-encompassing
                social needs; effective protection of the environment; prudent
                use of natural resources; and the maintenance of high and stable
                levels of economic growth and employment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The cost of implementing zero waste
                management would be monumental and would not allow for
                sustainable development. Waste reduction involves not only the
                destruction of rubbish, but also transport, sustainable
                development, industry, agriculture, energy and so on. We, the
                publicly elected representatives are very concerned that
                something be done to tackle the growing problem of waste.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The present waste-management strategy for
                Northern Ireland is based on three sound principles — reduce,
                reuse and recycle. We should reduce our output of rubbish and
                think carefully about what we use. We should reuse what we can,
                for example, refilling bottles instead of throwing them away. We
                should recycle as much as possible, using the &quot;banks&quot;
                available for bottles, clothes and paper. Recovery is also an
                issue — gaining something of value by composting organic
                materials, and the recovery of energy by incineration or biogas
                plants. We can easily dispose of clinker and ash from
                incinerators by using them for roads and road building. All such
                actions are commendable, but the key lies with the first
                objective — to reduce the production of waste.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We live in a throwaway society where shiny
                new plastic objects are the norm and everything old is thrown in
                the bin or dumped outside, usually in a ditch or bog — a nice
                wet place thought to have no environmental value. Northern
                Ireland needs a re-education policy. There must be an immediate
                culture change to encourage people to use items that are meant
                to last and items that can be repaired and valued.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Expensive household appliances such as
                washing machines are now only required to last a few years. When
                a machine is two or three years old, a maintenance engineer will
                say that it is not worth fixing, it would be cheaper to buy a
                new one. I look forward to the return of the cobbler’s shop,
                to the kiosk where a lady would darn socks and mend ladders, to
                woven shopping baskets and to glass milk bottles. I am sure
                Assembly Members can think of other such examples.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the Rio summit in 1992 it was put forward
                in Agenda 21 that environmentally sound waste management must go
                beyond this mere safe disposal or recovery of wastes that are
                generated and seek to redress the root cause of the problem by
                attempting to change unsustainable patterns of production and
                consumption. That was eight years ago, and nothing has changed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In one way this motion is most worthwhile, at
                this time, especially when the IRA seems to be having a problem
                in zero waste management with regard to the disposing of its
                weapons. May I suggest that the two Gentlemen who put forward
                this motion help their associates commence their own zero waste
                strategy so that they may lead by example. An excellent way
                would be to recycle their armaments for peaceful ends. In the
                words of the Bible, they should</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I cannot support this unrealistic motion or
                the amendment.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am mystified by this motion’s being put
                down in the first place. We have in this Assembly a structure of
                Departments and Committees. The Environment Committee deals with
                this, and both proposers of the motion sit on that Committee.
                That Committee looked at and gave its unanimous support to a
                waste management strategy proposed by the Department. That
                policy was proposed on 20 March 2000 and work has now started on
                its implementation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The targets set by the Alliance Party in its
                amendment would largely be met by the proposals in the waste
                management strategy. Under the strategy, which we are already
                implementing, it is hoped to recover 40% of household waste by
                2010 and 25% by 2005. It is also hoped to reduce the industrial
                and commercial waste landfill to 85% of 1998 levels by 2005, 75%
                of 1995 baseline levels for biodegradable municipal waste by
                2010, 50% by 2013, and 35% by 2000. The proposals in the motion
                and the amendment are already in place. We have already
                supported the recycling of materials legislation, which enforces
                business to become responsible for the waste it produces and
                forces it to recycle 50% of its own waste.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Environment Committee has been working
                with the Department on this issue to ensure that waste is
                reduced. This is not something that has just come out, something
                that the Department has not been working on. And whether it
                wanted to work on it or not is irrelevant. EU directives have
                enforced the Department to react, and it has started work on
                that with the support of the Committee and, subsequently, the
                support of this Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are a number of key principles set out
                in the waste management strategy. The first is the waste
                management hierarchy, which indicates the relevant priority of
                different methods of managing waste. The hierarchy adopted for
                this strategy is reduction, re-use, recycling, energy recovery
                and disposal. The strategy then looks at finding the best
                practicable environmental option, by a systematic and balanced
                assessment of a range of different development options. It looks
                at the best available technology, not entailing excessive costs.
                That is the method used to select a technology that is best at
                preventing pollution and is reasonable to implement in financial
                terms. We have the &quot;polluter pays&quot; principle. Waste
                generators should pay the full costs of providing services to
                manage waste. We have the proximity principle, which is the need
                to treat or dispose of waste in reasonable proximity to the
                point of generation. Finally, we have self-sufficiency, and
                perhaps this impinges on both the motion and the amendment as it
                requires EC members to be self-sufficient in waste management
                practices.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All that is already in place and is up and
                running. I commend the Department on the work that it has done
                so far. The presentations made by Steve&nbsp;Aston and
                Jim&nbsp;Lamont from the Department on these issues were the
                best made to the Committee. They knew what they were doing and
                what the EU directives demanded of them, and they set themselves
                practical, deliverable targets. In dissociating our party from
                the motion and the amendment, I stress that the Department has
                its finger on the pulse of the issue and will have the support
                of our party and our Committee for as long as it is implemented
                and managed sensibly.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr A Doherty:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Just over a week ago the SDLP issued a call
                for a real debate on the important issue of waste management.
                That did not receive wide coverage; waste is not the hottest
                issue for the media or for the public. It has failed to register
                with them that we are living through a quiet, insidious
                ecological meltdown, the effects of which are seen most starkly
                in the far-off famines and other tragedies in what we call the
                Third World. In fact, there is only one world; we are part of
                it, and we are responsible for it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was pleased that the motion appeared on the
                Order Paper so quickly. Perhaps it was a happy coincidence. I
                read the motion with great interest and high expectations. In
                it, the Minister is called upon to</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;agree a waste management strategy which
                would progressively work towards zero waste targets&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is excellent, if rather vague and
                theoretical. Nobody could disagree that such a strategy, if
                successful, would do wonders for the future economic,
                environmental and social well-being of our society. So far, so
                good.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion also says that such targets are</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;to be achieved within a generation,
                that is by the year 2025&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We would all love to see that achieved in
                25&nbsp;years, or even in 50&nbsp;or 100 years. For thousands of
                years, mankind has had a culture of waste and destruction. We
                make, we package, we use a little and discard a lot. We cut and
                slash and dig. We create deserts, dust bowls and wastelands. We
                poison the air and pollute our waterways and seas. That is just
                what we do to our planet; what we do to each other does not bear
                repetition. When did it first dawn on a few enlightened people
                that we live in a finite world with limited resources? It was
                not long ago — a century or so, perhaps. Can all that
                destruction be undone in a generation? I wish that it could.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not want anyone to think that we do not
                take the issue seriously. It is a deadly serious matter, and
                nobody is more conscious of that than the SDLP. We have been
                castigated for being green — on this issue, we are greener
                than green. We are involved with councils and council groups in
                work to develop a realistic waste management strategy, not only
                for Northern Ireland but for the entire island. We are involved
                in joint North/South action and, beyond these islands,
                international co-operation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We heartily endorse the principles of
                minimisation, re-use and recycling. We urge a massive change in
                public appreciation of the role that individuals play in
                creating waste and can play in co-operating to solve waste
                management problems. That will entail a heavy commitment at all
                levels of Government: local, national and international. The
                implementation of waste management strategies will be a
                complicated and expensive process. Ratepayers and taxpayers will
                receive a serious shock. They must be persuaded that the
                benefits far outweigh the costs — costs that can be reduced if
                they are prepared to co-operate fully.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before we can even begin to assess whether
                zero waste is an achievable end for such a process or just a
                noble aspiration, there is a mountain of work to be done. Every
                option at every stage must be analysed, costed and tested
                against the highest environmental standards. Currently, councils
                are heavily engaged in this work, with limited central
                government assistance. Neither their hands nor those of the
                Department should be tied at this stage by the adoption of any
                strategy, unless there is evidence that it has been fully tested
                and proved to be both superior and achievable. We do not have
                that evidence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the Alliance party’s
                amendment, we accept the need to set achievable targets.
                However, it is not right to pre-empt the councils at this stage.
                We should await their deliberations, rather than make policy on
                the hoof, as we are in danger of doing here. We ask Sinn Féin
                to take this motion back, take a close look at it, and put some
                meat on the bones of a rather spare skeleton. If they do so, we
                will be delighted to give their detailed proposals the fullest
                consideration.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Zero waste is an admirable goal. I
                congratulate Mr Murphy for bringing this motion to the Floor of
                the Assembly and encouraging debate on what is, without doubt,
                an important subject. I also thank Mr Poots for providing
                information on where we stand today and the Committee’s work
                in this area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However much we strive to achieve zero waste,
                there will always be a certain amount of residual waste in
                society. Therefore any waste management strategy must place
                greater emphasis on waste minimisation. We agree that there must
                be a fundamental shift in thinking away from the management of
                waste to the prevention of waste. As Joan Carson said, the
                guiding principle should be to reduce, reuse, recycle and
                recover, with the disposal of waste as a last resort only.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also necessary to re-examine the ways
                in which waste is disposed of. We are all aware of the problems
                of landfill, which have been reiterated in the Assembly today.
                We need to encourage a move towards a reduction of waste
                processes in industry, business and the commercial sector.
                Businesses should be encouraged to rethink their design
                processes and recognise that producers have a responsibility
                too.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Partnerships were discussed today.
                Partnerships among the stakeholders in waste management are
                vitally important. We need to look at all the different levels.
                At the regional level, co-operation within Northern Ireland is a
                must. We welcome the coming together of local authorities on
                this issue. Co-operation on the island of Ireland is essential
                because of the potential for joint ventures, for example, in
                reprocessing procedures. We welcome partnerships at the
                cross-border level too — for example, the previously mentioned
                Donegal/Derry/Strabane partnership. Co-operation is also
                required on an East/West basis within these islands, in the
                European Union and on a global scale.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, all this must be underpinned by
                investment at the first level to provide for what the
                householder can do. It is essential that people know what they
                can do on an individual basis, such as home composting and box
                schemes for the collection of paper and plastic. A healthy
                example of this is a pilot programme proposed by Bryson House,
                which some Members may not be aware of. It is a door-to-door,
                multi-recycling programme in partnership with three local
                authorities. Here we have an excellent example of something that
                is going to be up and running.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finance should be provided for this, and at
                least a percentage should come from central sources for these
                projects and for ongoing research into new techniques in waste
                management. Funding should also be considered for existing
                non-governmental organisations (NGOs), and we must not forget
                the very valuable work that they do collaborating with community
                groups, local councils, local businesses and schools to promote
                waste management at grass-roots level. The work of conservation
                volunteers in this area is one example.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is also a need to identify and invest
                in sustainable markets for recyclable products, and there is
                tremendous scope for innovation in terms of design, and so on,
                and in how we reuse our products. This can help to phase out,
                for example, peat-based compost by using waste-derived compost.
                Glass reprocessing is also important, as is the use of processed
                waste paper. An alternative application for reclaimed tyres is
                another example. This helps job creation and contributes to
                economic growth.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should not forget the value of education,
                not only for the public but also for industry and business. The
                Minister should ensure that his Department establishes close
                working relationships with the Department of Education in this
                area so that the authorities responsible for the curriculum
                develop it with waste management issues included at all key
                stages.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The &quot;polluter pays&quot; principle,
                which has been mentioned, should be applied to waste management
                in Northern Ireland. Fees and charges should be set at
                appropriate levels in order to cover fully the cost of waste
                management and enforcement. The landfill tax credit scheme
                should be revised to focus on supporting the implementation of a
                waste management strategy. The use of secondary raw materials
                should be encouraged, possibly by levying additional taxes on
                primary sources.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Above all, central and local government must
                demonstrate leadership in sustainable waste management by
                immediately adopting green housekeeping and purchasing policies.
                To this end, we call for an audit of Stormont and all Government
                buildings regarding basic housekeeping practices in areas such
                as the use of recycled paper, energy-efficient lighting,
                heating, waste disposal and paper.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Waste management is not just about providing
                separate bins for household waste or about handling industrial
                waste. It is about changing attitudes, attracting new
                investment, creating jobs, and, most importantly, it is about
                protecting our health and environment.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I find it somewhat ironic that this motion
                should have been proposed by these two Members. Did they not
                think about the amount of waste that has been consigned to
                landfill as a result of their bombing activities the length and
                breadth of this Province? When they were blowing up Claudy,
                Enniskillen or La Mon did they stop and think about all the
                rubble, glass, and wood that would end up in landfill? If they
                had not created vast tonnage of waste by their own activities
                they might have a right to speak on this issue this evening. Of
                course, who could forget the ultimate waste — the waste of
                3,000 totally innocent lives?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I noticed, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you were
                about to call me to order. I am totally in favour of waste
                management but not as advocated in this motion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we were to go on in the way we are going
                as a society, if everyone in the world were to use the world’s
                resources at the rate that we in Western society are doing, by
                the end of this century we would need three planets to sustain
                us. The only thing that is saving the situation at the moment is
                that Third-World countries are using a fraction of the resources
                that we, as Western society, are using.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One quarter of the world’s energy is used
                by one country — the United States. The average person in the
                EEC and in the United States uses between 60 and 70 times the
                amount of energy and resources that someone in central Africa or
                South America uses. We must grasp this problem, but in an
                achievable way. What is proposed in this motion is not
                achievable. Everyone would like zero waste but that will not
                happen by 2025, or even by 2125.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For once I shall not criticise the Department
                of the Environment because it has grasped the issue and
                developed a waste management strategy. More consultation has
                taken place as part of this strategy than for any other. I have
                been invited to countless meetings about this strategy, and no
                Member can claim that he does not know about it or has not been
                consulted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not a district councillor, but I
                understand that district councils were also consulted widely on
                this vital issue. As the waste disposal authorities, they had to
                be consulted. Members of the party proposing this motion sat in
                district councils along the length and breadth of the country,
                from Londonderry to Newry, and from Fermanagh to Moyle. They
                listened to presentations on the strategy and gave it their seal
                of approval. The proposal then went before a series of public
                meetings at which we, as public representatives, were entitled
                to express our views. I went to at least two meetings and heard
                nothing from those representing Sinn Féin/IRA at local
                government level. Its members sat placidly and accepted what was
                being suggested.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposal then went before the Environment
                Committee, which questioned Dr Aston and his colleagues closely.
                I am not on the Environment Committee, but I wish I were because
                I would like to have had the opportunity to question him too.
                After that vigorous questioning the Committee gave the proposal
                its firm seal of approval.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This document has been well and truly aired.
                One reason it has generally been accepted is that the targets in
                it are attainable. I wish that the targets were more stringent
                and that we could have greater waste reduction, but at the
                moment that cannot be done.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In a previous incarnation I did a study on
                waste disposal for a conservation organisation. One of the
                tremendous barriers to adequate waste management in Northern
                Ireland is the fact that we have 26 waste disposal authorities
                in the form of 26 district councils. Each authority tries, if at
                all possible, to run its own waste disposal site. The problem is
                that the huge capital resources required for waste management
                are spread among 26 authorities which, apart from Belfast, are
                relatively small. In Leicester, which has a population
                equivalent to that of Northern Ireland, all waste is disposed of
                at two sites. Northern Ireland has about 40 publicly managed and
                private landfill sites. The Department faces enormous problems
                and must therefore set targets which are realistic.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must give the Department the resources,
                encouragement and political support that it needs to ensure that
                it not only meets but tries to exceed those targets.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the Assembly must put its own house
                in order. Its use of resources is absolutely disgraceful. How
                many forests have been chopped down to provide paper for this
                institution? Where is the so-called paperless office that we
                were promised? Day after day the postman groans under the weight
                of paper from the Assembly. Does all our paper come from
                recycled sources? Is the paper that is thrown into the bins in
                our offices and outside our buildings recycled? I have been
                asking those questions, and no one can give me the answers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On many counts, people could rightly say that
                we are setting a target for them but that the Assembly needs to
                put its own house in order. I support what the hon&nbsp;Lady for
                North Down (Ms&nbsp;Morrice) said about the creation of an
                environmental audit committee. The Assembly needs a committee to
                consider what it is doing with its own waste and to make
                recommendations to the Executive about cutting down the vast
                amount of waste that is so evident in all Government Departments
                in the Province.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A practical measure that we could take from
                next week is recommend that the Assembly sign up for the eco
                tariff for electricity. All the electricity that is used in
                Government offices in Northern Ireland would then be purchased
                from an energy pool that comes from sustainable sources, such as
                wind and wave power.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That would send out the most enormous signal
                to the community that the Assembly means business as far as the
                future of our Province is concerned. The world simply cannot
                sustain the way in which we are currently going. The people are
                looking to us for an example. We should give the Department the
                political support and resources it needs to implement the plan.
                That is the way forward.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If, by doing that, we feel we can increase
                the targets, increase the amount of recycling and control over
                the use of energy and waste, all well and good. However, it
                would be nonsensical if the Department, having gone through that
                lengthy process — which unfortunately generated a lot of waste
                paper in its own right — said &quot;Everyone has agreed that
                policy and we are happy with the targets, but we are scrapping
                all that. We are going for a zero waste strategy by 2025.&quot;
                That is not practical.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Alliance Party — in particular,
                Mr&nbsp;Ford, who is normally a sensible individual — is not
                prone to the &quot;Dallat factor&quot;. Most of his motions are
                thought through, but there is a wee bit of the &quot;Dallat
                factor&quot; in this one. Mr&nbsp;Ford knows that this issue is
                too important to be clouded by political dogma, and
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland is a big enough unit to deal with the
                waste strategy by itself. We produce so much waste that the
                economies of scale are such that we can tackle this problem as a
                Province. We do not need to run to Dublin to establish
                cross-border bodies — there is plenty of waste to be going on
                with in the Province.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wells:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member knows our deep suspicion of
                proposals for any form of cross-border bodies — we know the
                hidden intent behind them. The concern is not about waste, but
                the gradual absorption of the two parts of Ireland. Needless to
                say, we are not interested in going down that route. We can
                solve this problem ourselves. We should give the Department the
                support it deserves.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Hanna:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to question the sense in tabling a
                motion that, for the most part, is unrealistic. Unfortunately,
                the motion is framed in absolutist, all-or-nothing terms. The
                proposer should know that those who demand all often end up with
                nothing. I strongly support the concept of a waste management
                strategy that will achieve the highest possible waste recycling
                targets. No society in the world recycles 100% of its waste,
                including countries such as Germany and Switzerland, which have
                been far more environmentally proactive and aware than us for
                decades.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of the Environment published a
                waste management strategy for Northern&nbsp;Ireland based on
                wide consultation with a large number of
                environmentally-interested groups. It was able to obtain a large
                degree of consensus in formulating the strategy. More
                importantly, it is now up to the 26&nbsp;district councils to
                co-operate, working at the sharp end of waste management, in
                producing and implementing a strategy on the ground, based on
                the strategy document.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No one has questioned the general thrust of
                the strategy, although there is room for debate over the target
                being set. I believe the target is too low. The motion does not
                make it clear what zero waste means. Does it mean that by 2025
                our society will produce no waste?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It may be a pious aspiration, but it is
                unrealistic. The danger of adopting such an unrealistic target
                is that it may be counter-productive and undermine the
                development of programmes to deal with the grubby reality of the
                waste problem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Northern Ireland there is a 3% increase in
                the production of waste each year, and we recycle less than 2%.
                There is evidence that there is a linkage between economic
                growth and increased production of waste. We need to develop the
                creativity and ingenuity to break that linkage. We are a
                throw-away society, and a massive education programme and
                culture change are needed to persuade the population to face up
                to the implications of what they are putting in their bins every
                week. People need to start taking responsibility for the
                environment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need incentives to encourage recycling,
                and deterrents to make the polluter pay. But in the meantime
                what are we doing with all this rubbish, bearing in mind the EU
                regulations on landfill? We are still putting batteries,
                fluorescent tubes, paints, adhesives, medicines, weedkiller,
                insecticides, polish, detergents and oil into our landfill
                sites. We have a long way to go. What are we doing with our
                waste in this Building? That question was asked earlier, and we
                need to tackle that issue and lead by example.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to set serious, challenging,
                realistic, but achievable, targets, and make sure that they are
                pursued vigorously. At present there are very low levels of
                recycling of household waste. We need to develop programmes for
                the more sustainable management of that waste. There is
                currently a very low demand for recycled material. Developing
                new, economically viable and stable markets for recycled
                material is a massive task.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wells:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Member agree that if we, as an
                Assembly, along with the 10 Government Departments, decided,
                from a certain date, that we would only use recycled materials,
                it would give an enormous boost to the recycled material market
                in Northern Ireland?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Hanna:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will consider that, but in the meantime I
                will finish my points. We will need help from many bodies,
                operating at a more global level, if we are to develop
                sustainable markets. We must foster a society preference for
                recycled goods and a culture of repair, rather than replacement.
                The SDLP is, of course, committed, through the Annex to Strand
                Two of the Good Friday Agreement, to North/South co-operation on
                environmental protection, pollution, water quality and waste
                management. I acknowledge that polluters do not recognise
                borders or separate jurisdictions. The SDLP is in favour of
                establishing an all-Ireland environmental protection agency and
                all-Ireland markets for recyclable materials to cover what is,
                after all, a small island of 32,000 square miles and five
                million people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to take the issue of waste management
                very seriously, but realistically. We are always aspiring to
                achieving higher targets of reducing, reusing, recycling and
                recovering.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hussey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the thrust of the amendment as it
                represents a much more realistic approach to the growing problem
                of waste management than the original motion, which I regard,
                and I gather others regard, as an unobtainable, idealistic
                expression. The zero waste idea may come more from a possible
                electoral threat in the Republic. I understand that a zero waste
                group may be fielding candidates there, and perhaps the
                proposers of the motion are more concerned about that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I feel that Mr Ford, in his
                amendment, might have been better looking at EU targets for
                waste production and, indeed, the proposals coming from the
                Environment Committee, as outlined so well by Mr&nbsp;Poots. Mr
                Wells has referred to the number of authorities with
                responsibility. Again, through the discussions this afternoon,
                Members will be aware of the establishment of a number of
                council consortia to address the waste management strategy
                requirements. I heartily welcome such co-operation.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My own council is one of the constituent
                bodies in the north-west region cross-border group of councils,
                which includes Donegal, as has been mentioned. I welcome the
                proposal’s recognition that waste management may need to be
                addressed, where appropriate, on a cross-border basis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a recognition that a proper strategy
                to deal with waste requires a critical mass to ensure
                economically effective outcomes. I trust that all Members can
                agree that the aim of any option on waste management under
                consideration is to target the least environmental impact within
                the bounds of economic viability. I sincerely believe that a
                balanced option of prevention, reduction, re-use, recovery and
                disposal is appropriate and can deliver targets while focusing
                resources to minimise costs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion partly addresses tools that can be
                used in the recovery process — namely, recycling and
                composting. There will still be a residual, unusable waste, and
                I believe that the proper recovery tool here is energy from
                waste, thus utilising residual waste and further reducing that
                which will have to go to landfill. Despite the prior extraction
                of many materials, new processes and energy-to-waste ensure
                clean burn of residual unusable waste, notwithstanding its
                reduced calorific value. One has only to look at Denmark, where,
                I understand, there are about 30 energy-to-waste plants there.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are many issues for consideration such
                as waste generation and reduction at source. Mr&nbsp;Murphy
                suggested that manufacturers should take a lead role on that and
                I totally agree with him. Mr&nbsp;Ford dealt with separation at
                source, and again I agree with him. Education was mentioned by
                Ms&nbsp;Hanna and Mrs&nbsp;Carson, and nobody can disagree with
                the fact that people need to be educated. Markets for recovered
                materials and research and development were mentioned, and the
                suggestion was that there needs to be some sort of Government
                intervention in these areas. Perhaps this Assembly should
                suggest — and I totally agree — that we should be using
                recycled materials. Members will note that I am using a recycled
                notepad.</p>

                and acceptable solution to the problem of waste management in
                the future. Was landfill tax an environmental tax or a
                revenue-raising tax? If additional funding to ensure efficient
                and effective waste management strategies cannot be made
                available via a greater level of support from landfill tax
                credits, we will then know the answer as to whether this
                Government at Westminster was a green or a money-grabbing one.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Developing a waste strategy is not a problem.
                The problem lies in persuading the public to pay for its
                delivery and achieving the targets set in it. To do that, there
                would have to be significant changes in public attitudes. People
                would have to pay significantly more in taxes, so there could be
                greater financial input and fundamental revisions of the
                existing planning regime. Without these elementary principles,
                the aims and aspirations for a national waste strategy will
                never be realised.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Britain and Ireland there is significantly
                less investment in waste management than in other European
                countries. To date the producers of waste are but bystanders,
                not directly responsible for the serious amount of waste they
                generate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Northern Ireland the arrangements for
                waste disposal are hopelessly inadequate, even piecemeal. The
                problem can only get worse for local authorities that provide
                disposal facilities as opposition to waste disposal sites
                intensifies. We may not have even started to win the hearts and
                minds of the public, to change its attitudes to waste
                minimisation and waste recycling. This is elementary and should
                begin at school, be brought home to the family and carried on to
                the work place. The Government’s national waste strategy
                focuses on household waste, which accounts for only 5% of waste
                production. It is unclear whether the targets for commercial and
                industrial waste are purely aspirational, or even legally
                binding. Many other key areas are addressed inadequately, if at
                all.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As members of the public, we may ask
                &quot;What can we do?&quot; And the answer is one word —
                &quot;Plenty.&quot; Every year over 400 million metric tonnes of
                waste is generated in the UK, and it is estimated that an
                average household produces over a tonne of waste per year. If
                every family were to start a compost heap at the bottom of its
                garden and give its backing to recycling, we would have begun to
                create the ethos for a much cleaner environment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Government have set a target for 17% of
                household waste to be recycled or composted by 2004. Is this
                achievable and who will verify it? Municipal waste is increasing
                at the rate of 3% per annum. Over 60% of our personal
                consumption is on food and alcohol. Satisfying this demand leads
                not only to materials being prepared, packaged and transported,
                sometimes for thousands of miles, but also to the increasing use
                of take-aways, which has resulted in packaging being disposed of
                on the streets. If everyone works together, we can tackle this
                throwaway society. How will we achieve it? The Government have
                made available £25 million over three years towards the Waste
                and Resource Action Programme (WRAP). However, this money will
                be wasted if there are no long-term sustainable markets and end
                uses for recycled material. Even if all funding for waste
                management is added up, we will find that we will still spend no
                more than £1 per person per year over the next three years,
                which is not a lot.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a national issue that has to be
                addressed by everyone. For us, the issue is an all-Ireland one.
                Pollution in all its evil forms does not stop at the border, and
                there are many benefits should we adopt an overall strategy for
                the whole island.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Peering into the future is easy. In the
                nineteenth century we had the Industrial Revolution. The
                twentieth century brought a revolution in information
                technology. However, we are not sure what the twenty-first
                century will be remembered for. Waste and how we manage it is a
                serious challenge. At least we now have strategies and are
                attempts are being made to impose targets, but we still need to
                talk seriously about waste prevention and avoidance. Waste has
                been the Cinderella of the utility services for too long. We
                have seen fundamental changes in the way we deal with waste over
                the last 100 years, not least with the new technologies and the
                changes that are generally perceived to be best practice.
                Throughout the twentieth century there was a need to safeguard
                the environment and develop public confidence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the spirit of the motion, but I
                doubt if its aspirations will be achievable. Much depends on the
                resources available and whether people are prepared to bear the
                increased costs. Much depends on how we educate society about
                waste disposal. Most importantly, we must develop a collective
                responsibility on this crucial issue. The motion has allowed the
                different parties to lay their ideas before the House. The next
                logical step is to have all the issues raised thoroughly
                examined and taken on board so that and our vision for a
                waste-management strategy can be achieved.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of the Environment (Mr Foster):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no doubt that this has been a most
                interesting debate. I thank those who participated and those who
                have acknowledged our presentation on the waste management
                strategy. I am sure that this afternoon’s discussion will not
                go to waste.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important to look after the
                environment. If the sun, moon and stars were in the predatory
                hands of the human race, they would probably not exist. Let us
                proceed with care. Let us not raise unrealistic expectations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was glad to be able to listen to the debate
                on one of the most significant challenges facing society,
                business, the Assembly, my Department and district councils. The
                challenge has major environmental, economic and social
                implications. Should our strategy for facing this challenge be
                based on a laudable but aspirational approach to increasing the
                amount of waste that is recycled and composted? Alternatively,
                should we place our hopes on the pragmatic, consensus-based
                waste management strategy published by my Department, with my
                endorsement and that of the Assembly’s Environment Committee?
                Waste is an everyday fact, which will have unpleasant, long-term
                consequences if we fail to find realistic and sustainable
                solutions to it. We need to produce much less of it and manage
                much better that which we do produce.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We want less waste because the energy used to
                extract, transport and turn raw materials into products has a
                high cost. The money, production time and often scarce raw
                materials needed are precious commodities which no individual or
                organisation should squander.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A primary goal of sustainable development is,
                therefore, to minimise waste. That is why reducing waste is at
                the top of the list of options set out in the Northern Ireland
                waste management strategy. We should not lose sight of the
                aspiration to maximise recycling and composting activities. At
                the same time, it must be unrealistic to expect a transition
                from recycling less than 5% of household waste to 50% of all
                waste without identifying the practical and progressive steps
                that will lead us there. All our experience and consultation
                leads us to that conclusion. We must continue to aim for what is
                achievable. To reach that goal we must have a strategic approach
                which will ensure that all stakeholders, businesses, communities
                and individuals can share the responsibility for making the
                strategy work. It must be based on a high level of consensus and
                participation across the whole of society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This was a fundamental principle that
                dictated the way the current Northern Ireland waste management
                strategy was developed. I will illustrate this by a short
                description of the process. The strategy was developed over
                three years through a programme of extensive consultation
                involving three distinct steps. That was referred to this
                afternoon — maybe this is a recycling process. The first step
                was the formation of a steering group to agree the scope of the
                strategy and an approach which would engage all stakeholders.
                The group comprised the Society of Local Authority Chief
                Executives, the Confederation of British Industry and the
                Northern Ireland Environmental Link, represented by Friends of
                the Earth. An awareness campaign using television, radio and the
                press was followed by a series of open workshops. Everyone who
                might be affected, or who expressed an interest, was invited to
                discuss their ideas and to suggest how to overcome obstacles
                that might challenge the opportunity to make a real difference
                in how we tackle this vital issue. Participants from across
                Northern Ireland society ranged from community to corporate
                groups and from councils to college pupils. Their suggestions
                laid the foundations for change.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second step was an intensive series of
                face-to-face meetings with industry sectors, together with
                officers and elected members from each of the 26 district
                councils. Their ideas were then built into draft policy
                proposals for change, and these were issued for public
                consultation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The third step was to establish an
                independent advisory group comprising representatives from the
                private and public sectors, non-governmental organisations and
                the environmental professions. Their review of the stakeholder
                consultation led to 104 recommendations for further enhancement
                of the proposals. Of these, 98 were incorporated into the final
                strategy. The final policy proposals fully reflected the
                objectives and principles of sustainable development. They were
                also fully consistent with Northern Ireland’s obligations
                under the relevant EC directives and international conventions,
                and were and are coherent with parallel initiatives in the rest
                of the UK and in the Republic of Ireland.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposed strategy was examined and
                endorsed by the Environment Committee. The final, agreed waste
                management strategy was launched in March this year. The
                inclusive and extensive nature of the consultation that marked
                this development has led to wide support for the strategy across
                all major stakeholders. That launch marked not the completion of
                the process but its continuation. The strategy has in-built
                review arrangements that take effect after the first three
                years. That will enable all of us to assess the impact of the
                measures in the strategy and to refine the policies if there are
                any performance shortfalls. We will also have the benefit of the
                views of an independent advisory board, which will monitor and
                report on progress.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland is required to have a waste
                management strategy in order to satisfy the requirements of the
                European Waste Framework Directive. Not only does this current
                strategy meet these mandatory obligations, but it has also been
                designed to achieve other goals: to protect public health and
                the environment; to provide a secure platform for business
                growth; and to build public confidence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The key aim of the strategy is to achieve
                fully sustainable waste management. This means using material
                resources more efficiently to cut down on the amount of waste
                produced. Where waste is generated, it means dealing with it in
                a way that minimises impacts on the environment and contributes
                positively to economic development and social progress.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The strategy comprises a range of policy
                measures including leadership, planning, regulation, information
                and marketing. Good progress has been made in the first six
                months. My Department has introduced new controls and completed
                important data studies. District councils have done excellent
                work on the development of comprehensive waste management plans,
                which they are to submit to my Department early next year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, in the context of today’s motion I
                want to focus on the strategy’s key policy areas of waste
                reduction, recovery and recycling. The strategy attempts to
                change attitudes to waste by directing our attention to the full
                life cycle of materials and products. It helps us to stop
                consigning what are otherwise valuable materials to an expanding
                stream of waste. It allows us to concentrate on the strategy’s
                policies and programmes to encourage everyone to realise the
                true value of these materials as a secondary resource capable of
                exploitation, and not as waste or &quot;a problem&quot;. That
                approach is exemplified in the strategy’s programme for market
                development and its proposals for best practice schemes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this way, and by setting out challenging
                and specific targets for different categories of materials —
                tyres, plastics, paper, glass — the waste management strategy
                sets us on the road to significantly increased recovery and
                recycling. Even more importantly, the strategy details positive,
                practical and realistic steps that could take us a significant
                way down that road, even if they do not lead to its achievement
                within the timescale envisaged by the proposers of this motion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At its heart the strategy seeks to redefine
                how we view and handle waste and enable a progressive transition
                towards integrated resource management. It encourages waste
                reduction and improved product design. In the short and medium
                term this must be complemented by significant improvements in
                recycling and recovery. Therefore, an overall target to recover
                25% of household waste by 2005 and 40% by 2010 underpins the
                strategy. These targets incorporate minimal thresholds for
                recycling and composting at 15% and 25% respectively.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Meeting these targets will bring significant
                environmental and economic benefits to Northern Ireland. To make
                sure that they are achieved, the strategy addresses the need to
                develop supporting infrastructure and markets for recycled
                materials.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, to work successfully, the strategy
                will have to continue to involve everyone: from householders to
                company directors, from community groups to local and central
                Government. We must remember that the aims of sustainable waste
                management, and the obligations imposed by European waste
                directives, are common to all member states, including the
                Republic of Ireland. Moreover, one of the areas identified for
                enhanced co-operation under the North/South Ministerial Council
                is &quot;the scope for improved waste management in a
                cross-border context&quot;. When I reported back to the Assembly
                after the first meeting of the North/South Ministerial Council
                is environment sector, several Members expressed an interest in
                this topic. Both the North and the South will be faced with
                similar problems under these European directives. We will both
                need to divert increasing quantities of waste away from landfill
                sites and towards more sustainable waste management practices.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The north-west region’s cross-border group
                has demonstrated the benefit to be gained from co-operation.
                This group comprises seven Northern Ireland councils and Donegal
                County Council. The group has reviewed what makes the best
                economic and environmental sense for the provision of waste
                services in its area. I am pleased that my Department has been
                able to provide financial assistance for this work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another good example of the cross-border
                dimension is NI2000, which gives advice to schools and voluntary
                groups on recycling. In conjunction with a group based in
                Dublin, it has produced an all-Ireland recycling directory,
                which will be launched in December. I hope to attend the event
                along with Noel Dempsey, my counterpart in the Republic.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I said at the outset, waste is a matter of
                fact. It is not a matter of fiction, but an everyday truth that
                affects our daily lives at every level. We should continue to
                aspire to maximum use of that waste as a beneficial resource.
                However, more realistically, we need to acknowledge that, for
                the foreseeable future, there will continue to be a substantial
                level of waste to be dealt with. Our task and our responsibility
                is to ensure that this fraction gets smaller and smaller every
                year. The Northern Ireland waste management strategy establishes
                a framework within which we can achieve that goal and establish
                Northern Ireland as a centre of excellence in resource and waste
                management.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By encouraging changes to product designs and
                by developing a recovery, re-use and recycling infrastructure,
                we can and we will continually improve our ability to extract
                value from materials previously wasted. We can and will build
                markets on a Northern Ireland, an all-Ireland and a UK-wide
                basis. These are crucial factors for change, and the strategy
                makes clear provision for them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have adopted widely-supported new policies
                which will make a major contribution to safeguarding the
                environment and promoting resource efficiency; these will also
                lead to significant job opportunities. No standard for the
                protection of the environment or public health will be
                compromised through successful implemention of the strategy;
                neither will this opportunity to do the right thing for present
                and future generations be lost.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Northern Ireland waste management
                strategy is built on realism, consensus and best practice. It
                would be foolhardy to replace it with unrealistic aspiration. We
                need to allow the strategy to unlock the full potential for the
                development and improvement of waste management in Northern
                Ireland. The strategy sets targets, not limits, and people are
                welcome to exceed the targets. Nobody is trying to stifle them.
                If councils and others find a way to exceed those targets, they
                will have my most enthusiastic support. The strategy is not
                static. It will be subject to regular review, when we will all
                have an opportunity to take stock of the strategy and if
                necessary, to discuss it. I ask Members to reflect carefully on
                this when they come to vote and to confirm their support for the
                existing waste management strategy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reference has been made to the importance of
                education in waste disposal methods. I am pleased to announce
                that my Department, together with the Department of Enterprise,
                Trade and Investment, is organising a three-day international
                conference and exhibition in the Waterfront Hall next February.
                It will be directed at international designs for products made
                from recycled materials. For one day of the conference, entry
                will be exclusively for schools.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will attempt to obey your injunction, Sir,
                and stick to a family-friendly short speech. There are three
                main areas. Some Members raised issues of housekeeping,
                particularly about the Assembly, but also about wider government
                functions. It may not be entirely appropriate to this motion,
                but I will ensure the Commission takes note. There were also
                some useful comments by Ms Morrice and Mr Wells.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The cross-border issue was raised. Mr Poots
                and Mr Wells knee-jerked too quickly, and they should have taken
                the time to read what was said, and listen to Derek Hussey about
                the practical benefits of the cross-border co-operation in which
                Strabane is involved. Hopefully we can get away from
                knee-jerking too much every time these issues are raised. They
                should note that there has been an all-Ireland strategy for
                clinical waste, which has not created too many problems for my
                Unionist Colleagues in Antrim who are involved in it. So, there
                may be hope yet.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue is about where the Assembly takes
                its opinion on existing strategy, and how we move on from that.
                Mr Poots attacked me on behalf of the Minister, although the
                Minister did not feel the need to do likewise, so I am grateful
                for that. My opening remarks supported the efforts of the
                Minister and his officials, notably Steve Aston, and I broadly
                support the strategy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Environment Committee approved the
                strategy in draft form, but it did so in a hurry immediately
                before suspension. That broad approval should not prevent those
                who sat on the Committee from making further suggestions that
                may be helpful, whether or not they are entirely in accord with
                the printing of that strategy.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wells:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fact is that the hon Member’s
                councillors, throughout Northern Ireland, sat at consultation
                meetings — I was at several of them — and agreed the broad
                strategy of the Department’s proposals. It is a bit rich to
                try and amend it at this late stage.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can I assume that the Member would be
                prepared to stand by every word spoken by every DUP councillor
                on other matters?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Comments around the Chamber suggested that
                the motion was unrealistic. My party was the only one to produce
                an amendment to make it — as others have termed it —
                &quot;slightly more realistic&quot;, and that should not be a
                basis for criticising us. Others could have put down amendments
                but did not do so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The amendment is not entirely in line with
                current strategy but is a nudge towards improvement. It is based
                on further information we received about what is being achieved
                in councils in England and Wales and we believe it is an
                entirely appropriate slight change to what was being said. We
                are not trying to stand the strategy on its head but are seeking
                to encourage the Department ever further in the appropriate
                direction. That is an entirely reasonably way to put an
                amendment to the House, and I commend the amendment that is
                being proposed.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McLaughlin:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.
                It was a very interesting debate. I particularly thank the
                Minister and his officials for their courtesy and in
                demonstrating their interest and commitment by being present
                throughout the debate. My party recognises and acknowledges
                that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Members and the Minister have reiterated
                their concerns about the environment, and that reflects a broad
                consensus within our society. All have argued, with different
                emphasis, for reduction, recycling and recovery. Some have
                addressed the issue of the disappointing targets we have set
                ourselves. On a number of occasions, reference was made to the
                extensive consultation that has taken place. It is my view that
                there is, as a result of that consultation, a heightened
                awareness — the education process that was referred to — and
                also an expectation that we will do more. Given the reality of
                the impact on our environment we must do more.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This motion does not contradict or overturn
                the waste management strategy. It adds value to it, and there is
                no conflict in that. Guiding principles provide a measuring tool
                to ensure that these initial and modest targets in the present
                strategy can be added to continually.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am encouraged by two points in the Minister’s
                comprehensive response. The first is the announcement of the
                joint action by two Departments — an issue of particular
                interest to me. It is very significant that the Department of
                Enterprise, Trade and Investment and the Department of the
                Environment should co-host a conference on these issues.
                Secondly, there is confirmation that the strategy is not static
                and that we will continue to develop it. The Minister made
                reference to the document on waste management strategy and he
                quoted from it a section which deals with the strategy’s key
                aim of achieving fully sustainable waste management.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The same section of the document outlines the
                Department’s role, which has guided our approach to the issue:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Department of the Environment will
                take the lead in implementing the strategy in conjunction with
                all major stakeholder groups. The challenge is to unlock the
                full potential of development and improvement of the waste
                management sector in Northern Ireland. This will make a major
                contribution to safeguarding the environment and promoting
                resource efficiency and economic growth.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is an extract from the formal document.
                This is Environment Week and, therefore, a particularly good
                time to hold this debate. The motion reflects current and
                emerging legislation from Westminister, Leinster House and the
                European Parliament, while addressing the aspirations of the
                waste management strategy document. In relation to the
                amendment, because such modest targets have been set, as
                reflected in the broad remit of the motion, it has proved
                procedurally impossible to incorporate the argument. We argue in
                terms of generation and approach this issue on the basis of what
                can be achieved over 25&nbsp;years. Members have indicated their
                concerns, and it is clear from their arguments that there has
                been a great deal of research and interest in this issue. This
                demonstrates what can be achieved. People were able to tell us
                what had been achieved in other areas, but I would have
                preferred it if they had explored what could be achieved in
                another 25 years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some municipal authorities have already
                achieved 50% reduction targets but where will they be in another
                25&nbsp;years? Using this as our datum point, where will we be
                in 25&nbsp;years? The amendment does not address that, which is
                unfortunate given the unanimous concern for environmental issues
                which was expressed during this debate. It is a pity that people
                did not attempt to raise the threshold, our ambitions or our
                expectations, as this motion does. We could examine those waste
                reduction policies enforced by legislation, some of which is
                already emerging from the European Parliament, Westminster and
                Leinster&nbsp;House. This would enable us to address the
                powerful economic and environmental imperatives which demand
                waste streaming at source. This would also address the
                employment potential of developing the market for secondary
                materials via manufacturing through recycling. We should
                consider the benefit of an initiative taken by the Minister on
                behalf of the Executive. This challenge requires leadership to
                develop a zero waste policy, supported by enabling legislation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We could then challenge other Departments and
                set a positive example by calling, for instance, for a social
                economy and jobs audit as part of every sub-regional waste
                management plan. This would ensure that the mid-term and the
                long-term economic potential and financial savings which could
                be derived from a zero waste strategy were fully recognised and
                pursued. Other Departments, such as Enterprise, Trade and
                Investment, are researching secondary materials market
                development, including export potentials. They are promoting
                research and development to identify synergies between the
                information technology sector and material recovery initiatives,
                seed-funding pilot programmes and seed-funding material recovery
                incubators.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Education could integrate
                into the curriculum a programme of education for sustainable
                development in the context of active citizenship and lifelong
                learning.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department for Social Development could
                usefully research the links between sustainable development and
                social development, including the social spin-offs from
                community-based solutions to waste management.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Agriculture and Rural
                Development could lead efforts to maximise composting by
                providing the appropriate infrastructure for materials recovery
                in rural areas, thus ensuring that Ireland’s low dioxin
                content in farm animals remains a feature of our marketing
                strategies protecting the green profile that is available for
                the future marketing of organic produce as well.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure
                could stimulate the arts, culture and communications sectors to
                engage in the important task of popularising new attitudes to
                our environment in public places.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Finance and Personnel could
                implement a new incentive structure to support eco-modernisation
                and abolish perverse incentives for incineration.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, the Department of Health, Social
                Services and Public Safety could ensure that the best
                international research on the health implications of
                incineration and landfill are available to the decision-makers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clearly a policy-driven commitment from our
                Executive will address these and many other opportunities, to
                develop a zero waste programme. This motion provides an
                opportunity for the Assembly to take the first steps in
                achieving such a policy position. From the viewpoint of current
                waste management systems, the argument for incinerators is that
                the structure of the waste profession is unaltered, and
                innovation is limited to the provision of machinery. For large
                centralised institutions such as Governments, waste companies
                and machinery suppliers, these are often decisive
                considerations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, incinerators now evoke levels of
                opposition similar to those in respect of nuclear power, and the
                main reason is the health and environmental impacts of
                emissions. Because the input of municipal incinerators is mixed
                waste, it is difficult, if not impossible, to control the
                hazardous elements in it. It is generally accepted that the
                combustion process emits hazardous substances, such as dioxin,
                and as long as the materials being burnt are hazardous, or are
                made so by combustion, the plant itself will be a potential
                hazard through emissions into the atmosphere or the deposit of
                toxins in ash deposits.</p>

                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McLaughlin:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No, I will not if the Member does not mind.
                We had a broad discussion, and I have to pick up on some of the
                arguments that were presented. Perhaps the Member will excuse
                me.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What we do with our waste and how we process
                it is an issue that is at the core of many other environmental
                problems. Furthermore, it falls within the remit of this
                Assembly and the Executive, so we can do something about it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we, as a society, really want to solve the
                waste management problem effectively and efficiently, and above
                all in an environmentally sensitive way, then that will involve
                a complete reassessment of how we, as a society, respond to
                these issues. It will mean looking at the commercial packaging
                of the products we buy and consume; it will mean lobbing the
                Westminster Parliament to ensure that we can have effective
                legislation so that these problems can be addressed at source;
                and it will mean tackling clearly, at a national level, the
                issue of the recycling of all waste.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When talking about critical mass it is
                economic nonsense to argue that we could sustain such a market,
                particularly in terms of the initial start-up cost within the
                context of the Six Counties. This is an island-wide problem, and
                we can develop island-wide solutions. It will mean opening our
                minds to other options that are currently not being discussed at
                a local government or central Government level. The reality is
                that 50% of landfill waste should not be there in the first
                place — and, by the way, that is a Department of the
                Environment statistic.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first question that comes to mind is
                whether the waste is reusable or recyclable. On the island of
                Ireland less than 10% of the waste dumped in local authorities’
                sites is being recycled. That is a statistic of failure and
                short-sightedness.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many experts have contributed to the debate
                and have commented on it. Robin Murray has produced a very
                interesting book, published last year, called ‘Creating Wealth
                from Waste’, and he says</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;all of this is now changing&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In his book he has highlighted three
                important factors that are turning waste and waste management
                into a dynamic, fast-changing, international economic sector.
                People might be interested to learn that waste management is
                already the second largest growth area in economic activity in
                the North.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is growing concern about the hazards of
                waste disposal; there are broader environmental concerns,
                especially global warming and resource depletion. Economic
                opportunities are being created by new waste regulations and
                technological innovation. All that leads us to consideration of
                a programme for zero waste — here I address the detractors and
                the faint-hearted directly. California, the home of Silicon
                Valley, is now in the vanguard of environmental transformation.
                The Californian waste diversion law, the Integrated Waste
                Management Act (AB 939), was passed in 1989, and within seven
                years nearly a quarter of all the municipalities in that region
                had reached the target of 50%. That is driven by a zero waste
                policy. Nova Scotia, a delegation from which is, as I speak, in
                this country visiting Galway, has a target to achieve it within
                the next five years. Holland has already reached 72% nationwide,
                a figure which continues to rise. This is the result of
                long-term planning and thinking and of achievable objectives.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today’s motion invites us to develop zero
                waste targets to be achieved in a 25-year period.
                Coincidentally, 25 years is also the length of an incinerator
                contract. Both options invite us to think in generations. The
                difference between the two is that the zero waste approach seeks
                to reduce with the aim of eliminating while the other promotes a
                dying technology and assumes a continuing or rising level of
                waste.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is sometimes argued, by people who really
                should know better, that the rigorous safety standards now set
                down for the operation of incinerators are a reliable guarantee
                that the health of local populations will not be compromised.
                However, a 1997 survey in Japan found that only eight of 1,500
                operating incinerators met international dioxin emission
                standards. In Germany more than a million people signed
                petitions against incinerators after similar scandals and
                disclosures. In France a Government survey of incinerator
                emissions in 1998 led to the closure of 20 plants, while others
                were put on probation. High dioxin levels in milk produced near
                an incinerator further heightened concern. In Britain itself,
                two of the most modern incinerators reported 183 emissions
                infringements between the years 1995 and 1998.</p>

                names if he needs them, for I have them here.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Four major advantages have been observed from
                the implementation of the zero waste approach in other
                countries. There is a lesson in them for the sceptics amongst us
                and for this Assembly. They are the environment, economic
                regeneration and employment, the quality of life itself, and the
                practicality of recycling. Waste minimisation measures, and in
                particular regulations which place responsibility for them on
                those who can design it away, reduce material use and ease its
                reuse.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Germany the very stringent laws that
                country has introduced have reduced quantities of packaging
                materials by 13%. German industry is now engaged in close-loop
                design, which indicates further major material reductions. In
                Canada, the National Packaging Protocol achieved 50% recycling
                and reduction by 1996. Those materials reclaimed through
                recycling have been found by a series of significant
                international studies to offer major environmental savings by
                replacing virgin materials. In the United States the 1994 Tellus
                study carried out a life-cycle inventory of 13 packaging
                materials and concluded that the decisive environmental benefit
                of recycling stems from the avoidance of the environmental cost
                which would have resulted from the extraction and processing of
                the displaced virgin materials.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The organisational structure — and, indeed,
                the culture — required to develop intensive diversion is
                markedly different to that of the traditional disposal industry,
                whether the issue be landfill or incineration. That is why it
                has been difficult for many in the traditional waste industry
                and in local authorities to encourage or even to envisage any
                diversion other than the building of bottle bank collections
                with only modest projections of recovery levels. All of that
                clearly points to the need for a zero waste strategy.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall conclude with some interesting
                figures. Globally, 1998 was the warmest year measured in
                history. The top 10 warmest years measured worldwide over the
                last 120 years all occurred after 1981, with the six warmest of
                those occurring after 1990. That gives us all reason to be
                concerned. When one considers that major reinsurance companies
                have calculated that economic losses due to weather extremes
                have increased by a factor of eight since the 1960s, one can see
                the urgency of taking action. I urge the Assembly to set
                achievable but ambitious targets and to work within the
                framework of a zero waste policy towards ever escalating levels
                of achievement.</p>

                not a parochial debate about the Mournes, but is about the
                greater issue of how we use the environment in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A recent article in ‘The Irish Times’
                said</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">

                breathtaking. Fields are edged with dry boulder walls and uneven
                with velvet pockets and rounded hummocks&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a beautiful, idyllic setting. The
                article describes the outstanding qualities of one of Northern
                Ireland’s greatest national assets — the Mournes — which
                requires proper management for use by future generations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must never forget that people with varying
                interests not only live in the Mourne region and its surrounding
                settlements but eke out, in many different ways, an existence
                from the land and sea. There has been some diversification, but
                that has not filled the gap. Such diversification was the basis
                of European funding and I am concerned about the continuity of
                that funding. We must find a way to bridge the gap between the
                completion of the last tranche, on 31 December 1999, and the
                commencement of the funding for the next six-year period, which
                will not be available until spring. I hope that the Government
                will act swiftly to bridge that gap.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need a management plan for all who live
                and work in the Mournes and for those who visit as holidaymakers
                — there is no doubt about that. The plan needs to satisfy a
                range of interests: farmers, fishermen, small industrialists,
                commercial concerns, rural dwellers, tourists and day-trippers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Who is responsible for the implementation of
                such a plan? Now that political authority has been devolved to
                the Executive, it is we. Acting in unison, we should ensure that
                a proper management plan for the Mournes is devised. The plan
                already exists; it was devised by the Mourne Heritage Trust.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has been endorsed by three district
                councils — Down, Newry and Mourne and Banbridge — as well as
                the 60 community groups that make up an organisation known as
                the Regeneration of the Mournes Ltd. Surely this reflects an
                acceptable level of community involvement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This management plan was devised under direct
                rule. The Ministers at that time took the easy option and
                side-stepped the issue on the basis that the enhanced management
                structures proposed would involve resourcing, so, theoretically,
                they left it for the devolved Assembly to deal with.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Previous political Administrations relied on
                the protected areas designation and other protective
                notifications. However, there has not been a single focus on how
                to develop what I have described as a national asset for
                Northern Ireland. The whole thing illustrates the cop-out that
                was taken by previous administrations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The gains to be had from the implementation
                of a properly structured, properly resourced, co-ordinated and
                cohesive management plan would outweigh all the disadvantages.
                The only disadvantage that I can discover from all the
                correspondence and the meetings with various Departments is the
                question of cost. However, by adopting a more sensible approach
                to that plan, the costs involved would be returned manyfold.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Mourne Heritage Trust reckons that for
                every £1 that is spent £4 has been returned in investment and
                better resources for the area, and economic regeneration
                involvement has increased. That is a 400% return on investment,
                and the potential is even greater; we should remember that. A
                PricewaterhouseCoopers report was published in respect of the
                Canadian national parks programmes, and it showed that for every
                dollar invested, $9 was generated for the local and regional
                economies. This seems to apply in many other areas also.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am very pleased that the Mourne Heritage
                Trust has been able to devise and develop this plan. They
                recently made an excellent presentation to the Minister of the
                Environment, and I thank the Department for receiving the
                delegation so sympathetically. If there is a problem with money
                eventually, we will discuss this as well. I have received an
                assurance from the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment
                that he would like to hear a similar presentation, and I hope
                that the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development will
                follow suit.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This exemplifies the cross-cutting
                interdepartmental nature of what should be our new programme,
                about which we heard so much in this morning’s debate. An
                interdepartmental approach to the future management of the
                Mournes is urgently required, and the impetus for this can be
                provided only by the new political institutions here — through
                the Executive, aided by the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The central feature of such a management plan
                is the concept of a national park. In this instance the national
                park concept has been changed, ameliorated and devised to cater
                for the local situation. It is known throughout the isles as the
                Celtic Model Park. This has been devised for the Mourne area,
                and, if successful, it will be a model for many other areas in
                Ireland. The principle designation of national park status in
                Northern Ireland emerged in the original ad hoc management
                committee of the Mournes, known as the Mournes Advisory Council
                and was noted in the draft regional strategic framework document
                ‘Shaping our Future’.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This document provides a framework for both
                rural and urban planning requirements for the next 25 years. It
                is important to get in on this on the ground floor and get our
                act right. The Mourne Heritage Trust is satisfied that this
                Celtic model of national park status may be a solution for
                Northern Ireland, providing consensus for the future management
                and development of the Mourne area in a way which would add
                considerably to Northern Ireland’s overall environment and
                tourism products.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main components of Celtic national park
                status are as follows. The existing Mourne Heritage Trust would
                continue to exercise its management function. The Department of
                the Environment would retain the planning powers — which make
                central government jittery sometimes — for the Mournes. As
                socio-economic and nature conservation programmes go hand in
                hand, these would be play an equal role, and in fact, that role
                is already devised. The three district councils would still be
                the access authorities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the park is fully operational, it will
                require core funding estimated at £1·2 million per annum. I
                understand that the core cost is presently £200,000, so we are
                talking about an estimated additional £1 million. It sounds
                like a great deal of money, but, as I mentioned earlier, the
                clawback for the regional and local economy may be four times,
                or — if the Canadian experience is repeated — nine times the
                sum invested. The three district councils and the Craigavon and
                Downpatrick planning divisions currently provide the local
                governance of the Mournes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What exactly is the Mourne area? It is not
                just the Mourne Mountains. When you refer to the Mournes, people
                think of the mountains and the song about them sweeping down to
                the sea. I want to give you some physical statistics. The area
                consists of 29,000 hectares of farmland; 1,500 farms with a
                small average of 20 hectares; 20,000 hectares of moorlands and
                mountains; 5,000 hectares of woodlands and forests; 72 km of
                coastline; and a series of rivers, lakes and reservoirs. This is
                one of the greatest natural resources in the island of Ireland,
                North or South. We are not paying enough attention to its
                potential for development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition to the natural physical features,
                there are 350 historic monuments; two sustained village
                conservation areas; 400 listed buildings; and 1,700 derelict
                vernacular buildings, which could be restored and used for
                economic purposes. Those are some of the characteristics that
                translate the picture-postcard image of the Mournes into a
                reality which is available for development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why should the Mournes be designated with
                national park status? It is happening elsewhere, and unless it
                is dealt with urgently, we will be left lagging behind. There
                are eight parks in England already, two of which are being
                proposed for management. There are three national parks in Wales
                and two new national parks being created in Scotland. Northern
                Ireland is probably the only country in the EU which does not
                have a national park. That speaks for itself. National parks —
                whose features lend themselves so well to departmental
                cross-cutting — rejuvenate, yet sustain both the natural and
                human environment. Therefore we need to examine it quickly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although the existing management is doing an
                excellent job and making considerable progress, because it is
                under-resourced things tend to happen in a piecemeal fashion at
                present. Indeed, it lacks effective power to carry out many of
                its duties, remembering always that the local population
                consensus is totally behind it.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are competing pressures on all such
                beautiful areas between landowners, developers, tourist
                interests, farmers, rural dwellers and, in this case, fishermen.
                They all demand a better-resourced co-ordinated effective
                management plan for the Mournes. National park designation would
                confer the special status that is required. A local body capable
                of managing such a park already exists in the form of the
                Mournes Heritage Trust, which is recognised by the Departments.
                The Government policy context is supportive through the future
                strategic planning strategy. The Northern Ireland Tourist Board
                policy that underpins sustainable and cultural tourism is also
                on board.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Environment and Heritage Service, which
                supports biodiversity and wishes to ensure access to such areas,
                is also in favour of it. The economic and tourist development
                strategies of the three district councils, European Union
                environmental policy and the rural development plan submitted by
                the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development to Brussels
                for European Commission approval all support the key theme of
                rural regeneration and development through funding for
                environmentally sensitive areas. Not only is this an
                environmentally sensitive area, but it is one of the largest
                less-favoured areas in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For all of these reasons, it is both good
                common sense and a good practical use of our natural resource,
                and also a requirement to provide a continuing custody of that
                area, as well as ensuring the economic well-being of the people
                who live there.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Financing still remains both an objective and
                an obstacle. I believe that it is an obstacle that the Celtic
                model of National Park status could overcome with the figures
                that I have given you. The return on investment, pound for
                pound, is one of the best deals that one can get. It is much
                better than stocks and shares or investing in the open market.
                It may not be apparently returnable in terms of a pound coming
                out of the Department and four pounds going back into the
                Department — that is not what happens. But it means that there
                is that 400% or 900% renewal in the local and regional economy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Much of the Mournes is already designated as
                an area of special control. These areas of special control are
                important, but piecemeal. They have different designations:
                areas of outstanding natural beauty, areas of special scientific
                interest and a plethora of other mnemonics. We need a holistic
                approach to bring all these together along with the human
                element — the resources and requirements of the people who
                live and work in the Mournes — and give them an economic
                future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not want to pre-empt the ministerial
                response, but I think the system of management that is proposed
                has the approval — not in writing, but certainly in spirit —
                of the Department. It is a very interesting and viable practical
                approach to preserving, developing, using and making profitable
                that natural resource. The only thing wrong is the hesitancy and
                reluctance to give it the initial financing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Legislatively, it would be a very simple
                matter. It would only require an Order, in consultation with the
                public and the proposed managers, to have it translated from its
                present status of management to that of a national park. It
                would bring Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the UK
                and the European Union in terms of national parks with respect
                to the environment, tourism, the local and regional economy and
                the local community who live and work there.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I strongly recommend that we take the new
                initiative to create the specialised tailor-made national park
                concept known — in the circles that deal with these matters
                — as the Celtic model, and try to develop it immediately in
                the Mournes. There will undoubtedly be a resource problem, but
                the Department of the Environment, the Department of Enterprise,
                Trade and Industry and the Department of Agriculture and Rural
                Development should encourage the proposal.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The £1 million should not have to come from
                the Department of the Environment alone. There should be greater
                interdepartmental involvement. If the cost were split between
                three or four Departments, each would only have to pay £250,000
                a year. That investment would have a great return.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, I am sure that a reasonable case
                could be made for resources from Europe, particularly from the
                Rural Development Fund. If there is willingness, acceptance and
                drive, the money can be found on a cross-departmental basis. The
                total burden should not fall on one Department.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us implement the Mournes concept as a
                pilot scheme. I am sure it will be extremely successful and will
                provide an enormous boost to the local economy and to the people
                who work and live in the area. The primary purpose is to open up
                the area for the tourist influx we are anticipating under the
                new peace regime while sustaining and protecting that national
                asset we are selling to tourists. It is important that we
                achieve a balance between the people who live in the area,
                tourists and day visitors who come to enjoy the area and the
                environment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The plan that the Mournes Heritage Trust has
                presented to the Department of the Environment — and which it
                will present to other Departments in the next couple of weeks
                – is the most professional management plan that I have seen
                for a long time. I have great confidence that if the trust is
                given enough encouragement, it will be able to set up Northern
                Ireland’s first national park. Once that has been shown to be
                successful and economically productive, the idea can be extended
                to other areas of Northern Ireland, which have different but
                equally valuable natural assets to develop for tourism.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While the Assembly cannot vote on this
                matter, it is hoped that the participation and effort of
                individual Members inside and outside the Chamber will drive
                Departments to work together to acquire the modest resources
                that are needed. Funding is the only obstacle. I have not yet
                heard any arguments against the concept or the detail of the
                plan.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I cannot help but compare the position to
                that of the Department of Education on the issue of museums,
                when it said that it did not have the necessary resources, so
                there was no point in formulating policy. The Department
                continued to say that for 10 years, which was a disastrous way
                to proceed. These policies should be adopted and the money
                obtained from somebody’s pocket, be it ours or someone from
                Europe.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recommend to the Assembly the unique
                concept of a Celtic national park that initially will apply to
                the Mournes and then be extrapolated to other areas.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wells:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support almost everything the hon Member
                has said. I want to query only one issue in his entire
                contribution. We agree, as would Mr&nbsp;Bradley, that we are
                privileged to represent what is without doubt the most scenic
                constituency in Northern&nbsp;Ireland. I have had the occasional
                debate with my party leader on that issue, but in terms of
                overall scenic quality, nothing compares with South&nbsp;Down.
                Most of the constituency comprises the Mournes area of
                outstanding natural beauty. Walking in the Mournes is one of my
                pleasures, and I recall some wonderful sunny days walking up the
                Brandy Pad and the Annalong Valley and climbing Lower&nbsp;Cove
                or Ben&nbsp;Crom — some of the most wonderful peaks in the
                Mournes. I adore the area. I am a former member of the Mournes
                Advisory Council and a current member of Friends of the Mournes.
                Like Mr McGrady, I am absolutely committed to its protection.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the Mournes region were in any other part
                of the world, it would be a national park. When conservationists
                visit Northern&nbsp;Ireland and ask where our national parks
                are, they are astounded when we guiltily admit that we do not
                have any. It is extraordinary. Even more extraordinary is the
                fact that the legislation to establish national parks in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland has been in place for 35&nbsp;years. The
                enabling legislation is the Amenity Lands Act
                (Northern&nbsp;Ireland) 1965, which was replicated in the Nature
                Conservation and Amenity Lands (Northern&nbsp;Ireland) Order
                1985. This is not even a matter of legislation: the Assembly has
                the power to establish national parks.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The idea of national parks was followed up in
                1965, and a civil servant was sent out to Fermanagh to test the
                reaction. I heard a rather amusing story about that. Many
                farmers disagreed with the idea because they felt that national
                parks were parks for Nationalists. Needless to say, that
                suggestion was erroneous. National parks were not for
                Nationalists, but for the entire community. However, some of the
                farming community became confused about what national parks
                meant and there was some opposition to them. The idea was gently
                shelved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, national parks were debated at great
                length during consultations on the Nature Conservation and
                Amenity Lands (Northern&nbsp;Ireland) Order 1985 and I remember
                that there was a tremendous push to establish a structure that
                would enable the effective management of our areas of great
                scenic quality. Sadly, nothing happened.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Here we are, 15 years later, and still there
                is no structure in place. That is not to decry the excellent
                work done by the Mournes Heritage Trust and its predecessor, the
                Mournes Advisory Council, or the district councils and all the
                community groups involved with managing the Mournes. However, we
                do not yet have the overarching structure to provide adequate
                management for the Mournes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members may think that the Mournes is an
                attractive area, but it is under enormous pressure such as that
                which is undoubtedly caused by intense recreational use. The
                large number of walkers causes serious erosion. Sometimes there
                is overgrazing although, ironically, the ban on sheep grazing
                caused by the outbreak of cryptosporidium may take us to the
                other extreme. There may not be enough grazing in the Mournes,
                and the nature conservation value of the area may decline
                because there would not be sufficient grazing to maintain the
                quality of the area’s flora.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is unsympathetic development in the
                Mournes. Many farmers are under such enormous economic pressures
                that they have been forced to try to obtain planning permission
                for bungalows for as many sites as possible. Some bungalows are
                well designed and are in keeping with the Mournes landscape, but
                others are not. The pressure on the planners is becoming greater
                as they are being pushed to give planning permission, thereby
                providing farmers with income. That will only lead to further
                unsympathetic development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am very concerned about the impact of the
                landfill tax. It is a good concept, but it has led to the
                filling in of a lot of small wetlands in the Mournes area with
                inert hardcore infill. Developers and waste disposal operators
                do not want to pay landfill tax, which they would have to if
                they took waste to a registered site. Therefore it is tempting
                to open up the hedge and cover a small wetland with rubble. The
                result is that such areas are completely destroyed from the
                nature conservation perspective.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are many pressures, but perhaps the
                most notable at present is the drastic decline in farming
                incomes in the Mournes. Like the rest of Northern&nbsp;Ireland,
                farmers in the Mournes have faced an incredible reduction in
                their net incomes of at least 90%.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">7.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most farmers in the Mournes are running at a
                loss. Many of them are at the edge of viability anyhow. The 90%
                fall in incomes, combined with the impact of the sheep-grazing
                ban, is going to have a devastating effect on those communities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The only hope for the long-term sustainable
                future of the Mournes is some form of eco-tourism, which does
                not lead to the reduction of the ecological value of the area.
                The difficulty is that there are a whole series of government
                bodies, district councils and quangos, each of which has
                responsibility for a bit of the Mournes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Rivers Agency is responsible for
                drainage. Environment and Heritage Service is responsible for
                the areas of special scientific interest, the area of
                outstanding natural beauty and the designation of nature
                reserves. The Department of Agriculture and Regional Development
                is responsible for the implementation of the environmentally
                sensitive area and less-favoured area schemes. The Northern
                Ireland Tourist Board is involved in the promotion of the area
                to incoming visitors. There is no body, scheme or system that
                enables holistic, coherent policy implementation to be brought
                in and activated in the Mournes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I believe that a model is needed. It may not
                be exactly like a national park; I agree with the hon Member
                that an adapted version might be appropriate. We might argue
                about the phrase &quot;the celtic model&quot;, but I know why it
                is called that, and I know it is not an attempt to make a
                political point. I would prefer to call it the Ulster model or
                the Northern Ireland Model, but we will not argue over
                semantics. We need to have some structure that can deliver what
                the Mournes so seriously need.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All we really need is £1·2 million. That
                sounds like a lot of money, but we all welcomed the substantial
                increase in funding that the Department secured in the Budget
                statement. That is long overdue. There may well be sufficient
                funds within that increased budget, in conjunction with other
                Departments, to enable a proportion to be allocated to the
                Mournes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are not talking about an awful lot of
                money; we are talking about 80p per annum for every man, woman
                and child in this Province. Is that too much to spend on the
                maintenance of what is clearly one of our most scenic areas? I
                see enormous benefits in a proposal to have some form of
                management structure for the Mournes, in terms of both the
                economic well-being of the area and the protection of the
                environment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The lesson has been learned throughout the
                rest of the United Kingdom and — dare I say it? — in the
                Irish Republic, where four national parks have been designated.
                It has been clearly shown that there have been enormous economic
                benefits from the designation and the management, as well as the
                protection of the environment. I believe that if we go forward
                with this proposal and give the Department the support that it
                needs to implement it, it could be used as a best example that
                could be duplicated elsewhere.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are very fortunate in Northern Ireland to
                have some of the most outstanding areas of natural beauty in the
                United Kingdom. The north Antrim coast, the Glens, Fermanagh,
                the Sperrins, and what I feel to be one of the most underrated
                areas of all, Benevenagh in north Londonderry. They are all
                outstanding areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we get it right in the Mournes, we can go
                forward to implement a similar structure throughout the
                Province. My final point is that where we score, as far as the
                Mournes are concerned, is that a huge proportion of the central
                part of the Mournes is Government- owned. It is owned by the
                Department for Regional Development. Therefore there is some
                direct departmental control over it, and we can implement
                policies much more easily in that situation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we develop a structure that is suitable
                for Northern Ireland and take it out to the farming community
                and the district councils, I am sure we will get their support,
                particularly if we can show the leverage effect. The economic
                benefits that will accrue from that will bring real sustainable
                employment to the Mournes as well as protection.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The situation in the agricultural community
                is so stark at the moment that anything that can be offered to
                bring about genuine increases in their incomes will be more than
                welcome. I see enormous merit in what Mr McGrady is suggesting.
                I can assure him that we can provide cross-community support for
                these suggestions. Throughout the Mourne community, all sections
                of the community will say that this is an idea whose time has
                come. Let us go forward together and do something very positive
                for that community.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McNamee:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.
                The brevity of the title of the Adjournment debate gives a lot
                of scope as to what we talk about regarding the future of the
                Mournes, whether we are talking about its geographical,
                ecological or environmental features, its communities, or its
                economy. What is going to have a major impact on all of these is
                the area plan that will govern the Mournes. Part of that plan
                will be determined by Newry and Mourne District Council and, no
                doubt, by Down District Council.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In order to sustain any area, you have to
                sustain the communities that live in it. The Mournes is a
                largely rural area, and it is difficult for people who live in
                it to build homes. People who come from farming backgrounds and
                whose ancestors have worked the land are finding it increasingly
                difficult to acquire planning permission to build houses and to
                live on their own family farm. I acknowledge the need for
                control of the development of housing in rural areas,
                particularly in an area of outstanding natural beauty such as
                the Mournes, but the pressure and restrictions on planning
                permissions has increased the value and the scarcity of sites.
                Certainly in the Newry and Mourne district prices have increased
                by more than 200%, in some cases in as short a period as two
                years. This means that young people who are indigenous to rural
                areas such as the Mournes simply can not afford to buy property.
                The net result is that younger people are moving out of their
                rural communities and into towns and cities while better-off
                people, who are wealthy enough to purchase the sites, are moving
                in. So there is a breakdown in terms of the rural community
                itself. The area plan, which is under consultation, needs to
                take on board the issue of future housing provision in rural
                areas. There needs to be a preference towards the indigenous
                population. At the same time the rural environment must be
                protected.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Mourne Mountains have a largely unspoiled
                natural beauty. I often hear people talking about Killarney,
                Wicklow, Connemara, north Antrim, the Giant’s Causeway and
                Mayo, but anyone who sings the praises of those places, without
                visiting the Mournes, should take a hike —a hike along the
                Trassey track, up through Hare’s Gap, round the Brandy Pad,
                over the side of Slieve Donard and down into Newcastle. It took
                me quite some time to walk through it, and I must say I have not
                met any other Assembly Members during my visits there. However,
                there is no doubt that it is an area of outstanding natural
                beauty that is practically unknown in Ireland, let alone in
                other places. It has a tremendous tourism potential, but it
                needs better road and transport infrastructure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another element is the proposal building of a
                road bridge link at Narrow Water, connecting the Carlingford
                peninsula and Warrenpoint and leading to the Mournes. This would
                have a major impact on linking up tourist routes in the South
                and that would work both ways. The Mournes must be given
                consideration. The link would open up a tourist avenue that
                would benefit both sides of Carlingford Lough. Not only would it
                help to advance tourism, it would also be a strategic transport
                link for the economic development of the Mournes area in
                general.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the main economic assets in the
                Mournes area is the port of Warrenpoint. Any future development
                is restricted because of the traffic congestion in Newry.
                Traffic from the north must travel through Newry to reach
                Warrenpoint. Many heavy goods vehicles, whether coming from the
                North or the South, travel through Newry to reach Warrenpoint.
                The construction of a road bridge link at Narrow Water would
                open up the potential for a future road link with the
                Dublin-Belfast route south of Newry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As well as promoting tourism, this could
                further promote the economy. As a large rural area, the Mournes
                depends heavily on agriculture. I will not rehash previous
                Assembly discussions about the crises affecting farmers, not
                just in the Mournes but also in other areas, issues including
                BSE, the pig industry and the price of sheep. Giving sheep away
                was almost more economical than keeping them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The area plans must also consider the future
                of the Mournes. It is crucial to focus on giving farmers leeway
                in matters such as farm diversification. In rural areas like the
                Mournes, planning restriction can prevent farm diversification
                because farmers do not get the necessary permission for such
                developments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Traditional farming in the Mournes and in
                many rural areas throughout Ireland maintains the nature of our
                countryside. Overgrazing and undergrazing have just been
                mentioned. We must consider the future if farmers abandon land
                in the Mournes and the surrounding area. We do sometimes not
                recognise the non-remunerative work that farmers do in
                preserving the very nature of rural Ireland. Generations of
                farmers have given us the environment that we now have. Farming
                is currently not economically viable, and some farmers are being
                forced to leave the land. Eventually, the nature of rural
                Ireland as we know it may disappear, and disappear at a great
                cost.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today the Programme for Government was
                launched. I hope that the specifics of the final draft and of
                the next Budget will give due weight to the need to support the
                agriculture industry. I am not only concerned about the effects
                on the agricultural and rural communities, but also about the
                long-term effect on the rural nature of the environment as we
                know it in Ireland, and particularly in the Mournes. If the
                economic future of the Mournes is to be viable, the plan for
                that area must address the potential of a road bridge link at
                Narrow Water. If we are to secure the environmental future of
                the Mournes we must address the crisis in farming. If we are to
                safeguard the future of rural and agricultural communities, the
                area plan must take into consideration the issues which I raised
                about the strategic planning framework for the Mournes area. Go

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Bradley, may I remind you that our time is
                limited to one hour? I would like to give the Minister an
                opportunity to respond.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Bradley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is easy for us all to identify with
                national parks. If we are lucky enough to go on foreign travel,
                the first thing a lot of us look for is a brochure to identify
                the national parks. They are undoubtedly an asset, and if we
                have one in our own area, so much the better. Coming from a
                council background, I am tempted to look at the detrimental
                effects, and it is easy to envisage it just as a planning issue.
                In his presentation, Eddie McGrady used words such as
                &quot;consultation&quot; and &quot;balance&quot;. If this
                national park materialises, its proper implementation will
                derive from those factors.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In my maiden speech in the Assembly, I
                referred to the problems that authentic applicants in the
                Mournes were experiencing with planning permission. The
                administration of the national park concept could include proper
                legislation allowing for those people to be considered.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Great hopes for rural Northern Ireland were
                expressed in this morning’s programme for Government. The
                rural population of our villages and townlands will be catered
                for at both higher education level and on the farm. We thought
                young farmers might leave their farms in the future. If the
                Government encouraged them to stay at home, it would step up
                demand for additional housing. Who would choose to be a Minister
                at this stage, trying to achieve such an intricate balance? The
                area plan contains proposals to look at our hamlets and the
                closes. The very old maps of the Mournes show many addresses as
                closes. In my area I can think of Magee’s Close, Fagan’s
                Close, O’Hagan’s Close — all clusters of four to six
                houses. If we decide to regenerate in the future, our plans must
                accommodate the people who will carry out the regeneration.
                Perhaps the Minister will examine the idea of hamlets and closes
                to see how they could be facilitated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the benefits of a national park are
                properly harnessed, everyone will be the better for it — the
                indigenous population, their offspring for generations to come,
                and tourists and visitors. I will conclude with Eddie McGrady’s
                two words &quot;consultation&quot; and &quot;balance&quot;. We
                need to get those things right.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of the Environment (Mr Foster):</b>
                I commend Mr McGrady and the other Members who have taken part.
                They seem to have a great love for the Mournes, and that is very
                commendable. They have presented a good case, but it is wrong to
                suggest that others have no interest in the Mournes. Different
                groupings have great interest in the Mournes, and I will expand
                on that shortly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are differing reactions across the
                Province, so such issues can be difficult. I come from
                Fermanagh, where the council members were frightened of having
                designations in case they would inhibit planning in their area.
                Members, and Mr McGrady in particular, have raised issues
                relating to the management of the Mournes and the well-being of
                the people who live there. I agree with the importance of
                integrated management, and this can be achieved through the
                present arrangements. An example is the joint approach by the
                Departments and the Mourne Heritage Trust, which I will refer to
                later. I will summarise the general background.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Mourne Mountains, and the farmed
                landscape and coastline that surround them, are important to the
                people of Northern Ireland and particularly to the people who
                live near them. They are important environmentally, economically
                and culturally. My Department has recognised this by designating
                the Mournes/Slieve Croob area as an area of outstanding natural
                beauty on account of the landscape value and the recreational
                value of this beautiful area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Nature Conservation and Amenity Lands
                (Northern Ireland) Order 1985 allows the Department to take
                measures for the management of such areas and to promote their
                enjoyment by the public. The Mournes were the first area
                designated under that legislation, and since 1984 — even
                before the designation — the Department has committed staff
                and resources to tasks associated with environmental management
                and recreation in the area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In recent years we have become increasingly
                aware of the changing nature of the management of special
                landscapes throughout Europe and particularly in the United
                Kingdom. In all such areas it has become fundamentally important
                not only to facilitate proper sustainable management and public
                enjoyment, but also to do so in ways that involve and empower
                local communities. It is very important to involve local
                communities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sustainable use for tourism and recreation
                brings benefits to the local economy, particularly at a time
                when traditional agriculture is under great pressure. With this
                in mind, my Department took the lead in establishing the Mourne
                Heritage Trust. We have subsequently been the main funders of
                the body, providing almost half its running costs. I welcome the
                additional support that has been given by the Northern Ireland
                Tourist Board, the Department of Agriculture and Rural
                Development and the three district councils in the area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is wrong to say that the area is being
                ignored — it is not; we think about it very much. The trust
                and its performance over the first three years of its life are
                currently the subject of an evaluation by consultants. While
                this review is not yet complete, I can tell Members that it has
                shown the trust to have been effective in raising the profile of
                local environmental issues and in delivering an area-based
                strategy for the Department of Agriculture and Rural
                Development. However, the review has also identified several
                issues that must now be addressed. The trust should address some
                of these, such as the need to work more directly on habitat
                creation and nature conservation issues. Other issues have wider
                implications that will need to be addressed in due course not
                only by my Department, but by other Departments and by the
                Assembly. I refer to matters such as the adequate resourcing of
                the trust for a continuing and increasing rural regeneration
                role, and the issue of matching funding being made available for
                larger projects.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Such issues also impinge on the consideration
                of national park status. National parks in England and Wales,
                and more recently in Scotland, have undergone the evolution to
                which I referred earlier. They have moved from a largely
                conservation agenda to one of the sustainable use of the
                environment — a process involving, and benefiting, local
                people. Such parks are well funded by subvention grants from the
                exchequer. The detail of the recently announced national parks
                for Scotland is not yet known. However, the national parks in
                England and Wales have a constitution, board membership and
                operational powers, including planning. These are all approved
                by Parliament.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important for the Assembly to consider
                what is right and appropriate on such matters as they relate
                specifically to Northern Ireland. The idea of declaring the
                Mournes a national park, however deserving of that status they
                may be, cannot be implemented without full and proper
                consideration of the implications. Resourcing, mandate and
                detailed operational matters all have to be closely considered.
                To do otherwise would be unwise and very much premature.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In considering a form of national park
                designation for the Mournes, we need to examine the implications
                for other areas. We also need to assess the capacity of the
                infrastructure to handle extra visitors, and to look in detail
                at any management arrangements and the resulting resource
                implications.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recently met Mr McGrady and officers of the
                Mourne Heritage Trust to consider the national park issue. There
                is no doubt that there are arguments in favour, subject to what
                I have said about full and proper consideration. As a result, I
                have asked my Department to consider this issue and the
                designation of the remaining Areas of Outstanding Natural
                Beauty, bearing in mind the fact that this programme is only
                half complete. My officials will report to me as soon as
                possible. I will, of course, consult widely on any proposals I
                decide to put forward.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">None of this detracts from the value and
                importance of the Mournes and the need to sustain that
                environment and its communities. The Mourne Heritage Trust has
                provided very valuable and effective help in this regard. I
                certainly intend that my Department should continue to support
                such activities by the trust at a level appropriate to our
                resources.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The complexity of rural issues and the fact
                that these come within the remit of a number of Departments
                requires close co-ordination between Ministers and between their
                officials. This is happening, and work is under way to devise
                programmes for the next round of EU funding, notably the
                national resource rural tourism programme led by the Department
                for Agriculture and Rural Development. The Mournes, along with
