		    <p class="H2DocumentDate">Tuesday 8 May 2007</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The Assembly met at 10.30 am (Madam Speaker in the  Chair).</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
		    <p class="H3SectionHeading">The Late Mr George Dawson mla</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  It is my sad duty to inform the House of the death of Mr George Dawson, a  Member for the East Antrim constituency. In  accordance with convention, as a mark of respect for Mr Dawson, the sitting  will now be suspended until 11.00 am.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The sitting was suspended at 10.33 am.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">On resuming (Madam Speaker in the Chair) &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">11.00 am</p>
		    <p class="H3SectionHeading" style="margin-top:19.85pt;">Assembly Business</p>
		    <p class="H4StageHeading" style="margin-top:0cm;">Restoration Order</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  In a letter dated 7 May 2007, the Secretary of State has notified me that he  has made a restoration order under section 2(2) of the Northern Ireland (St Andrews  Agreement) Act 2006. The restoration order lifts the suspension of the Northern  Ireland Assembly and effects the restoration of devolved Government in Northern Ireland  today.</p>
		    <p class="H3SectionHeading" style="margin-top:19.85pt;">Speaker&rsquo;s Business</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  I am mindful of the importance of today&rsquo;s proceedings, the level of interest in  our business today, and the widespread goodwill being expressed towards our  restored Assembly, both within and beyond our community. That goodwill is  evidenced by the large presence in the Gallery of members of the public and  guests, including some who have travelled from London,  Dublin and the United States of America. On behalf  of the Assembly, I welcome all our guests today and thank them for their  interest and support, past and present.</p>
		    <p class="H3SectionHeading" style="margin-top:19.85pt;">Assembly Business</p>
		    <p class="H4StageHeading" style="margin-top:0cm;">Roll of Membership</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  Since we last met, the Secretary of State has amended the Standing Orders for  the Transitional Assembly that relate to signing the Roll of Membership. Mr  Trevor Lunn has since signed the Roll of Membership in my presence and that of  the Clerk to the Assembly. I am satisfied that he has taken <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt; ">his seat in accordance with the amended Standing  Orders</span>. I have deemed Mr Lunn&rsquo;s designation to be &ldquo;Other&rdquo;.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText"><span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; ">In accordance with the  legislation, all Members have</span> now  taken their seats in the Northern Ireland Assembly.</p>
		    <p class="H4StageHeading">Standing Orders</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  Members will be aware that the Secretary of State prepared draft Standing  Orders. In accordance with the legislation, those have today become the  Standing Orders of the Northern Ireland Assembly. Each Member has been provided  with a personal copy.</p>
		    <p class="H3SectionHeading">Election Of Speaker</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  Under the legislation, I became Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly this  morning. However, I do believe that it is important that the Assembly should have an early  opportunity to elect a Speaker from among its Members.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I remind Members that the election of the Speaker will be  conducted using the procedures set out in Standing Order 4, as follows.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I will begin by asking for nominations. Any Member may rise  to propose that another Member be elected as Speaker. I will then ask for the  proposal to be seconded by another Member, as required by Standing Order 14. If  that occurs, I will then verify that the Member so nominated is willing to  accept the nomination. There will not be an opportunity for speeches at that  stage.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I shall then ask for further proposals and follow the same  procedure for each. When it appears that there are no further proposals, I will  make it clear that the time for proposals has passed. A debate relevant to the  election may then take place, in which no Member shall speak more than once.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">At the conclusion of the debate, or at the conclusion of  the nominations if there are no requests to speak, I shall put the Question  that the Member first proposed shall be Speaker of this Assembly. Such a vote  can be carried only on a cross-community basis. If the proposal is not carried,  I shall put the Question in relation to the next nominee, and so on, until all  nominations are exhausted. Once a Speaker is elected, all other nominations  will automatically fall.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">If that is clear, we shall proceed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Do I have any proposals for the office of Speaker of this  Assembly?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Ian  Paisley</strong>: Madam Speaker, we appreciate <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; ">all  that you have done in presiding over our Assemblies</span>. As you look down at  these Benches, you will have some peculiar thoughts. Perhaps some day we will  be privileged to read what you thought of the people that you looked upon so  carefully and affectionately. You had a difficult time, and it was a difficult  time for the Assembly. Nevertheless, you kept a grip on business, with the  necessary leniency; yet you kept aright the standards  of debate. We are grateful to you for that. You can look ahead with no doubt that you did well, because you never  had to order any Member out of the House.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Adams</strong>: Ba mhaith liom mo bhu&iacute;ochas a thabhairt duit. You did a  wonderful job, and I join Dr Paisley in  thanking you for being very fair in conducting business here.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">T&aacute; m&eacute; an-s&aacute;sta go bhfuil t&uacute; anseo ag t&uacute;s an r&eacute; nua. <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt; ">Furthermore, I am very pleased that you are here  to see a</span> new start. I wish you, your  husband and your family well.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Ba mhaith liom a r&aacute; fosta go bhfuil m&eacute; an-bhr&oacute;nach faoi  bh&aacute;s George Dawson, agus d&eacute;anaim comhbhr&oacute;n lena theaghlach agus lena ph&aacute;irt&iacute;. I  am sorry to hear of the untimely death of George Dawson, and Sinn F&eacute;in extends  to his wife and family, his party and party leader its condolences.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Sir Reg Empey</strong>:  Madam Speaker, on behalf of the Ulster Unionist Party, I join with other  Members in thanking you for your courtesy and the manner in which you have  conducted our business over some very difficult times. At every occasion you  extended every courtesy to us, and, as other Members have said, I know how  difficult we can be at times. At all times you kept a sense of humour and  occasion, and we are grateful to you for carrying on well beyond the point at  which you could easily have relieved yourself of the burden of office.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Like the previous Member, I place on record the UUP&rsquo;s deep  regret at the very sad news of the death of one of our Members, George Dawson,  which overshadows today&rsquo;s proceedings. To his family, and colleagues in the Democratic Unionist Party, we  extend our deepest sympathies.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  Madam Speaker, on behalf of the SDLP, I join with the leaders of other parties  in thanking you for your contribution in the office of Speaker. You have  displayed courtesy, good character and not a little charm during something of a  political twilight zone in which we operated during the past few months. Prior  to that, you made a very distinctive contribution in the Assembly. You leave with  our thanks &mdash; not only for your role as  Speaker but for your contribution as a fellow Member of the Assembly.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I, too, extend sympathy to the Dawson family, George&rsquo;s friends and his party colleagues on his untimely death.  George had a very distinctive economic insight, and the new Assembly, on this  important day, will be the poorer for his absence.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  echo the comments made about the passing of George Dawson. On behalf of my  party and all my colleagues, I express sympathy to Mrs Dawson, his party colleagues  and to the wider family circle. As Mark Durkan has just said, during last  summer he made an enormous contribution in the Preparation for Government  Committee in preparing the ground for the economic work to be done. We will at  least have his legacy in that respect.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I echo the sentiments of  other Members in expressing thanks to Madam Speaker Bell. I may have  worked rather longer with Eileen Bell than have others, but on this occasion I,  and my colleagues, want to thank you for what you did. It was a thankless task  to preside over the Transitional Assembly.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It was not only Members in this Chamber who gave you problems at times; you were presented with  problems from a wide range of circumstances. However, you dealt with  them all with good humour and your customary courtesy and charm. You ensured  that everything that could be done to defend the integrity of this Assembly was  done. Madam Speaker, on behalf of my group, I thank you, and the staff who  worked with you, for all that you have achieved, and I wish you and Derek well  in the years ahead.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Ian  Paisley</strong>: I assure the Members and the leaders of the various parties who  have expressed their sympathy to the Dawson  family that I will convey those sentiments to Mr Dawson&rsquo;s wife and his two  daughters. I am grateful to the party leaders and all our colleagues here for  their kindness and understanding at this time.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Purvis</strong>:  On behalf of the Progressive Unionist Party,  I wish to express our condolences on the death of George Dawson and extend our sympathies to his  family.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Madam Speaker, there were times when it has been difficult  for you over the last couple of years, but you embraced your role with your  usual enthusiasm and courage. On behalf of our party, I thank you, and I wish  you well in your retirement. I know that you will indulge all your many  passions, including fashion, golf, and so on. I wish you well for your  retirement.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  Thank you.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Do I have any proposals for the office of Speaker of this  Assembly?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Ian  Paisley</strong>: I would like to propose Mr William Hay. It gives me very great  pleasure to nominate Mr Hay from the Foyle constituency to be the first elected  Speaker of the Assembly.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is fitting to say some brief words about him. I have  known the Hay family for far too long to want to remember how long ago I met  him &mdash; he was a young boy in short pants at that time. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span> He came to prominence through his mother, Anna Margaret Hay, who was the first  ever DUP elected representative in County   Londonderry. This is a  proud day for the Hay family, and it honours the memory of their mother.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">At the last election, William performed the remarkable feat of topping the poll in an  overwhelmingly nationalist constituency &mdash; with all due respect to my  Friend, the leader of the SDLP. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span> It is not  often that that happens. William is well regarded by unionists and  non-unionists, and I welcome the opportunity to put him forward. I acknowledge  that at the next Assembly election, we will  support a candidate drawn from the other side of the House. Of course,  that will rest with the people because we will go back to the people for new  mandates. However, all things considered, if we do well we will support someone  from the other side of the House in the  next Parliament. Thank you, Madam Speaker, for your leniency.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  Thank you. I was lenient, given the day that is in it.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">May I have a seconder for the nomination?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Donaldson</strong>:  Madam Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to second the nomination of William  Hay, a Member of the Legislative Assembly for the Foyle constituency. The city  of Londonderry  has had many stout defenders in the past, and I have no doubt that William will  continue to be one.<span class="Italic"> [Laughter.] </span>I hope that he will  not find himself under siege in that Chair; our best wishes go to him.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  Mr Hay, do you accept the nomination to be Speaker?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hay</strong>: I  accept the nomination.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  Are there any further proposals? The time for proposals has expired.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText"><em>Question,</em> That Mr William Hay be Speaker of this  Assembly, <em>put and agreed to.</em></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText"><em>Resolved (with cross-community support):</em></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">That Mr William Hay be Speaker of this Assembly.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  I formally declare that Mr William Hay has been elected as Speaker.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">11.15 am</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">With the Assembly&rsquo;s indulgence, before I vacate the Chair  for the last time, I would like to make a few personal remarks.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">When I first took up the position of Speaker, I confessed  to Members that I considered it a rather daunting task. Facing one&rsquo;s peers in  such a formal and unique role brings many challenges, and I was anxious to  ensure that I conducted myself in a manner that reflected the importance of the  office.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Looking back over the past year, I want to place on record my sincere thanks to Members for the  co-operation and goodwill that they extended to me from the outset, and  which has continued to this day. That goodwill has enabled us all to overcome  each and every challenge. My thanks also go to my two Deputy Speakers for the support that they have given to me and to the  Assembly as a whole.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I also wish to express my thanks to, and admiration for,  all the staff of the Assembly secretariat. The position of Speaker offers an  opportunity to observe in much greater detail the lengths to which our  secretariat officials go to serve the Assembly, and, throughout my time in  office, their commitment and loyalty to me personally has made my task a great  deal easier.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Members will know that my desire has always been to see a  stable, devolved Assembly in Northern    Ireland, working for the best interests of  everyone. As I leave office, my hope is that today heralds the beginning of  such an Assembly, and it has been my privilege to play some small part in  achieving that.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Although, as I said, I considered the role of Speaker to be  a daunting task, on taking up the office, I chose as my personal motto to  paraphrase that of the Special Olympics: I hope to succeed, but if I do not, I  will be brave in the attempt. I hope that I have lived up to that standard.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">To the Assembly, to each of its Members, and, in  particular, to my successor, I offer my very best wishes as you set about the  task for which you have been elected.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I now invite the Speaker to take the Chair, and I will hand  over the Assembly&rsquo;s gavel as a symbol of the office of Speaker of the Northern  Ireland Assembly.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">[Applause.]</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">(Mr Speaker in the Chair)</p>
		    <p class="H3SectionHeading">Speaker&rsquo;s Business</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Before I call the next item of business, I take this opportunity to thank  Members for electing me to the position of Speaker. As I take the Chair, I am  conscious of the role played by past Speakers of the Northern Ireland Assembly.  I express my own regard for the manner in which the outgoing Speaker conducted  herself in what was, for all Members, an often challenging and unusual  situation.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I find myself in the position of being the first Speaker to  have been elected directly by the Northern Ireland Assembly. That is, indeed, a  privilege, but one that carries with it a considerable burden. In electing me,  Members have placed their trust in me and in my ability to maintain the  authority and impartiality so essential to the office of Speaker. I will strive  to uphold thosevalues, and I will seek to act at all times as a servant  of the Assembly as a whole.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The authority of, and respect for, the office of Speaker is  drawn from the Members themselves and the co-operation that they offer to the  office. I trust that that respect and co-operation will be forthcoming, as it  has been in the past, and that together we will fulfil the responsibilities  placed on all of us, with mutual respect.  To that end, we shall now proceed.</p>
		    <p class="H3SectionHeading">Election Of Deputy Speakers</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Standing Orders require the election of three Deputy Speakers. The procedure  for electing Deputy Speakers will be the same as that adopted for the election  of Speaker. I will ask for nominations, which must be seconded. I will then  verify that the nominee accepts the nomination and will continue in that way  until there are no further nominations. I remind Members that a debate may take  place after I announce that the time for proposals has passed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Are there any proposals for the office of Deputy Speaker of  the Assembly?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText"><strong>Mr Adams: </strong>Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.  D&eacute;anaim comhghairdeas leat, a Cheann Comhairle. Molaim Francie Molloy do phost  an LeasCheann Comhairle. Ba mhaith liom c&uacute;pla focal a r&aacute; faoi Francie.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Speaker, I congratulate you on your elevation to the  post of Speaker.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I nominate Francie Molloy for the post of Deputy Speaker.  Like you, Mr Speaker, he is stout. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span> He is  an Armagh man who represents Tyrone. It is a source of great pleasure to me that he has been  involved in our struggle since the early days of the civil rights  movement; and it is with pleasure that I nominate Francie Molloy for the post  of Deputy Speaker.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I pray your indulgence also to extend condolences to the  Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone Gerry McHugh, who is this morning  attending his father&rsquo;s funeral and cannot  be with us today. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Is there a seconder for the nomination of Mr Molloy?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  Cuid&iacute;m leis an mholadh.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I second that proposal.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Mr Molloy, do you accept the nomination for the post of Deputy Speaker?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  T&aacute; m&eacute; toilteanach glacadh le hoifig an LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I accept the nomination.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Sir Reg Empey</strong>:  I beg indulgence, Mr Speaker, on behalf of my colleagues, to congratulate you.  Mr Donaldson described you as a stout  defender. However, we shall describe you as a robust defender, as we  hope you will be, of the interests of the Members of the Assembly.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I propose that Mr David McClarty, a Member for East Londonderry, be elected to the office of Deputy  Speaker. Mr McClarty has extensive experience of the Assembly Business  Committee, and I believe that he is eminently suited to the office of Deputy  Speaker.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Is there a seconder for the nomination of Mr McClarty?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  It is with pleasure that I endorse the nomination of Mr McClarty.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Mr McClarty, do you accept the nomination for the post of Deputy Speaker?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McClarty</strong>:  I accept the nomination, and maintain the theme of stoutness.<span class="Italic"> [Laughter.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText"><strong>Mr Durkan: </strong>Mr Speaker, I join with other party  leaders in congratulating you, the first directly elected Speaker of the  Northern Ireland Assembly. We have worked well as constituency colleagues, but  I know that that will stand me no favour from the Chair when I am out of line.  I know that you have been a solid representative of the Foyle constituency, and  have served Derry City Council well as its chairperson.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to nominate John Dallat, another Assembly Member for  East Derry &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>A Member</strong>:  Another stout Member.<span class="Italic"> [Laughter.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  Shares in Weight Watchers will be going up at a fast rate after this morning&rsquo;s  proceedings. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I nominate John Dallat, another MLA for East   Derry, to serve as Deputy Speaker. He served with distinction in  the previous Assembly; he has a solid record of service in local government and  has given very proud service to the entire community.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Do we have a seconder for the nomination of Mr Dallat?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  It gives me great pleasure to second the nomination of John Dallat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: On  a point of order, Mr Speaker. It will doubtless come as a great relief to the  House that I do not propose to make any nomination for the post of Deputy  Speaker at this time. However, feeling svelte and enthusiastic after my  exercise around the streets of Belfast  yesterday, I wish you well in your role as Speaker in robustly defending the  interests of this Assembly against all-comers, and we look forward to working  with you.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Mr Dallat, do you accept the nomination to be Deputy Speaker?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>:  Without any further elaboration on previous remarks, I humbly accept the  nomination.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Are there any further proposals?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I hear no further proposals. The time for proposals has  expired.</p>

		      First Minister (Designate) And Deputy First Minister (Designate)</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The next item of business is the affirmation of the terms of the Pledge of  Office for the First Minister (Designate) and the Deputy First Minister  (Designate). In a letter dated 3 May 2007, the Secretary of State advised the  former Speaker that he had received official confirmation from Dr Paisley and  Mr McGuinness that they had accepted their parties&rsquo; nominations to be First  Minister and Deputy First Minister respectively.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Members will be aware that the legislation provides that  the persons nominated shall not take up office until each of them has affirmed  the terms of the Pledge of Office contained in schedule 4 to the Northern  Ireland Act 1998.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Before we proceed, Members may find it helpful if the  Pledge of Office is read into the record so that it does not have to be read in  full by the First Minister (Designate), the Deputy First Minister (Designate)  or by other Ministers as they take up office.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">11.30 am</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Pledge of Office is as follows: </p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;To pledge: </p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">(a) to discharge in good faith all the duties of  office;</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">(b) commitment to non-violence and exclusively  peaceful and democratic means;</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">(c) to serve all the people of Northern Ireland equally, and to  act in accordance with the general obligations on government to promote  equality and prevent discrimination;</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">(ca) to promote the interests of the whole community  represented in the Northern    Ireland Assembly towards the goal of a  shared future;</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">(cb) to participate fully in the Executive Committee,  the North-South Ministerial Council and the British-Irish Council;</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">(cc) to observe the joint nature of the offices of  First Minister and deputy First Minister;</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">(cd) to uphold the rule of law based as it is on the  fundamental principles of fairness, impartiality and democratic accountability,  including support for policing and the courts as set out in paragraph 6 of the  St Andrews Agreement;</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">(d) to participate with colleagues in the preparation  of a programme for government;</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">(e) to operate within the framework of that programme  when agreed within the Executive Committee and endorsed by the Assembly;</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">(f) to support, and act in accordance with, all  decisions of the Executive Committee and Assembly;</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">(g) to comply with the Ministerial Code of Conduct.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Paragraph 6 of the St Andrews Agreement says:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;We believe that the essential elements of support for  law and order include endorsing fully the Police Service of Northern Ireland  and the criminal justice system, actively encouraging everyone in the community  to co-operate fully with the PSNI in tackling crime in all areas and actively  supporting all the policing and criminal justice institutions, including the Policing  Board.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Members, the Pledge of Office has now been read into the record of proceedings.  I will shortly ask the Rt Hon Dr Ian Paisley and Mr Martin McGuinness to affirm the terms of the Pledge of  Office.</p>
