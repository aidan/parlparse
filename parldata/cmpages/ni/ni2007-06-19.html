		    <p class="H2DocumentDate">Tuesday 19 June 2007</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The Assembly met at 10.30 am (Mr Speaker in the  Chair).</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
		    <p class="H3SectionHeading">Executive Committee Business</p>
		    <p class="H4StageHeading">Libraries Bill</p>
		    <p class="H4StageHeading">Second Stage</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure (Mr Poots)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That the Second Stage of the Libraries Bill [NIA  05/07] be agreed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The proposals behind this legislation will advance the  process to develop and modernise the public library <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt; ">service. The process began last year, with the publication</span> of  &lsquo;Delivering Tomorrow&rsquo;s Libraries&rsquo;, which sets out the policy direction for the  library service, identifying its core business and its major contribution. The  document specifies targeted action to enhance the value of the service and sets  out a series of standards against which to measure performance.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Most of us have experience of libraries, whether as  children or adults or when we take our own children to visit them. The public  library is a freely available and enormously significant source of enjoyment,  inspiration and independent learning. There is no doubt that libraries have the  capacity to empower people and communities. The use of libraries is voluntary,  and there are no entry or eligibility requirements.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As a business that is concerned not with doing things for  people but helping people to do things for themselves, libraries are in a  position to combat social <span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; ">exclusion and  provide equality of opportunity. Libraries</span> have a particular role in  facilitating lifelong learning for those who have missed out on education, and  their welcoming and flexible environment provides opportunity for those who are  uncomfortable in formal learning situations.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, the role of  libraries is not solely concerned with education. They also cater for  recreational, cultural and community  aspects in meeting modern-day needs. Libraries support social,  educational, artistic and economic endeavour and contribute to thriving  communities. As such, they are a significant element in the achievement of a  range of Government policies and priorities.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Library Service has a good record of reacting to change  and responding to new needs. For example, many senior citizens gain their first  experience of IT, emailing and the Internet at their local libraries, which  accommodate more than 1,000 computer terminals across Northern Ireland.  Furthermore, the Library Service has reacted quickly to the needs of recent  immigrants by providing books and other materials in their languages.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Libraries provide community spaces, learning spaces,  locations for cultural events and meeting places. One has only to visit some of  the new libraries in Ballymena, Lisburn, Strabane or Cookstown to see examples  of modern, accessible public spaces that are visually attractive, functional  and efficient. Those libraries have transformed their local communities by  providing traditional library services and by introducing space for new  activities.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to acknowledge the work of library staff in  delivering public services over the past three decades. Their contribution  increases the effectiveness of libraries through their offering structured  advice and guidance. The joint working of those staff across the education and  library boards in recent years has demonstrated the value of a single unified  service.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill will establish a single library service for the  whole of Northern Ireland  and will streamline the five existing library services, providing a unified  seamless service that can ensure equity in delivery and transmission of best  practice. The Bill will establish a non-departmental public body (NDPB) at a  regional level to deliver that service &mdash; a library authority that will be led  by a board comprising people who will be selected specifically for their  ability to oversee a library service that meets modern needs.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We expect efficiencies in the long term due to reductions  in management and administration. The protection of staff who transfer from  existing bodies to the library authority has been negotiated centrally with the  trade unions. All staff will be protected by the provisions of The Transfer of  Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 (TUPE). Pension  entitlements will also be protected. Those important matters are addressed in  schedule 2 to the Bill.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">During public consultation on the draft legislation, there  was strong support in principle for a single library service that would be led  by a library authority. Comments were also submitted on certain aspects of the  draft legislation. Following that consultation, changes were made to the draft  legislation in two areas to reflect the concerns that were raised. The first  change related to maintaining public access to core library services that is  free at the point of use. That commitment has been made clear in the text of  the Bill. The second change was to increase the maximum size of the board to  reflect concerns about achieving a quorum and reflecting diversity.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Our main objective is to improve the quality of service to  the public. Libraries have the potential to make a greater contribution to  quality of life and to meeting Government priorities. Ensuring the  establishment of the right structure to deliver that potential is crucial. A  library service that is delivered by a single body better reflects the  multifaceted role of libraries and their wide potential customer base. The  library authority will provide a clear central focus for the development and  promotion of the new service and will be a better vehicle to establish  partnerships for new service delivery at regional and local levels.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill represents an innovative proposal, which is unique  in the United Kingdom and  has generated considerable interest beyond Northern Ireland. I am firmly of  the view that the Bill represents the best way to provide the most effective  public library service most efficiently.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure (Mr McElduff)</strong>: Go raibh  maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht ar an  Bhille. I welcome this opportunity to address the Assembly. The Committee  wishes to place on record its formal concern at the process that was used by  the Minister to introduce the Bill to the Assembly. The absence of appropriate  notification to the Committee is not acceptable practice and spells out the  need for improved communication among the Minister, the Executive and the  Assembly on legislation matters.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">An example of that failure of communication, at best &mdash; and  perhaps disregard, at worst &mdash; was the Minister&rsquo;s introduction of the Bill at  First Stage on Monday 11 June 2007.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It was the last item of business and did not appear on the  Order Paper. I ask the Minister to explain why he introduced the Bill to the  Assembly in that fashion and why the Committee was not consulted about changes  to the Bill&rsquo;s legislative timetable, particularly <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt; ">as those matters have a direct bearing on the Committee&rsquo;s </span>future  work plan.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee commented on the Minister&rsquo;s announcement of  the appointment of a chief executive designate to the single library authority,  which will be created by the passage of this Bill. The Committee seeks an explanation  from the Minister as to the rationale behind the early announcement of an  appointment to a body that, as yet, has no legislative base. The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure, Mr David McNarry,  will develop that point in his contribution.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  I will not give way. Thanks all the same, Sammy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill&rsquo;s key purpose is to provide for the establishment  of a library authority to deliver a single public library service for all libraries  here. This is an inheritance from the review of public administration (RPA)  conducted under direct rule, and it is now the responsibility of this Assembly  to decide if that is the most appropriate form of management for our libraries.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Three management options have been considered by the  Department following the RPA proposal that a new education support body replace  the five education and library boards. The first option was that libraries  should be the responsibility of local government on the basis of no more than  seven local authorities. That was rejected because it was felt that it would  fragment the service by increasing five bodies to seven and break up an  increasingly unified system in which joint working at regional level has brought  benefits. The second option was that the  libraries should remain institutionally linked to education delivery.  That too was rejected on the basis that libraries have cultural, recreational  and community roles as well as an educational one and that the service would  benefit from a separate, dedicated managing body. A third option called for a  single management body, which, it is said, will promote operational  efficiencies in the longer term. I seek an assurance from the Minister that he  has not opted for a single library authority solely on the basis of cost and  financial efficiencies.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure will consider  carefully the legislation and examine in detail each clause of the Bill. It is  committed to conducting a detailed scrutiny and intends to consult widely and  to take evidence from interested parties. Libraries have vital cultural,  recreational and community roles and belong to everyone in our society. They  are there for everyone to use, irrespective of age, cultural background, or  address.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department indicated to the Committee that it has no  plans to change the current Government policy of providing core library  services free of charge. However, there is concern that that commitment is not  fully reflected in the Bill, and I seek reassurance from the Minister that he  has no plans to introduce charging for core library services. He may also wish  to consider making that commitment more  explicit in the legislation. Core library services elsewhere are  provided free of charge, and legislation should not be introduced in the North  that could potentially include a loophole that would allow for charging at some  date in the future.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee expects that any change in the management of  libraries will be for the purpose of providing a service that accommodates  everyone in society &mdash; children, the elderly, families, the visually impaired,  speakers of indigenous languages and people newly  arrived from other countries. It must be recognised that different  groups have different needs and require&shy;ments  of libraries &mdash; for example, in relation to opening hours, library stock  and other resources and facilities. Libraries must be accessible if their full  potential is to be maximised.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">10.45 am</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The creation of a single management body to replace the  current five education and library boards requires a geographical spread in the  composition of the board. The constitution of the new body should reflect the  entire population; urban and rural, and east and west of the Bann. It should  also represent people from different cultural backgrounds.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Crucially, the body should also include elected  representatives to address the democratic deficit. It should also have trade  union input. Those with expertise in the management of library services should  also be consulted. That will be essential if the new authority is to reflect  the aspirations and needs of all of the people.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As I understand it, one reason for creating a single  library authority is to make the management structures more streamlined. I hope  that that streamlining will result in more resources being made available for  front-line library services. However, I did not hear such a commitment in the  Minister&rsquo;s opening remarks.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Members of the public  are concerned about potential library closures, particularly in rural  areas. I hope that the new library authority will be able to reassure people  that there will be no such closures. Libraries are important tools in targeting  social need in rural and urban areas. There are genuine concerns about possible  library closures, and the resulting job losses, as has happened with post  offices.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Libraries, including the mobile library service, are a key  connection to the outside world for many people, particularly older people. I therefore seek the Minister&rsquo;s reassurance  that the new legislation will not endanger library services in rural areas.  Similarly, people living in other disadvantaged areas may not have access to  computers or places for study or homework. Libraries are a vital facility in  that regard. They also have a key role to play in literacy and lifelong  learning, as the Minister has acknowledged. They provide a place for people  outside the mainstream education system to access information and assistance.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The new library  authority will be a non-departmental public body that will be directly  answerable to the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure (DCAL). I expect that  the Department will closely monitor the new body to ensure that the current  standards of service are maintained and improved. I hope that the Minister will  reassure the House that that will be case and that the Department will monitor  the performance and service standards of the new library authority.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The creation of the new authority will result in changes  for library staff, who are currently employed by the education and library  boards. It is vital that the Department ensures that the experience and skills  of the current staff are fully utilised in the new authority and that the  transfer is made as smoothly as possible for them.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In particular, I am seeking a commitment from the Minister  that jobs will be safeguarded and that staff will maintain their current terms  and conditions in the new authority. The Department must also ensure that the  current stock and archives &mdash; a crucial part of our cultural wealth &mdash; are  protected during the transfer. Those assets  should be passed on to generations to come.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Every organisation can benefit from independent advice, and  libraries are no different. There is concern that the legislation does not  contain any provision for the authority to attain expert, independent advice,  which is available to libraries elsewhere. We should not be treated any  differently. I ask that that aspect be incorporated into the legislation. Go  raibh maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I call Mr Nelson McCausland.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  Take his temperature.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong><span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; ">Mr McCausland</span></strong>: The Member&rsquo;s enthusiasm knows no bounds. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to reflect on a number of aspects of the proposed  legislation. It is vital that the membership of the new library authority  reflects, and is representative of, Northern Ireland society  geographically, culturally and in every way, so that the different sectors in  the community are all represented.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The make-up of the Equality Commission (ECNI), the Northern  Ireland Human Rights Commission (NIHRC) and the Parades Commission are  intended, legislatively, to be representative. However, that is not that case  with the current education and library boards, for example. That should be  incorporated into the legislation.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As the Minister rightly said this morning, the Library  Service in Northern Ireland  plays a wide range of social, cultural and  educational roles, and contributes to the well-being of society in many  ways. Therefore, it is particularly important that the Assembly gets this  legislation right and ensures the best possible service for the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">One argument for introducing the legislation, which was referred to this morning, is that the Library  Service would be streamlined and that savings in administration could be  reinvested in books. In many ways, that is a plausible and good argument,  because there has been an underinvestment in books by library services across Northern Ireland.  However, as the Bill proceeds over the  coming months, I ask that Members be provided with clear figures on the  savings and economies that could be made. There is a definite need for clarity  on that issue, because when the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure  considered that matter a few weeks ago, no figures were available.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Many people will suspect  that there will be additional costs in the initial stages. Members will  already be aware that the single education authority will not only have a chief  executive, but eight deputies. We are therefore moving from a situation in  which there are five boards and five chief executives to one in which there  will be one chief executive and eight  deputies. Therefore, there must be clarity on what savings might be  made, and Members need to see those figures. I am confident that the Department  will carry out that work over the coming weeks.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Although it is necessary to have a governance structure in  place when the education and library boards are removed, we may have to  re-examine the situation in the longer term, as part of the review of public  administration.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There have been cases in which good integration of health,  council and library services can bring benefits to a community. For example, in  my constituency of North Belfast, leisure services &mdash; the swimming pool, etc &mdash;  health centre services and library services are being brought together in the  Grove Wellbeing Centre. That centre will provide integrated services and will  bring benefits to the whole community through the synergy that it will create.  The Assembly should examine similar such opportunities in the longer term.  Library services could also be provided in community or leisure facilities.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As for the longer-term vision for library services, we will  have to revisit that issue through the review of public administration, in  particular with respect to local authorities. Community planning will also come  into that debate.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">One aspect of the legislation that concerned me was that,  unlike the other countries in the United Kingdom,  Northern Ireland  does not have a national library. It could be argued that Northern Ireland  is not large enough to merit a national library. However, there should be some  reference in the legislation to the need to provide a regional service. That is  important to Northern    Ireland, particularly when one considers the  archived material in Belfast Central Library, the Linen Hall Library and other  libraries.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I would like to see a greater focus on that matter and some  consideration being given to how information in a readily accessible medium, in  book form, could be made available to the public, particularly on the history  of Northern Ireland and the history of Ulster. Much of that material is not  readily accessible, and it would be good to see legislation that provides for a  regional library service.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">&lsquo;Delivering Tomorrow&rsquo;s Libraries&rsquo; set out a vision for  libraries in Northern    Ireland. Libraries play an important role in  society. As the legislation is taken forward over the coming months, I hope  that the matters that have been mentioned, such as the size of the board and  clarity about the economies to be made, will be given serious consideration.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  As I do not follow the speeches made by the Minister of Finance&rsquo;s wife &mdash; in  case she has said something recently about the Bill &mdash; and, in light of the  demonstration of personal abuse focused on me by her husband last week, it is  important that I declare that some of my contribution on the Libraries Bill  includes information taken from a research brief.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On a previous occasion, when I spoke on a fisheries issue,  I used research, which, unknown to me at the time, was also used by another  Member in another place. However, some people have chosen to call that plagiarism. Having put research in its proper  perspective, I shall address this Bill.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Clear concerns arise from the manner in which the  Department has handled the Bill. The Chairman eloquently expressed the wider  view of the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure on those concerns, and I  share his request that the Minister takes note of, and addresses, those  concerns.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that I will not live to regret this, but, as this  is my first opportunity to address the Minister in the House, I wish him well  for his time in office. I compliment him on the freshness that he brings, not  only by knowing his brief, but by approaching matters in a cool, calm,  collected and constructive listening mode. That said, I strongly encourage many  of his more senior colleagues to copy &mdash; or plagiarise &mdash; his manner of dealing  with his brief.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, I am concerned about the Department&rsquo;s apparent  desire to rush this legislation through the House. The Committee Chairman has  dealt with the major points arising from that. However, the rush appeared all  the more obvious and aroused suspicions &mdash; perhaps where none may justifiably  exist &mdash; when, before the new Minister even had his feet under the table, the  Department advertised, interviewed and shortlisted  applicants for the position of chief executive of the new library  authority.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has been in position for only a few weeks.  When the Chairperson and I met him, shortly after he had taken up office, he  was unaware that the fast-tracking had taken place, and I appreciated his  honesty on that. However, in just a few weeks, the Department has moved  further, and in some haste, by appointing a chief executive designate. That  move was completed before the legislation for a new single authority had passed successfully through the  Assembly.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Is the Department&rsquo;s appointment of a chief executive in  that manner more evidence of control freakery, or is it presumption? If the  latter is the case, it is dangerous to presume that the legislation will pass  through the house unopposed and that its passage through the Committee would be  a mere formality. Will the Minister clarify that matter for us?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I seek a commitment from the Minister that jobs will be  safeguarded and staff will maintain their current terms and conditions under  the legislation for the new management of libraries, and that library closures  will not be used to negate any undertakings that he may give to the House on  the safeguards that I am requesting.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, the legislation requires the authority to  provide a public library service; it does not say how &mdash; or to what standard &mdash;  that will be done, other than in clause 2(2)(a), which cites:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;library materials sufficient in number, range and  quality to meet general requirements of adults and children&rdquo;.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is no mention of  it being either comprehensive or efficient. The Minister must give  assurances that library service provision will be comprehensive and efficient  and will meet the requirements of adults and children.</p>
		    <p class="B3SpeakerinChair" style="margin-top:6.4pt;margin-right:11.35pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;margin-left:11.35pt;">(Mr Deputy Speaker  [Mr McClarty] in the Chair)</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">11.00 am</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  I wish to raise concerns about a number of matters. First, like the Chairperson  and Deputy Chairperson of the Committee, I ask the Minister to clarify how the  First Stage of the Bill came to be on the  agenda without the approval of the Business Committee. The Committee was  taken aback when the Libraries Bill appeared on the Order Paper on Monday 11  June and had no time to prepare for it.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP welcomes the shift of responsibility for the  Library Service from the Department of Education to the Department of Culture,  Arts and Leisure. Such a move is logical and will enable the service to develop  a range of complimentary activities.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP wishes to ensure that, following the establishment  of a new library authority, libraries will target their activities at all  sections of the community, which should include visitors to Northern Ireland.  My party is concerned that such visitors are not being specified as a group to  be provided for. Also, we are concerned that ethnic-minority language groups  are not mentioned in the Bill. Both groups should be included in the  legislation as core groups.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText"><span style="letter-spacing:-.25pt; ">The Library Service  must be developed and broadened</span>. The existing service is under pressure  from cut-price books offered by retailers, and, as the Chairperson of the  Committee said, that has led to a serious reduction in borrowing and visits to  libraries.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I reiterate some points that I made to the Committee about  rural proofing. It is important that rural-proofing measures are applied to the  Library Service, as they are to any other public service. Social inclusion is  an urgent and ongoing concern in many rural areas, and the problem is being  exacerbated by the threats to post offices and small rural schools. The SDLP is  concerned that library closures in recent years have taken their toll on rural  communities, and it is clear that the libraries most at risk are in rural  areas. Library services in those areas must be valued as community hubs, and  their closure would be contrary to acute social needs. The contribution of  rural libraries to local literacy and skills development must be as valued as it  is in urban areas, and any future library strategy must include a commitment to  protect that provision.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Some instances of rural library provision should be valued  as examples of good practice. Rural libraries are  addressing questions about their viability by targeting local schools.  To increase their footfall, they are specifically focusing on child literacy  provision. Creativity and best practice such as this should be nurtured,  encouraged and rewarded.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP considers the Library Service to be vital. Therefore, the service must be changed and  repositioned to reconnect with more people. That repositioning will  require new ways to deliver existing services and the addition of new services.  That will involve a process of change, which will require leadership.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP wishes libraries, under the new library authority,  to improve their traditional roles as centres for the enjoyment of books and  borrowing and become centres of excellence for education, providing compli&shy;mentary  ranges of services in which literacy and numeracy are promoted and facilitated  in informal and pleasant environments, and where learning is fun. The SDLP wishes libraries to be centres of lifelong  learning for adults of all ages and to actively explore possibilities  for the greater inclusion of other forms of art and cultural activities.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The new library authority must have the freedom to carry  out its work, but within the democratic account&shy;ability and control that is  required. For example, when the new authority drafts its standing orders, it is  important that they are presented to the Minister and the Committee for  approval.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that the Assembly sends a positive message  to existing staff. Staff face changes in their employer and in their work  practices, and their morale is currently quite poor. They are concerned about  the impact on their terms and conditions. It is important that terms and  conditions are protected and that new employees are offered the same terms and  conditions as existing employees. I urge the Minister to work closely with the  Northern Ireland Public Service Alliance (NIPSA) on the transfer of  undertakings to ensure a smooth transition  for employees. The Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure intends to  invite NIPSA officials to a meeting to discuss their concerns.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In order to provide a modern, vibrant and expanded Library Service, working practices will have to  change. Old working practices will be conducted in different ways, and  there will be new working practices, which may or may not turn out well; that  is the nature of change. It is important that the Assembly values staff and  urges them to continue to provide a professional service for everyone. Members  want to work with library staff and retain their expertise. We also want to  lead, promote and improve the Library Service so that by the end of this process, we will have a better service.  Members, and the public whom we serve, value the contribution of Library Service staff, and we thank them.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I ask the Minister to consider carefully the location of  the new library authority. I am sure that he will consider all regions in Northern Ireland,  including the north-west.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  Much of what I intended to say has already been rehearsed by the Chairperson  and members of the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  No need to say it again, then.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  No, absolutely not.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, I want to ask the Minister a question. Is the  public library service intended for all citizens, or is it only for people who  can use library premises? For instance, what provision is there for hospitals,  prisons, residential homes, and so forth? Staff in those institutions do not  have specialist library knowledge and will  be unaware of the range of available materials. Library provision for  such institutions should be a statutory obligation on the service.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The schools library service will become the responsibility  of the Department of Education. As Members have already said, the  centralisation and relocation of that service will have implications for rural  primary schools, in that it will cut them off from book and information  specialists. Previously, teachers in rural schools, who do not live near  bookshops, had access to those specialists. However, they and their pupils will  be disadvantaged because they will now not be able to consult specialist  library staff whose advice is based on their constant use of information  resources.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Consideration must be given to the needs of blind or  partially sighted people. A framework for their needs should not depend on  commercial organisations.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Most of the Alliance Party&rsquo;s concerns have already been  voiced during the debate. I await the Minister&rsquo;s response to those  contributions.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Browne</strong>:  I have spent the majority of my working life in the education service, so I am  acutely aware of the tangible benefits that libraries provide to education. The  local education and library boards are being subsumed into one streamlined  authority, so it is natural and, indeed, sensible that the provision of library  services should enjoy the same efficiency savings and rationalisation that will  ultimately benefit those people who use the facilities and the many others who  expect Members to administer public finances in a mature fashion on their  behalf.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Although I intend to support the Second Stage of the Bill  to that end, as a member of the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure, I have  yet to be totally convinced of the need for a separate autonomous authority specifically for the provision of  library services.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Libraries Bill was, of course, introduced by the direct  rule Ministers and inherited by my hon Friend the Minister of Culture, Arts and  Leisure, Mr Poots. However, there will be time in the weeks following the  Second Stage of the Bill to deliberate on its contents and effects, and, if  necessary, consider local alternatives and other options that would enhance the  effect of such legislation.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As it stands, schedule 1(2)(1)(b) of the Bill states that  the authority should consist of:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;not fewer than 7 or more than 14 other members,&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">&mdash; that is, alongside the chairman. Although that  number may be correct, unwieldy and cumbersome bodies tend to operate at a much  slower pace, as my personal athletic record would attest. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span> There is no provision in the Bill for a specified number of interested  stakeholders or local representatives.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Local representatives have built up years of experience  serving on education and library boards, which  would be of infinite benefit to any such authority and maintain a local  dimension to a dramatically centralised body. In addition, as we have heard,  the trade unions, focused interested bodies and other stakeholders could potentially make a great contribution;  however, the legislation does not guarantee a place for those agencies.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Neither am I convinced by the argument for separating  library services from the provision of education. As some Members pointed out,  adults and others with learning difficulties are often sidelined or ignored by  education and library boards, which, perhaps, focus more on primary and  post-primary provision. That situation highlights the need for greater  harmonisation, or, if necessary, an amalgamation of the relevant functions of  the Department of Education and the Department for Employment and Learning  rather than a separate library authority.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The diversity of views in the Committee for Culture, Arts  and Leisure ranges from support for the new authority as outlined in the Bill,  to input or even control by local  government, or for removing altogether the  idea of a separate authority and simply administering libraries through the new education body. In  supporting the Second Stage, the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure  knows that it must thrash out those issues in the  weeks ahead. It is to be hoped that with the agreement of the Minister,  the Bill will proceed either intact or amended,  having achieved a consensus among Members of the House.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brolly</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I will be brief, because my hon  colleague Mr McElduff, speaking as  Chairperson of the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure, made a  comprehensive presentation. It would be  remiss of me, and Mr McElduff would be disappointed, if I did not also  mention that he played corner-forward for the Tyrone minor county Gaelic  football team.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Some years ago, a very clever gentleman cynically said:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;People who read books do so because they are too lazy  to think for themselves.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I disagree; reading encourages people to think. There is no  point in reinventing the wheel, so I will simply reinforce the need for  libraries and access to books.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">When William Ewart  introduced his Public Libraries Bill to the House of Commons in 1849, he  encountered a great deal of opposition from the Conservatives, who argued that  the rate-paying middle and upper classes would be paying for a service that  would be mainly used by people like us &mdash; the working classes. One Member of Parliament argued that:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;People have too much knowledge already: it was much  easier to manage them twenty years ago; the more education people get, the more  difficult they are to manage.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is no better  argument to be made for promoting libraries and for having the very best  library authority.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">11.15 am</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McCausland mentioned the obvious necessity that the  board in charge of libraries be representative. Before the appointment of that  board, which will be made up of a chief executive and eight deputies, it is  important that we ascertain that it is totally competent to do the job that it  has been employed to do. Prospective board members must display to the  interview panel that they know all about the job.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It would be a pity if the proposed savings of &pound;0&middot;6million  in 2009-10, which are set to double in 2010-11, were to be gobbled up by a  chief executive who thought it necessary to employ a consultant as soon as the  first difficult question arose.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Schedule 2 to the Bill has important implications for  education and library boards&rsquo; current employees. Contracts are to be  transferred from those bodies to the library authority. Dealing with unions and  ensuring fair treatment for employees, who have done a very good job up until  now, will take up a great deal of time at Committee Stage. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  Efter 25 yeirs o&rsquo; gye bad unner fundin&rsquo; an no bein&rsquo; leuked aboot, hit&rsquo;s lang  past the tim&rsquo; at this Semmelie saen hoo important hit bes tae hae a library  system at hes eneuch staff an catter in onie forrit an&rsquo; richt thinkin&rsquo; society.

		    <p class="B3BodyText">After 25 years of severe underfunding and neglect, it is  high time that the Assembly recognised how important  it is that any forward-thinking, right-thinking society has a fully  staffed, fully financed and fully operational library system.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">To know where one is going, one must first know where one  has been. That is applicable in Northern    Ireland, because we recognise the library  not only as a place of education but as a place that celebrates culture and  history.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure will have input  in the library authority, which will be accountable to all members of the  community, and dedicated solely to providing the community with superior  services.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I congratulate the chief executive of the South Eastern  Education and Library Board, Irene Knox, on being appointed chief executive  designate of the library authority. She is a  lady of tremendous experience and ability who will provide the necessary  drive and the focus for the new authority.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is of the utmost importance to retain high-quality  services at least cost to the public. Understandably, a charge must be levied  for certain services, but I stress how important it is that all age groups have  free access to books, and to information through the Internet. Our young people  are trained in school, but it should be libraries&rsquo; priority to train and help  the older generation, who can benefit as  much &mdash; if not more &mdash; as our children from the Internet. Training and  enhancement of skills for all should be a  priority for the new library authority.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The library authority must also honour the promises of the  previous library-service provider. People from Newtownards and the Ards Peninsula  are still trying to squeeze into a tiny building, which has insufficient books  and inadequate computer access, even though Newtownards was promised a new  library in 2002.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have written to the Minister to ask for an update on the  newbuild in Newtownards, as the present library has neither been updated nor  refurbished for some 30 years. It remains as it was some time ago. Although the  population of Ards has grown, its library has not kept pace with either the  demographical trends or the level of building in the town.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As far back as 2002, I requested details of the new library  for Newtownards from the then Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure, Michael  McGimpsey. He replied that Bangor  was second on the Department&rsquo;s priority list and that Ards was next. In 2003,  my colleague Iris Robinson asked a similar question in Westminster and was told that the Department  was considering the new library.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Here we are four years further on, and there is no sign of a new library for Ards. Work has begun in Bangor, of course,  and, therefore, I ask that the new library authority honour the previous  arrangements and begin plans for the Newtownards library. It is imperative that  the new library authority retain the understanding that Ards will receive a  newbuild library.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Once again, I have asked a Minister of Culture, Arts and  Leisure to outline the cost, proposed location and likely completion date for  the new library. I look forward to the reply. In 2002, it was estimated that  the newbuild would cost &pound;2 million. I have no doubt that, as time has marched on, that amount has risen.  However, it is for the newly constituted library authority to deliver on  the priority list to which the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure is  working. The new library in Newtownards must be delivered urgently.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The new library authority must cater for people with visual  disabilities, as, at present, they are not provided with the necessary  services.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Previous Members who spoke referred to mobile libraries.  For some of my constituents, mobile libraries provide their only contact with  people outside their own homes. Many people are keen that the service provided  by the mobile libraries be not only retained, but enhanced. I request that that  be the case, not just for my constituency of Strangford, but for the whole of  the Province.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the Second Stage of the Libraries Bill. It is  vital that Members remember what we were told yesterday: consultation, and the opportunity to table amendments to  the Bill, can continue until the second or, perhaps, even the third, week of  September. Therefore Members have a long time in which to consult on the Bill,  table amendments, and ensure that all points of view are taken on board.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Everyone should have an interest in our libraries, and it is important that those who do not are  encouraged to change. I hope that steps are taken to encourage our  society, which was once rich in the gifts of story telling and tales, to  discover the joys of our culture and heritage that can be found in the books  and other services that the new library authority will provide.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the Bill.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  Given the number of Members who have spoken, many of my questions have been  asked. Therefore I will not rehearse them.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have concerns about the level of local involvement in the  Libraries Bill and that local people might become detached from the process.  Therefore will the Minister tell me how local people can ensure that they have input in the decision-making process? For  example, will they have a say in the location of new libraries?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Is the Minister aware of the timescale for the commencement  of building the long-awaited library in Railway Street in Antrim?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  I am disappointed that the Minister has chosen to introduce the Libraries Bill  at this time. The Department seems to want to drive forward decisions before  any real consultation has taken place. Whether it is, as was announced this  morning, setting a nine-day deadline for the decision on the stadium at the  Maze or the premature introduction of the Libraries Bill, we are seeing the  dregs of direct rule &mdash; Departments think that they can still behave in an  unaccountable way.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Ministers.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>: I will come to that in a moment or two.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is still a Civil Service mentality in Northern Ireland.  Civil servants and Departments have been used to controlling Ministers like  puppets on strings and still think that they can drive through measures that  may or may not be good for Northern    Ireland or have public support. They are not  even prepared to have their proposals tested in the Assembly, which is the forum in which such decisions are meant to be  made.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As far as the current structure is concerned, I understand  what the Minister has said. Although we do not yet know what will happen &mdash; as  the Minister of Education has not yet announced what she intends to do with  education and library boards &mdash; the current structure for education could be  dismantled by April next year and, if that happens, a structure needs to be put  in place for libraries. However, I would have thought that, rather than  changing the current structures immediately, we would have had some opportunity  to consider alternative temporary measures until we know what will happen under  the RPA.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The changes proposed in this Bill are linked to decisions  on education and local government, but we do not know what those decisions are  as yet. Indeed, if anything, this Bill jumps ahead of those aspects of the RPA.  I had understood that all parties in the Assembly shared a desire to ensure  that, even if the RPA process has to be lengthened out a little, it leaves us  with a structure of government in Northern Ireland that provides for  more efficient delivery of services and stops the uncertainty for a long time  to come.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In his opening remarks, the Minister said that he had had  to make some quick decisions &mdash; whether those decisions needed to be taken as  quickly as possible is a matter of debate &mdash; but that we would be able to  revisit the issue. However, that is not what the explanatory and financial  memorandum to the Bill indicates. The  memorandum states that the Bill will put in place:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the framework for the direction of the library  service over the next ten years&rdquo;.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">That does not strike me as an interim measure that could be  easily changed or revisited, either during the RPA process or at some point  subsequent to that.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Another point that I want to make concerns the appointment  that the Minister and his Department &mdash; and, again, they are not unique in this  &mdash; have made. I make no comment on the person who has been appointed, but am  concerned by the fact that, before the Bill was introduced and before the  Assembly had had an opportunity to comment on the proposed structure, a person  had already been appointed to head that structure. The Department of Education  has done that as well.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Eventually, the Minister of Education will introduce a Bill  to determine what kind of structure we should have  for education &mdash; and that structure will, supposedly, be for debate in  this Assembly. If the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure thinks that I am  being hard on him, he should wait until I deal with the Minister of Education &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  No. I offered to make a helpful intervention  during the speech of the Member opposite. I am always happy to give way,  but I like to see some reciprocation and, without that, I will not give way.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The same thing is happening in education, where a chief  executive designate has been put in place before we even know what the  structure will be. We need to escape from that. If this Assembly and its  Committees are to have any genuine input into policy in Northern Ireland,  we must have an opportunity to discuss these issues properly, not within a  framework of tight legislation with decisions already made and people already  appointed.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">11.30 am</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There appears to be a belief in the Assembly that we should  try to get decision-making down as close to communities as possible &mdash; and that  may affect debate on a whole range of other issues as well, including education  and local government. Perhaps that belief is coloured by the fact that most  Members have also served on local councils, and having served in local  government for 20-odd years, I think that that is good. Sometimes councils can  be frustrating places, and the decisions that are taken can be bad &mdash; just as  they can be elsewhere &mdash; but at least they are taken at a local level. This Bill  will ensure that decisions about what is a basic service will be taken at a  regional level, and not at a local level.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  Control freaks.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  It is not a case of control freakery. It is something that originated during  direct rule: civil servants hoped that they would never have to have any  interface with local politicians, which can sometimes be a bit uncomfortable.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There will be inefficiencies if decisions are taken away  from local areas, and I will give an example of that. The Member for North Belfast Nelson McCausland referred to  the Grove Wellbeing Centre. When the decision had to be made about putting  health and library facilities in one centre &mdash; which made sense, as it brought  leisure facilities together, and there were certain economies of scale &mdash;  Belfast City Council had to deal, not with a regional authority, but with the  Belfast Education and Library Board. It was a different authority, but at least  it was operating in the same geographical area.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, it took two  and a half years to get a decision on whether the Belfast Education and  Library Board could buy into the library facilities. One reason for the delay  was that the Belfast Board had a certain path for its capital spending  programme, and Belfast City Council had a different path for its capital  spending programme. Belfast City Council had &pound;15 million to spend on a  well-being centre, and the Belfast Board had other priorities. It took two and  a half years to bring those two things together and make a decision. If Members  believe that libraries are part of leisure, and that local councils will be  delivering leisure, then it makes sense to have the decision-making process all  under the one roof.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister talked about efficiency, and Sinn F&eacute;in, wrongly,  rubbished it. Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s view on the whole question of efficiency is that  things should not be done in order to save money; that that should not be a  factor that counts in this decision.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  I doubt whether the Member is making a point of order.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Point of order.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I want to clarify that when I spoke to  the House this morning, I was doing so in my capacity as the Chairperson of the  Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: That is not a point of order, Mr McElduff.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>: I did not think that it would be a point of order, and I am  glad that you intervened quickly, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I know that Sinn F&eacute;in does not care too much about spending  taxpayers&rsquo; money. Its control of the purse strings, and its unending demands  for spending, in local government show that Sinn F&eacute;in is not a good custodian  of public money.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister is right.  If efficiencies can be generated, then that should be one of the factors  involved in deciding whether to have a single authority or devolve matters  locally. It is only one factor, but it is an important one.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The explanatory and financial memorandum, however, gives no  indication as to whether savings will be generated. There is an indication that  there will be upfront costs and that, indeed, in the first year it might cost  more &mdash; actually, that will also apply to a lot of the other reorganisations.  Based on the memorandum, it is  impossible to make a judgement as to whether there will be savings. It states:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;There is no separate accounting process within the  Education and Library Boards &hellip; part of corporate services &hellip; therefore the  existing libraries budget within DCAL covers direct costs only.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Members do not actually know, therefore, the total cost of delivering the Library Service under the  existing boards. How, then, can we know whether there are going to be  overall savings? That is something that we should  know before we make a final decision on the Bill.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The other thing that I have noticed is that upfront costs  have been identified already. New premises are mentioned. Again, Members must  ask whether, if we went down the road of keeping libraries within the education  and skills authority &mdash; if that is set up &mdash; we would need separate premises.  Would we need separate premises if the service were given to local councils?  Would there not then be certain costs that could be shared, rather than setting  up a brand new structure for libraries?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My last point is on accountability. Under schedule 1 to the  Bill, the Department may appoint up to 14 members to the library authority. The  Bill does not say whether those 14 members will include any public  representatives; therefore, the quango that will be set up will be able to  delegate decision-making to committees and to officers &mdash; a further remove from  accountability. Decisions have to be made about the types of services, the  costs of services, the opening hours of libraries, the location of libraries,  and everything else, and I am not sure that those are the kinds of decisions  that we want to give to a quango in an era when we want to involve local people  more.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Those are all issues that need to be addressed. I hope that  those issues will be teased out during the debate on the Bill and that there  will be a close scrutiny of all of those kinds of points. I regret that this  has been rushed to the Assembly in the way that it has. I understand that, to a certain extent, it is an inheritance  from direct rule. Nevertheless, there are ways in which the process could have been slowed down. The message must be sent  very clearly from the Assembly today to Government  Departments that the period of un-scrutinised Government, which happened  during direct rule, is over. Assembly Members will want to have their input and  to ensure that, whatever decisions are made about future structures in Northern Ireland,  there are clear opportunities for Members to do so.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In the Education Committee, I have already encountered  people who have come along and been asked  awkward questions and have then gone back to their various bodies and said:  &ldquo;That crowd there &mdash; sure, they know nothing. Did you hear the questions that  they were asking?&rdquo; Just because the questions were awkward does not mean that  they should not have been asked. For a long time, those professionals have not had any scrutiny. Perhaps sometimes  Members do ask stupid questions &mdash; there is a learning curve for us &mdash; but that is what democracy is all about, and  that is what we should be standing up for in this House today.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: On  the whole, it has been a useful and informative debate, and I thank Members for  their contributions. Most of the points that have been raised I can cover now;  if there any that I am not able to, I will write to the Members involved.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairperson of the Committee of Culture, Arts and  Leisure, along with Mr Brolly and Mr Ramsey, made a point about the  introduction of the Libraries Bill to the Assembly. That process reflected the  Executive&rsquo;s wish that, when devolution returned, Bills be should be brought to  the Assembly for early consideration. My Department thought it timely to  introduce the Bill. The First and Second Stages were introduced in a form  intended to assist the House in allowing the matter to go to Committee and to  allow the Committee to get its teeth into the issues.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Next week, I represent my Department at the Smithsonian  Folklife Festival in Washington,  and will, therefore, be unavailable. That  is why the Libraries Bill was introduced  in that way &mdash; it was not a Machiavellian exercise, and there was no sleight of hand. My intention was to  get the Bill onto the table before the summer recess to allow the researchers  to start on their work and the Committee to address the issues.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I look forward to the Committee process. By introducing the Libraries Bill in that way, the  Committee will have not only its full 30 days but the possibility of an  extension to that time, should that be considered necessary. Making haste now  will allow Committee members to take their time in considering the real issues,  and the Committee&rsquo;s scrutiny of the Bill will benefit. My officials briefed the  Committee in advance of the Bill&rsquo;s introduction. I will work closely with it in  developing the Bill and in considering proposed amendments. I shall be  surprised if none is proposed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McElduff raised the issue of library closures. Over the  past few years, several libraries have closed; however, over the course of  time, populations and people&rsquo;s needs change. Library services have to adapt to  those circumstances. I do not anticipate a significant number of library  closures, but I cannot state categorically that no libraries will close. I do  not have a crystal ball and cannot look into the future.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Ultimately, the wish is to improve library provision,  increase library service and make it more readily available to the public. My Department will take that role.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Libraries Bill offers an exciting way forward. Library  services will no longer be a poor relation, or an after-thought, among the responsibilities of an education and  library board; rather, the proposed Northern Ireland libraries  authority will drive them forward. The authority will be exclusively committed  to meeting the needs of those members of the public who use library services,  and will compete for the finance to deliver library service. That commitment  will be to the benefit of library users.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McElduff mentioned the issue of opening hours. People  want public services to be available when they are free to make use of them,  and when they can do so as families. Libraries must, therefore, be open in the  evenings and at weekends. My Department has set targets to ensure that opening  hours are extended beyond the working day to accommodate local need.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome Mr McNarry&rsquo;s return to terra firma. <span class="Italic">[Laughter]</span>.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank him for his kind remarks. However, as his speech  progressed, I began to think he was again going into orbit. I thank him,  nonetheless.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to the appointment of the chief executive  designate of the proposed Northern    Ireland library authority, I declare again  that there has been no sleight of hand. The post of chief executive designate  is a secondment, and the position will not become permanent before the  Libraries Bill has become law.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  Will the Minister clarify that statement? I understand that the position of  chief executive designate is a secondment. Is it therefore true that the  appointee will be chief executive of an education and library board that will  become defunct? How long will the secondment last?</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">11.45 am</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  The chief executive designate is the current chief executive of the South  Eastern Education and Library Board. If the House should reject the idea of establishing a single library authority, the  secondment would end immediately. The chief executive designate will  carry out the professional arrangements for establishing a library authority by  March 2008.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to recognise that, come March 2008, the  education and library boards will cease to exist. If, for some reason, the  boards happen to survive beyond March 2008,  we are prepared for that situation. However, if the boards do not  survive, and we have not done what is required of us and taken care of  arrangements for libraries, there will be no organisation with the competence  to deal with library services.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is therefore essential that we put the wheels in motion  to establish a single library authority. That is not to presume that the House  will automatically follow. The Department requires the House to make the  decision to proceed with a single library authority before the post of chief executive can become permanent. The chief executive designate has accepted the  position on the understanding that it is a designate position and a secondment  and the post cannot become permanent until the House decides to approve the  establishment of a single library authority. I trust that that clears up the  matter.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McElduff and Mr P Ramsey mentioned employment and staff  contracts. Employment contracts will transfer to the new employers, and  contractual terms will be agreed under the TUPE regulations. In addition,  contracts may only be varied subject to constraints specified in those  regulations. The TUPE regulations provide only limited protections for  pensions. As public-sector pensions are an important part of the remuneration  package, it was considered important to provide additional protections for  them. The Libraries Bill does that, so it is actually more helpful to staff  than the TUPE regulations.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McCausland raised a number of issues. He mentioned the  joint provision of services at the Grove Wellbeing Centre, which is under  development in north Belfast.  Library services are being delivered alongside other public services in many  other places, too. They can add to health and education services and retail  outlets. I would like to expand that approach in other areas. We will continue  to give full consideration to useful  partnerships that can improve the accessibility of libraries for the  public. Mr McCausland also mentioned that we do not have a national library,  and I will consider that matter in due course.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Start-up costs have been estimated at &pound;67,000, and the  Department has the funding for that.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McNarry mentioned delivery standards. The first set of public standards for Northern Ireland  was published in the document &lsquo;Delivering Tomorrow&rsquo;s Libraries&rsquo;, which  was launched last July. Those standards include maintaining expenditure and  stock and improving opening hours and accessibility. Library service  performance will be monitored against those standards, and my Department will  publish reports on how the service is meeting them.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McElduff and Mr Shannon raised the issue of charges.  There are no plans to introduce charges for core library services, and I want  to put that into context. At the moment, there are charges for some library  services; for example, users will incur charges for the late return of books or  for photocopying documents. However, there are no charges for core services,  nor will there be. I want to make it clear that core services will continue to  be provided free to the public at the point of delivery. There will be no  charges for those services unless approved by the Department under a particular  scheme.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Several Members, including Mr Ramsey, referred to services  in rural areas. There are clearly difficulties in delivering any public service  to an area where the population is dispersed. Library services are provided in  some of those areas through mobile libraries when it is not viable to provide  such areas with a purpose-built library. To ensure that local library services  are maintained, &lsquo;Delivering Tomorrow&rsquo;s  Libraries&rsquo; requires that 85% of households should have access to a  library building or have a regular mobile library stop within two miles.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McCarthy asked about library services for schools, which  will continue to be the responsibility of the Department of Education. The  chief executive designate of the library authority and the Education and Skills  Authority will consider the best way of ensuring that all parties work closely  together for the mutual benefit of all services.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Lord Browne raised the matter of appointments to the board.  Board members will be appointed on merit, in line with the code of practice  that has been issued by the Commissioner for Public Appointments. I do not see  any need for a large number of board members, and the plan for between seven  and 14 members is in line with recommended good practice. I am happy to  consider the views of the Assembly, and of the Committee in particular, on  nominated places. The democratic involvement of people at a level at which  local accountability can be introduced is important, if not crucial, and that  is something that we are happy to consider.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On options for library services, Lord Browne raised their  remaining within the education authorities. Libraries have cultural,  recreational and community roles, as well as an educational one, and they also  have a wider customer base than schools. Moreover, they play a significant role  in providing informal learning opportunities. Delivery alongside schools does  not reflect that wider and more informal role.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is some evidence to suggest that the junior status of  libraries in the education and libraries boards has not been to their benefit  and to the benefit of their customers. For example, there has been an historic  lower level of library use in Northern Ireland  than in other parts of the United    Kingdom. Earlier, I stressed that libraries  could make a better case for themselves under their own authority, because they  would be wholly committed to the delivery of library services.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A number of Members raised the need to protect the  interests of staff. The policy objectives behind schedule 2(4) were agreed with  the Public Service Commission and the trade unions. That demonstrates the  commitment to staff and to their interests.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Shannon raised the issue of Newtownards Library. It is  unusual for Mr Shannon to be parochial, but I will forgive him in this  instance. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The South Eastern Education and Library Board is revising  an economic appraisal and considering the cost and option of delivering a  replacement library on the site of the old Castle Gardens   Primary School. The board  anticipates that that appraisal will be submitted to the Department by the end  of June 2007, and, subject to consideration  and approval by my Department and by the Department of Finance and  Personnel, it should be possible for construction to commence on the site in  about a year to 15 months. That is to allow for detailed design work, the  planning application and the approval process, so if the planning process is  held up, do not blame this Minister.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I also agree with Mr Shannon about the importance of the  mobile library service for meeting the needs of people in rural areas and of  people who have difficulty in gaining access to those services in other ways.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Trevor Clarke referred to local accountability, and I trust  that I went some way towards dealing with that matter when discussing the  library authority&rsquo;s membership. Ultimately, the library authority will be  accountable to my Department, to whoever the Minister happens to be of the  Department, and to the Assembly Committee of the day. Democratic accountability  will not be lost as a result of the Bill.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I make it clear to the House that the Assembly will have  control over the library authority, its operation and its chief executive.  Members should bear in mind that all matters relating to the authority will  come before the Minister and, ultimately, the House.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Trevor Clarke mentioned the newbuild library in Antrim.  Subject to approval, it is anticipated that work on the site will begin in  November or December this year. I thank the Member for attending this debate,  and for his interest in the new library and his ongoing work in relation to it.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My colleague Sammy Wilson was the last Member to speak in  the debate, and he raised a number of issues.  Prior to its introduction, there was a consultation process on the  Libraries Bill. Of the 24 consultation responses received, only one consultee  suggested that library functions would be better served by local authorities.  The RPA considered that increasing the number of education and library boards  from five to seven would make the system  more unwieldy. Similarly, if the Assembly were to opt for 11 or 15  councils in Northern Ireland, that would be akin to moving from the ridiculous  to the ludicrous. While I certainly would not recommend that route, I shall,  however, be in the hands of the House on whatever decision is taken.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Wilson also mentioned the mentality of the Civil  Service. The main difficulties that I have had with the mentality of the Civil  Service, especially when the Assembly was suspended, were its inability to make  decisions, its tendency to be risk-averse and its apparent lack of courage to  make decisions. I assure the Member that my courage will not be found lacking  when difficult decisions have to be made. I will not make decisions as a puppet  of a civil servant. Decisions will be made based on evidence that I, as  Minister, will receive.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Sammy Wilson suggested that the Department should have  considered other alternatives. I have not heard any alternatives. Neither have  I heard an alterative on the other subject that he mentioned &mdash; I have been  waiting for two and a half years for an alternative on that issue, so setting a  deadline now might not be a bad thing, as it might concentrate minds. However,  I cannot afford to wait two and a half years for an alternative to the new  library authority, because something must be in place by March, otherwise there  will be no library service. I will not wait for two and a half years for  alternatives from anyone else.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I also remind Members that the explanatory and financial  memorandum is not part of the legislation, and we are dealing only with the  Bill.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">New premises are usually located wherever the Government  have an existing stock of premises, and, under the RPA, premises will become  available for library headquarters. If no premises are available &mdash; and if Sammy  Wilson is ruling out east Antrim as the potential location for the headquarters  of the new library service &mdash; that will be noted.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText"><span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank Members for their contributions, and I look forward  to working with the Committee on the Bill.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic"><strong>Resolved</strong>:</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">That the Second Stage of  the Libraries Bill [NIA 5/07] be agreed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">&nbsp;</p>
		    <p class="H4StageHeading">Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill</p>
		    <p class="H4StageHeading">Second Stage</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">That the Second Stage of the Health (Miscellaneous  Provisions) Bill [NIA 2/07] be agreed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill amends the provisions of the Health and Personal  Social Services (Northern    Ireland) Order 1972 in relation to the regulation of the four family practitioner  services: general practitioners; opticians; pharmacists; and dentists. It  sets out a legislative base for new contracts for dental practitioner services</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">12.00 noon</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill allows for greater protection of patients and  equality among practitioners providing treatment to them. The health and social  services boards and Health Service tribunals have a role to play, and the  measures included in the Bill will strengthen their roles further.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill also amends the Smoking (Northern Ireland)  Order 2006 and makes provision to permit smoking by performers taking part in  performances if artistic integrity so requires.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The measures will also help Northern   Ireland to retain parity with rest of the UK as far as  possible. The draft Bill has been the subject of a wide-ranging consultation  exercise, and I am pleased to say that respondents  were generally in favour of the new policies.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The main provisions will  allow for the implementation of a new contract for the provision of  dental services by general dental practitioners that will underpin a  modernised, high-quality dental service provided through real contracts between  health and social services boards and general dental practices.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is consensus that the current contractual  arrangements for Health Service dentists no longer meet the needs of dentists  or patients. Many Health Service dentists  are particularly unhappy with the current fee-per-item payment, a system that focuses on treatment carried  out rather than on preventative measures.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">General dental practitioners do a valuable job and it is  our intention to involve them in the wider process of Health Service  modernisation including pay reform, improving working lives, lifelong skills  improvement and clinical governance.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The new primary dental service will improve the working lives of dentists by reducing the  treadmill effect. It will allow them to provide accessible,  good-quality, patient-focused care. The primary dental-care strategy, which was  developed with input from all stakeholders, was published in November 2006. I  have accepted that strategy as the blueprint for the new service, subject to  adequate piloting. The clauses relating to dental services in the Bill will  provide the legislative framework to deliver the new arrangements.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Dentists will receive a guaranteed regular income that will  reward them for their time rather than for the volume of work they produce.  Dentists are under no obligation to treat Health Service patients, but under  the new legislation, services will be commissioned locally to meet  requirements, and access to Health Service dental treatment will be integral to  that. The new commissioning powers given to health and social services boards  will ensure better access to Health Service dentistry and place greater emphasis  on prevention than the current contract permits. That alternative approach will  put in place a regional contract with local flexibilities that will deliver an  improved patient experience, greater clinical consistency, and clarity between  private and Health Service care.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">To improve the safety and protection of patients, the Bill  will extend the powers of the health and social services boards to allow them  to directly suspend a practitioner. That will apply to the four family-practitioner services: general  practitioners, opticians, pharmacists and dentists. Suspension could take  place, pending, for instance, referral to the Health Service tribunal, the  outcome of a court case, or a hearing by a professional regulatory body.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There will be no right of appeal against a board&rsquo;s decision  to suspend. Suspension in such circumstances will be classed as a neutral act:  not a disciplinary sanction. The intention is that the power will protect the  interests of patients, staff and the practitioner who is suspended.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Suspension is a temporary measure. It does not imply guilt  and will be a neutral act during an investigation. It will be important to a  board that the person who takes the decision to suspend a practitioner is able  to substantiate that decision. Currently a practitioner may continue to treat  patients while a court case is being decided, but boards will be able to take  fast and effective action when concerns about a practitioner are raised. The  Bill will also enable a board to allow a practitioner to practise as long as he  or she agrees to be bound by specific conditions. Those powers will now extend  to all practitioners, including locums, deputies and employees.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill also extends the powers of the Health Service  tribunal, allowing it to deal with a practitioner who has been referred because  of inappropriate professional or personal conduct, and to categories of persons  subject to the tribunal&rsquo;s jurisdiction to incorporate all practitioners,  including those who assist with the provision of services.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">This Bill as it stands includes an exemption for performers  from the smoke-free legislation. Clause 15 of the Bill would amend The Smoking  (Northern Ireland)  Order 2006 by providing a power to exempt by regulation from smoke-free  provision smoking by a performer in a  performance in which the artistic integrity of the performance makes it  appropriate to smoke. The previous Administration inserted that clause in the  original Order in Council at Westminster.  The Order was subsequently translated into the Assembly Bill that is now before  Members. To avoid any delay in introducing the Bill&rsquo;s important provisions,  which, as I have just outlined, will increase patients&rsquo; safety, I agreed that  the proposed amendment in clause 15 could  remain in the Bill at least until it could be debated in the Assembly.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have considered the  theatrical profession&rsquo;s arguments in favour of the exemption. Those  arguments were based on the premise that to outlaw actual smoking would  severely compromise a production&rsquo;s artistic integrity.  I have also listened carefully to representations from health  professionals and others on the exemption. Those representations focused  largely on concerns that such an exemption would undermine the rationale behind  the introduction of the smoke-free legislation; namely, the protection of  public health.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On the subject of artistic licence, the Lone Ranger, for  example, managed to rule the wild west without firing real bullets. Those who  have portrayed Julius Caesar on stage and screen have cause to be grateful that  the assassination scene did not require them to shed real blood for the sake of  their art. Actual smoking is not essential in order to protect the integrity of  a particular performance. Even if it were, however, the argument that artistic integrity would be compromised does  not outweigh the public-health argument. I am therefore minded to table an  amendment to the Bill to remove clause 15.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName">Some Members: Hear, hear.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr McGimpsey: I recommend the Bill to the Assembly, as  I believe that it provides the opportunity to strengthen the quality of  primary-care services in Northern    Ireland by introducing measures that will  enhance patients&rsquo; safety and will provide new arrange&shy;ments for commissioning  general dental services and contracting with general dental practitioners.  However, as I have said, I will not support the exemption to the smoke-free  legislation for performers and others.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mrs I Robinson)</strong>:  The Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill is relatively short, but it  certainly lives up to its title. One might say that it does exactly what it  says on the tin. As the Minister has already explained, the Bill contains  several separate and unconnected measures, three of which I shall deal with  briefly.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The first relates to measures aimed at enhancing public  safety that have already been implemented in England,  Scotland and Wales. As the  Minister has said, the introduction of those measures arose out of concerns  about the case of Dr Harold Shipman. Dr Shipman, as Members will know, was  jailed for life in 2000 for the murder of 15 of his patients. He was  subsequently found to have been responsible for more than 200 murders. Part of  the Bill&rsquo;s provisions seems to be aimed at ensuring that a similar case cannot  ever happen again.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have some concerns that, although those public-safety  measures were introduced in the rest of the United   Kingdom some time ago, they were not introduced in Northern Ireland  much earlier. The Bill will give health and social services boards the power to  suspend a range of family practitioners &mdash;  GPs, dentists, opticians and pharmacists &mdash; pending a hearing by a  professional regulatory body, a court case or the Health Service tribunal.  During the Committee&rsquo;s initial consideration of those provisions, some members  expressed concern that, although such a suspension by a board would be  described as a neutral act, pending the outcome of any inquiry, the public  would not perceive it as such. As a result, the good name and reputation of a  practitioner would risk being seriously and irrevocably damaged.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Other Members of the Committee may wish to elaborate on  that matter and more fully explore that concern during the Committee Stage of  the Bill.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The availability of dental services is a further concern. The relevant provisions of the Bill are  intended to give the health and social care trusts the tools to deal  with those areas where patients find it difficult to register with a Health  Service dentist. An increasing number of dentists no longer offer Health  Service treatment and provide only private dental treatment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is widely recognised that Northern   Ireland has the worst dental health in the United Kingdom,  and that has been the case for a considerable time. Last week, the Chief Medical  Officer, Dr Michael McBride, briefed the Committee for Health, Social Services  and Public Safety on public health services. His report highlights the scale of  the problem, which is particularly bad for children from the most deprived  areas of Northern Ireland.  The Committee was told that, compared to the UK average, 12-year-olds in  Northern Ireland have almost three times the level of decay for their age  group. That is an issue that can and must be tackled. I support the Health Bill  if its provisions will help in even a small way.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the decision by the Minister of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety to drop the clause that exempts performers from the  smoking ban. The Committee had not yet taken a position on that exemption, but  I had intended to highlight the strong opposition that has already been voiced  by some Committee Members during an initial briefing by the Department of  Health. Removing the exemption for performers is correct because there is no  more suitable group to provide appropriate props.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Last Thursday, during an evidence session of the Committee  for Health, Social Services and Public Safety on public health issues, the  Chief Medical Officer pointed out that the recent introduction of a smoking ban  in work places was a major step forward, but  that much more needed to be done. He also reminded us that smoking  claims the lives of approximately 2,300 people a year in Northern Ireland,  which is a damning and shocking statistic.  I welcome the smoking ban in workplaces. Any relaxation of the ban would  send the wrong message.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Commenting on the  proposed exemption for performers, the  Chief Medical Officer told the Committee:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;From a public health perspective, which is the only  perspective from which I, as Chief Medical Officer, can comment, I could not  support the introduction of such a provision.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">He also referred to dangers to the actors and audiences  involved in the performances, and the message that that would send to the wider  public. In the light of the advice from the Chief Medical Officer, I am not  surprised that the Minister of Health has rethought the matter, and that is  welcome.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">When the Department of Health undertook a public  consultation on the exemption of performers from the smoking ban earlier in the year, there were 26 responses, of  which 22 were strongly opposed to the exemption. That only four responses &mdash;  three from organisations and one from an  individual &mdash; supported the exemption makes its own case. I welcome the  Minister&rsquo;s change of heart, and his commitment to remove that clause from the  Bill at Consideration Stage. Aside from that clause, I support the general  provisions of the Bill.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Health  (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill. My comments will be made without prejudice to  the possibility of tabling an amendment at a later stage.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Members agree that transparency is good for health  professionals and their patients. There are concerns about the potential  misinterpretation of ambiguities in the legislation. Everyone agrees that  regulation is the right way forward, but the manner in which that regulation is  carried out may lead to lobbying from groups of doctors and their  representatives.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There are concerns regarding the principle of ensuring that  professional regulation and workplace regulation connect in a manner that is  respectful to distinct but complementary roles.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Doctors are working under pressure and are delivering  healthcare in difficult circumstances. However, they would welcome particular  aspects of regulation. For doctors, personal regulation is about putting patients first, which is an ethos that is  enshrined in medical practice. Team-based regulation is about the  performance of the team and risk-management strategies for patient care.  Workplace regulation is about governance and performance-management systems.  Professional regulation includes ongoing work on standards, education and  regulation licensing to include  revalidation and fitness of practice procedures. If all those items could  be included in the Bill&rsquo;s explanatory and financial memorandum, the potential  for misinterpretation would be reduced.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am delighted that the Minister is going to table an  amendment to remove clause 15 from the Bill, as the argument about artistic  integrity is not valid. I am sure that many Members have been lobbied by  various health promotion charities, such as Action Cancer and the Ulster Cancer  Foundation, and the families of people who have died as a result of disease  caused by smoking. I hope that the proposed removal of clause 15 from the Bill  is a good-news story that will be reported by the media, because it is an  action that puts the needs of people first.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am also glad that there has been adherence to the smoking  ban, and that the first opportunity for an amendment to dilute it has been  resisted.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have no major concerns with the Bill. However, as I have  said, Members will be examining it again and will be making further  representations at Committee Stage. I welcome the opportunity to comment on the  Bill, and I appreciate the remarks of the Chairperson of the Committee for  Culture, Arts and Leisure. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Robert  Coulter</strong>: I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comments regarding artistic integrity and  smoking. I cannot see the logic of keeping that particular part of the Bill,  and I am glad that the Minister has made it clear that it will not be retained.  When a precedent like that is set, through pressure from a particular section  of the community, it encourages others to seek other changes in the  legislation. I fully support the Minister&rsquo;s intention to remove the clause  relating to smoking from the Bill.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Recently, when speaking in the debate on junior doctors, I  emphasised how important it is that the medical profession regulates itself. I  am deeply suspicious of doctors being regulated by anyone other than fellow  doctors, and I will set my face against administrators regulating doctors. The  medical profession has regulated itself successfully for many hundreds of  years, with few notable exceptions.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am concerned that there are elements of the innocuously  named Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill that will undermine and dilute the  principle of self-regulation in a manner that is neither justified nor  acceptable. The Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety has  spoken about his strong support for the professionals in the Health Service and  their integrity. From my personal experience of the Minister, I know that his  support is genuine.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The failure of the Bill  to mention the widely accepted and recently reformed disciplinary  mechanisms of the General Medical Council (GMC) is difficult to explain and  could be construed in some quarters as ominous. How can a Bill that purports to  address regulatory mechanisms fail to refer  to such tried and tested devices? That seems a strange omission. To fail  to set any new regulatory mechanisms in the context of recently revised GMC  standards raises doubts as to whether the new provisions are designed to  undermine, rather than complement, existing regulations and regulatory bodies.  I know that there is considerable disquiet in the medical profession about the extension  of powers to a health and social services board to suspend a medical  practitioner before &mdash; and I repeat, before &mdash; referral to the Health Service  tribunal. The Chairperson of the Health Committee rightly said that such a  suspension would cast a shadow of doubt over that individual and would raise  concerns among those whom he has been treating. Not only that; it would cast a  doubt into the practitioner&rsquo;s mind that would prove very difficult to remove,  even if the suspension were lifted.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">No one would deny the local board the right to act in  matters of patient protection. However, not all matters are quite so clear-cut.  The provision conjures up visions of possible victimisation and has the  potential, in the wrong hands, to be misused.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We should not entertain the prospect of unilateral action  by a health and social services board without the sanction of any balancing and  medically competent counterweight. I always look closely at any new legislation  that comes before the Assembly and ask myself what is its real intention. I try  to discern the true intentions behind what is being proposed. In the case of  this Bill, the definition of the new grounds for disqualification &mdash; to be added  to those of fraud and prejudice to the efficiency of the service &mdash; lack clarity,  to my concern.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Lack of clarity could be construed as another attempt to  undermine the medical profession&rsquo;s independent standing and to subject doctors  to still further decision-making by bureaucrats. Ill-defined law is always bad  law. The Bill therefore requires further scrutiny to address the growing  concerns that many doctors and other professionals, and their professional  body, the British Medical Association (BMA), have about it. I am sure that all  MLAs will see that as the bounden duty of the House, and I look forward to the  Committee Stage of the Bill.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>: I  welcome the opportunity to comment on the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions)  Bill.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I also welcome the Minister&rsquo;s decision not to water down  the Smoking (Northern    Ireland) Order 2006. That would be to  clearly contradict and undermine the aims of the Order by putting at risk the  health of actors, stage workers and audiences. Consistency of the regulations  is essential in order that we do not send out mixed messages. Certainly, the  SDLP still believes that a total ban on smoking in all enclosed places is the  only way in which to protect all workers from the harmful effects of passive  smoking.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill also makes provision to further strengthen the  quality of primary-care services and to bring our services in line with those  in England, Wales and Scotland. I welcome the move to include all practitioners  &mdash; GPs, dentists, opticians, pharmacists, and  ophthalmic and pharmaceutical bodies &mdash; on a single list of performers of  primary medical services in each health and social services board.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Although this is not part of the Bill, it is equally  important to note that it is essential that all health professionals, and  indeed, all professionals allied to health matters, be around the table of  primary-care partnerships to ensure that a more holistic approach to healthcare  in the community is developed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Many new parents need the support and encourage&shy;ment of  midwives and others with parenting, and older people may need a podiatrist or  an occupational therapist much more than they need any other health  professional.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It has been mentioned that the proposal to extend the  powers of health and social services boards has concerned the BMA and the GMC.  Those bodies have acknowledged that patient protection is the reason behind the  argument for local suspension. I have no doubt that those concerns will have to  be taken on board. However, I believe that all practitioners should be  independently regulated, and patient safety is the bottom and top line for me.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP believes that wider access to NHS dentistry in all  areas is necessary. There should be more training places for dental hygienists  and nurses, and the working environment of NHS dental-care staff should be  improved.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The fact that many dentists have pulled out of contract  negotiations in England and Wales is  worrying for us. There must be plans to ensure that dentists are satisfied with  their contracts and will stay in the NHS in order that everyone, particularly  children and young people, can register with a National Health Service dentist.  It is frightening that the children of Northern Ireland cannot at present  be treated on the NHS. According to the British Dental Association (BDA),  children&rsquo;s teeth in Northern Ireland  are much worse than those of their contemporaries in the rest of Ireland and the UK. As NHS dental cover declines,  so does dental health, and, indeed, our poor record of dental health is  increasing. It is essential that every patient who is eligible to register can  do so. Furthermore, dentists should be local &mdash; patients should not have to  travel many miles to find a National Health Service dentist. The proposed  policy change must ensure that the health and social services boards have the  power to commission dentists. I will  certainly monitor that closely to  ensure that NHS dentists are available and that access is widened  adequately. We must ensure that we get away from the &ldquo;fill and drill&rdquo; culture  of the contracts. We must recruit and retain good dental-health staff.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr McCarthy: I am grateful for the opportunity to speak  on the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill&rsquo;s provisions on dentistry are almost replicas of  legislation that has been implemented across the water, primarily in England.  However, those have not been regarded as very successful. The legislation in England was  meant to improve access to dentistry, but the three price bands for treatment  has meant that that has not happened. The top price band of &pound;189 means that  dentists simply will not take on treatment that is worth up to &pound;900, thus those  who need dental treatment will not receive it.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The legislation in England was also meant to improve  prevention of tooth disease; however, there has been an increase in extraction  and a reduction in root treatment. The real  problem is that health spending in Northern Ireland has increased by  some 64% in the past decade, but dental spending has risen by only 22%,  resulting in a real crisis in dental services. Surely we cannot and should not  blindly follow a system that does not work.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As I understand it, the Scottish Parliament rejected  similar proposals, acknowledging that such a system would not help prevention  or access, but would only make a bad situation worse. More work is required in  that regard.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod"><span class="Italic">12.30 pm</span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My party is totally opposed to any regulation that makes it  possible to smoke in public places &mdash; even for performers  or artists, for whom I have the highest regard. It should not be beyond  the imagination or innovation of those in that business to think of a  substitute for the act of smoking.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It was agreed earlier  this year in Northern    Ireland that smoking in public places  was detrimental to the health of our people, and action was taken to put into  force measures to address that. The vast  majority of Northern Irish people have accepted that smoking is a deadly  habit. It has also been accepted that  non-smokers should not have their  lives endangered by other people&rsquo;s smoke.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Real progress has been made in Northern Ireland on the issue of smoking, and many people now  acknowledge that smoking is, and has been, detrimental to health.  Considering the efforts made by many Members of this Assembly, by local  councils across Northern    Ireland, and by organisations that are  concerned with health, it would be a real slap in the teeth to all of us and  all of those organisations if the provision to allow performers or artists to  smoke during a performance remained in the Bill.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am delighted that the  Minister has accepted the will of the  people and that he has listened to the people on that issue. I hope that the Minister throws out that  exemption. That will enable people in Northern Ireland to continue to  have a smoke-free workplace. I am glad to support the Bill.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>: It gives me particular pleasure to support the vast bulk of the Bill,  which is designed to strengthen further the quality of primary-care  services in Northern Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Prior to my election to the Assembly, I worked in the Health Service for 16 years. I had ample  opportunity to appreciate the commitment and contribution of so many  people in caring, nursing and other areas of the medical community. Those  people, unstintingly, give their time and talents in the service of those who  are ill or in need of treatment. I have often been concerned that their work has  been made more difficult by the requirement to work within restrictive  bureaucratic parameters. These particular proposals are therefore most welcome.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Patients&rsquo; safety and  patients&rsquo; confidence in the system must be major priorities. It is vital  that patients have complete confidence in the ability and experience of their  GP, dentist, pharmacist or optician, or, indeed, in anyone involved with their  examination and treatment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Experience has taught us that patients must never be left  in a position of doubt or insecurity. Where the competence of a medical  practitioner is in question, the health authority must have the ability to  conduct prompt investigations, or to impose appropriate limits and conditions.  It is better in such situations to take no risks and to err on the side of  caution, rather than to ignore concerns or to sideline a problem situation.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am also happy to support legislation to introduce  improvements in the way in which dental services are organised. No one should  be in a position where they have difficulty in accessing dental care. The  facility to allow health boards to  commission local dental services is a very sound one and has my full  support.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I cannot, however, in all conscience, support the proposed  legislation to amend the Smoking (Northern Ireland) Order 2006 in  order to permit smoking by those taking part in performances. Legislation has  been the critical factor in shaping the cultural change in community attitudes  to smoking. The vast majority of people are opposed to smoking and do not want  any watering down of the legislation. Smoking is a killer and treating those  made ill by smoking is a huge drain on our medical resources.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Members will remember  the days when having actors smoking in films was used as a subliminal  vehicle for cigar and cigarette product  placements by unscrupulous tobacco companies. If actors are required to  smoke on stage, it should be in a simulated  form only &mdash; that would be a challenge to their acting ability. There  must be no weakening in our determination to make Northern Ireland  a smoke-free country. There should be no  tinkering with the legislation, and I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s response  today.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I broadly welcome the changes proposed to prevent  discrimination on the grounds of age with regard to the retirement age for GPs  and dentists. I know of many older people working well beyond their normal  retirement age. There is no substitute for experience.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am a little concerned  that the provision for exemption from Health Service charges could be  exploited by those who are known as medical  tourists to the detriment of people in our own community. If we want to  exempt those granted leave to enter Northern Ireland  from paying for a course of treatment, or other medical services, we  must carefully monitor the situation to ensure that it is not over-exploited.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Any treatment that is given free of charge to foreign  visitors is given at the expense of those who have paid National Insurance  contributions for many years. Although all visitors should be welcomed to Northern Ireland, we should nevertheless ensure that the humani&shy;tarian  grounds in such cases are exceptional and are supported by firm evidence.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. I too welcome the opportunity to comment on the Bill at  this stage. I look forward to its coming before the Committee for Health,  Social Services and Public Safety for further scrutiny and to hearing evidence  from those who have an interest in it.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill&rsquo;s main purpose  is to introduce policy changes that are designed to strengthen the  quality of primary care services in the  North. My colleague, Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n, has  commented on concerns in respect of patients&rsquo; safety, greater accountability and the relaxation of the  smoking ban. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s decision not to relax the smoking  ban.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I will comment on dental services across the North and the proposals included in the Bill. I must  agree with the Minister on the unacceptable lack of availability of  dental services. At present there are people who cannot locate a dentist in their area with whom they can register as an  NHS patient. That cannot be allowed to continue, especially in the light of the  poor oral health of the North&rsquo;s population.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Oral health in the  North has been poor for many years, with those living in deprived areas  being most affected. It is a well-recognised factor that social deprivation has  a strong influence on dental decay. Children living in the 20% of most deprived  wards in the North are almost twice as likely to have experienced dental decay as children from the 20% of most affluent  wards.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Overall, the poor state of oral health is particularly bad in comparison to the South of Ireland and to England. The  average five-year-old child in Belfast has  approxi&shy;mately 2&middot;5 teeth affected by tooth decay, whereas a child of the same  age in London has 1&middot;5 teeth affected by tooth  decay, and a child in Dublin  has only one tooth affected by tooth decay.  Those comparisons make it ever clearer that there is a crisis in dental  services.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill will provide  the Department with the oppor&shy;tunity to commission dental services and  to directly employ dentists. That should go some way towards achieving better  outcomes. However, the Department needs to target resources to the areas of  greatest need and to encourage dentists to register and provide care for those  patients with the greatest need. That needs to be a priority for the  Department.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>: I am almost finished, if you do not mind.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, I welcome the opportunity to comment on the  Bill. However, I reserve the right to make amend&shy;ments and further comments when the Bill comes before the Health, Social Services and Public Safety  Committee.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr McCallister: I welcome the forthcoming opportunity  to review the Bill in the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public  Safety Committee and to discuss it in more  detail. I welcome the proposed changes to some of the dental services. I  also welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comment that he  will discuss those changes with dental practitioners. It is most  important that they are involved in the  process. It is also important that huge steps forward are taken in patient care, perhaps including a  long-term strategy on preventative dental care.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Other Members have highlighted the fact that we, in Northern Ireland,  lag badly behind in the provision of dental care and in preventative dental  care. The Bill also proposes changes regarding tribunals that will bring Northern Ireland into line with England. The  smoking ban has already been mentioned, I welcome the Bill&rsquo;s provisions on  that.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  is ideally placed to make judgements on the extension of the smoking ban to  cover theatres as he is a former Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure. The  most important issue regarding the extension of the ban is the message that it  sends out, as Members from all sides of the  House have welcomed it. I look forward to discussing the Bill at Committee  Stage, and I give broad support to its provisions.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr McGimpsey: I thank all of the Members who  contributed to the debate for their remarks. I shall attempt to deal with some  of the issues that were raised, and I look forward to discussion of the Bill at  the Committee Stage.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The changes to the  powers and duties of the health and social  services boards and of the tribunal will strengthen quality assurance  and improve protection of patients. A new dental contract will allow local  commissioning of a high-quality dental service that is responsive to the needs  and wishes of patients. The proposed legislation reflects the Department&rsquo;s  desire to improve primary care services for the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As I mentioned at the outset in my opening speech, the Bill  contains the clause on smoking. I am grateful for the comments of colleagues  about the smoking provision, and I assure them that, bearing in mind my  responsibility for all the people in Northern Ireland and that I was previously  the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure,  I see no reason why the recent smoking ban in public places should be  broken to permit that activity. At the Bill&rsquo;s Consideration Stage, I shall  table an amendment to withdraw that clause. The issues that follow are dealt  with in no particular order.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Local commissioning for  dentistry will be introduced to  provide for and meet the needs of the local community, and access to  Health Service dental treatment is an integral part of that. Boards will be  required to define the services that they want to commission, and that service must take the oral health needs of the  population into account. Primary  dental services must be provided, and their provision secured.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mrs Robinson made the point that that provision should have  been available earlier, and she is correct; however, apart from Orders in  Council, to which I referred, this is the first opportunity that the devolved  Assembly has had to progress the issue. The timing was under the control of the  previous Administration. Legislation on the provision of primary dental  services was set up for an Order in Council, and, as I explained, rather than  delay matters, I allowed it to come forward to  give the Assembly an opportunity to discuss it. Before devolution  resumed, the legislation was offered to me as an Order in Council, but that is  part of the old, bad ways, and I know that  the House will approve my taking  the view that it was a matter for the Assembly.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Concerning the dental  contract, dentists are currently paid  for activity, and Mrs Hanna referred to that as &ldquo;drill and fill&rdquo;. That will no longer be the case;  dentists will be paid according to  the time that they have spent. There&shy;fore, they will have more time to  advise their patients, particularly on oral health. As Mrs Robinson correctly pointed out, Northern Ireland has the worst dental health  in the UK:  we are bottom of the list. Our dental health is much worse than that of the Irish Republic.  In that important area, prevention is better than cure.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a need for more dentists, and a review, published  at the end of March 2006, contained plans to increase, as soon as possible, the  number of places in the dental workforce by at least 40 a year.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome Robert Coulter&rsquo;s support on the smoking  amendment. Moreover, he raised concerns that bureau&shy;crats are responsible for  the regulation of practitioners. That does not run against the powers of the  General Medical Council (GMC), which is still the regulatory body. Only the GMC  has the power to strike off a general practitioner.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, in the wake of the Shipman Inquiry, the Donaldson Report recognised that there is a gap  between national and local  regulations. The provision is designed to  close that gap. If there is lack of clarity, as Bob Coulter says, the process will aim to provide clarity  through the enabling powers of the Bill.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod"><span class="Italic">12.45 pm</span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Suspension is a temporary measure that is designed to  protect patients and practitioners. The statement is designed to be neutral,  and the Committee can give me its opinions on that. Suspension would occur  during an investigation, and the suspending authority must be able to justify  and substantiate such a decision. It is a double-edged  sword &mdash; a two-way situation &mdash; because the onus is on a board or tribunal  to justify exactly why it has taken an action. If the board or tribunal cannot  do that, the stigma will be on it, rather than on the practitioner.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate that  Members have raised other questions, to which I have not had time to  respond. I look forward to the Committee  Stage and to the Committee&rsquo;s deliber&shy;ations and conclusions, which will inform  the legislation as the process  progresses. I am grateful to Members who have contributed to this  helpful debate on an important piece of legislation.</p>

		    <p class="TimePeriod">2.30 pm</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has allowed up to one hour and 30 minutes  for the debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes to propose and  10 minutes for the winding-up speech. All other  Members who wish to speak will have five minutes.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Two amendments have been received and are published on the  Marshalled List. If amendment No 1 is made, amendment No 2 will fall. The  proposers of the amendments will each have 10 minutes to propose and five  minutes for winding up.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I  beg to move</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly notes that, following the McCrone Report:  &lsquo;A Teaching Profession for the 21<sup>st</sup> Century&rsquo;, a teacher induction  scheme guarantees a one-year teaching post to every student graduating from a  Scottish university with a teaching qualification; and calls upon the Minister  of Education to liaise with the Scottish Executive on this matter, with a view  to a similar scheme being introduced for teachers who train in Northern  Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am willing to accept amendment No 2, tabled by the  Members opposite for Lagan   Valley and for Mid  Ulster. Therefore, I reject the amendment tabled by the SDLP. I am somewhat  bemused by its content, as it deals with current teachers and does not seem to  address the issue at hand. Undoubtedly, Mr Bradley will elaborate on that.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the opportunity to raise the issue of teacher  induction. It is increasingly difficult for university graduates to find work,  particularly newly qualified teachers. Northern   Ireland does not have the same teacher shortages as other  regions of the United    Kingdom. Teaching courses and Postgraduate  Certificate in Education (PGCE) courses remain heavily oversubscribed, with  sometimes as many as five times more applicants than available places.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Currently, only about 22% of new teachers manage to find  work in the first year after graduation. That indicates a significant problem,  about which I have been contacted numerous times in my constituency.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Figures for 2001-02 reveal that 83&middot;4% of those recently  graduated teachers who returned destination information forms were employed as  full-time teachers six months after graduation. That figure fell to 77&middot;7% in  2002-03 and to 73&middot;7% in 2003-04. The figures reached an all-time low in  2004-05, with only 62&middot;2% of new teachers finding work.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The statistics can be misleading because many recently  qualified teachers who have not managed to find work have not returned  destination information forms. There is little doubt that the situation is  getting worse, and evidence that I have recently heard leads me to believe that  even more young people have been unable to find work in the last year. Seamus  Searson of the National Association of Schoolmasters and Union of Women  Teachers (NASUWT) suggests that that figure might be as low as 22% and that the  situation is reaching crisis point in Northern Ireland.  He also suggests that 25% of graduates have gained only temporary posts.  With that in mind, the Assembly must look at ways to help young teachers enter  the profession.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">One option, which was implemented in Scotland with the  support of the NASUWT, is to guarantee new teachers  a job for at least one year. That policy emerged from the McCrone  Report, which was welcomed by many in the profession and has met with much  praise since its implementation.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We are clearly not calling for that policy to be introduced  immediately in Northern    Ireland. We are simply asking the Minister  to liase with her Scottish counterpart and to examine whether it is a desirable  and worthwhile policy that could be introduced in Northern Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">At present, huge amounts of money are spent on training new  teachers, but once students complete their courses,  they are unable to find permanent employment in teaching. Many of those  graduates cannot find work as supply teachers because many older teachers are  taking early retirement and are doing supply work or covering for maternity  leave. It is far more attractive for principals to take on someone who has  years of experience, rather than a complete novice. Young teachers have no  experience, but how can they gain experience if no one will employ them?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Former full-time teachers are ideal candidates for supply  work; they know the job and they have the experience  that headmasters need. However, that makes it difficult for new teachers  to get started.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The age profile of current teachers is another issue to be  addressed, as well as falling pupil numbers. Added together, those  circumstances contribute to a significant problem. How can the Assembly address  the problem and get younger teachers into schools? How can graduates gain the  experience that they need if they cannot find jobs, even as supply teachers?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A guaranteed year of teaching for all new teachers is one  possible way forward. That policy has been implemented in Scotland, and  should be given serious consideration by the Assembly.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The introduction of a teacher induction year would also ensure that young teachers were not thrown  in at the deep end, but given an  individually tailored programme that built on skills that they had  already gained during their training period,  while providing a system of support. Young teachers would be mentored  and supported by experienced staff, and  principals would monitor progress to ensure that individuals received  that support.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The NASUWT and the  General Teaching Council for Northern  Ireland (GTCNI) support the idea of a teacher induction year. In its  final report for the Department of Education, the GTCNI recommended the  introduction of a guaranteed induction year for all newly qualified teachers.  The Irish National Teachers Organisation (INTO) also expressed its concerns  about losing the most talented teachers, saying that it feared that:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;our brightest and  best young teachers were to be lured across the water by an offer of &pound;5,000.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Although the guarantee of full employment would be for only  one year, it would go some way to giving a degree  of experience to student teachers. That experience would be beneficial in building a new teacher&rsquo;s  portfolio and helpful when applying for jobs.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that consideration be given to how best to  facilitate the placement of, and provide support for, new teachers. Surveys  have shown that the quality of support that teachers receive in their early  years has a major impact on their experiences as a teacher. Many young teachers have become demoralised simply  because they cannot find work. On 6  April 2005, &lsquo;The Scotsman&rsquo; reported of the McCrone report that:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;One of the greatest  achievements has been the organised system for probationer teachers in their  induction year.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">What will be the consequences if Members do not take action to help young teachers? Unlike other  regions of the United Kingdom,  Northern Ireland  is unique in not having a shortage of teachers, and, therefore, we have a  generally higher standard of teaching due to competition for places, which  results in a requirement for higher entry grades. If graduates cannot find work  in Northern Ireland they will be  forced either to abandon their chosen profession, which they have been  trained for, or to consider going to the mainland  to teach. Given that students already  get paid to undertake PGCE courses in some parts of the UK, there is a risk that many of the most talented young teachers will be forced  to leave Northern    Ireland. It is unlikely that, having settled  into a new job in a new place, they will ever return.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have already  mentioned the vast amounts of money that are spent on the training of  teachers in Northern Ireland.  Is it prudent to spend such money on teachers who ultimately head for the  mainland to find a job? Should Members not ensure that there is a return on  that investment by keeping teachers for schools in Northern Ireland?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The brain drain has  received media attention in recent months, and it is undoubtedly of  concern to Members. As with other skills, the most talented local people must  be kept and availed of in Northern    Ireland rather than elsewhere.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I was struck by the  story that the Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond told in his address  to the Assembly yesterday. He told of a man he had spoken with at Westminster who said that  he had gone south in search of work. When asked if he would return to Scotland, the  man said that he would if the opportunity were there to do so. That is the crux  of the issue. Do young teachers have the opportunity to follow their chosen  career at home, or must they leave Northern Ireland?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Members should be creating opportunities for those talented  teachers; opening doors, instead of closing them. If Members fail to do that,  the likely outcome will be that school-leavers who are enthusiastic and keen to  follow a teaching career will decide that it is in their best interests to  follow another path.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Publicity about  shortages of teaching jobs in Northern<span style="letter-spacing:0pt; "> Ireland</span> acts as a disincentive to even the keenest  students. That should not be the case. Members should be encouraging the  brightest and most enthusiastic students into that profession.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I look forward to hearing the views of Members &mdash;  particularly those who are former teachers. I refer, of course, to my esteemed  colleagues Mr Sammy Wilson and Miss Michelle McIlveen, who may have an insight  into this problem and who might elaborate on their experiences and the finer  details of the idea of having an induction year.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The introduction of an induction year might not mean that a  teacher would be guaranteed a job at the end, but it would mean that they would  at least have a fighting chance. I hope that Members will give the motion their  careful consideration and their support.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  I beg to move amendment No 1: Leave out all  after &ldquo;post&rdquo; and insert </p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;in Scotland to  every student teacher graduating from a Scottish university; further  notes the publication of the Curran report &lsquo;Improving  Conditions, Raising Standards&rsquo;, with the recommendation that a similar  induction scheme is introduced in Northern  Ireland; and calls on the Minister of Education and the Executive to  implement the recommendations of the Curran report, including those on newly  qualified teachers.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I welcome  the motion in the names of Mr Ross and Miss McIlveen. The motion seeks to give  one year&rsquo;s teaching experience to newly qualified teachers from Northern Ireland&rsquo;s teaching university colleges  and sources the historic changes that took place in Scotland after the publication of  the McCrone Report. However, in moving amendment No 1, I want to draw to the  attention of Members to two important facts that are not covered in the  original motion.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The source document for  the improvement of teachers&rsquo; conditions of service in Northern Ireland  is the Curran Report, part 1 of which was published in 2003, with part 2 being published in 2004. The independent  Curran inquiry into teachers&rsquo; salaries and conditions of service was set  up by a former Minister of Education, Martin McGuinness. The inquiry had the  unanimous support of the five recognised teachers&rsquo; unions in Northern Ireland and all the employing authorities on the manage&shy;ment  side of the teachers&rsquo; negotiating committee. Sean Curran CBE chaired the  committee, which considered developments in Scotland  under the McCrone Report and the subsequent  negotiations, as well as developments in England  and Wales,  where there are no independent negotiations but instead a schoolteachers&rsquo;  review body and a national agreement.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Significantly, the key objective of the Curran committee  was to take the best features of the Scottish and English experience and to  contextualise them in the largely small-school system in Northern Ireland.  The Curran committee of inquiry was established with almost exactly the same  terms of reference as the McCrone committee of inquiry, and it reflected best  practice in England and Wales. For  those reasons, I call on the Assembly to accept my amendment, because it  reflects the best independent judgement of an inquiry that was established by  our Department of Education and that  reported to our teachers&rsquo; negotiating committee.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased to report  that all the Curran inquiry team recommendations were accepted by the  management side, which represents the education employing authorities, and by  the Northern Ireland Teachers&rsquo; Council, which represents the unanimous view of  the five recognised trade unions.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Today&rsquo;s DUP motion is worthy, but I am sure that that party  would accept that its recommendation is also one  of the key recommendations of the Curran committee of inquiry. The SDLP  agrees with the Member who moved the motion that newly qualified teachers need  one year of guaranteed employment. A complex range of factors combine to ensure that most of those teachers, in the first year after graduation, do not secure  permanent teaching posts and are therefore unable to complete their  professional teaching induction qualification. That is disastrous. Our schools  and pupils need these young enthusiastic teachers, and the teachers need to  complete their teaching qualifications. As Mr Ross said, it is a vicious  circle.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I therefore call on the  Member who moved the motion to accept that the motion&rsquo;s objective  already forms the basis of a key recommendation of the independent Curran  committee of inquiry. The motion, and the Curran recommendation, must be  implemented as soon as possible, and my amendment would facilitate that.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">What happened to the Curran committee of inquiry and all its recommendations? The inquiry team  comprised distinguished persons, many of whom had long years of  experience in education. The independent Curran inquiry into teachers&rsquo; pay and conditions was established in the  final days of the Assembly&rsquo;s first mandate, and the implementation of the  recommendations fell to successive direct rule Ministers with responsibility  for education, the first of whom was Barry Gardiner. The rules of the House do  not allow me to elaborate on the description of him that readily comes to mind.  In any case, all the Curran recommendations, including the important  recommendation to guarantee one year&rsquo;s permanent employment to all newly  qualified teachers in Northern Ireland,  were left hanging in the wilderness because the direct rule Ministers  were not prepared to seek the resources to implement them. I hope that our  devolved Ministers will not leave themselves open to the same accusation.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The proposal to introduce an induction scheme for newly  qualified teachers has been discussed in detail by the joint working party of  the teachers&rsquo; negotiating committee. A  business case for the phased implementation of the scheme, which was  unanimously agreed by management and the teachers&rsquo; unions, has been presented  to the Minister of Education. Why should the Assembly refer to the Scottish  experience when we are already moving towards implementation?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I call on the Minister of Education to implement the scheme  and relieve school principals of the pressures and the intolerable workloads  that they have endured for too long. Pupils from largely rural communities  would benefit enormously from the scheme proposed in this admirable motion.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that the  Assembly unanimously supports assistance for newly qualified teachers.  However, it should also be noted that a range of significant recommendations  made in the Curran Report were placed  in limbo under direct rule, such as the implementation of planning, preparation  and assessment time &mdash; a proposal that became  a statutory condition of service for every teacher in England and Wales  on 1 September 2005 &mdash; and the provision of two days&rsquo; administration time for  every teaching principal in small schools across Northern Ireland. Those  innovations would be a boon to teaching principals, their pupils and the  largely rural communities served by their schools.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Leading education  administrators have been working for  more than 20 years to achieve those aims, and the case is unanswerable.  The trade unions and the management side  have prioritised the proposal and have put a business case to the  Minister of Education. The SDLP wants the Minister to enact the Curran  recommendations.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My amendment calls on the Assembly to recognise that Northern Ireland  has already established a high-powered committee of inquiry under S&eacute;an Curran&rsquo;s  leadership, which has made detailed recommendations, including specific proposals  relating to newly qualified teachers. The Curran Report is available on the  Department of Education&rsquo;s website and those of the various employing  authorities and teachers&rsquo; unions in Northern Ireland.  There should be no more dithering: the recommendations of the Curran Report  must be implemented, and to that end, I am pleased to move my amendment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Under the Good Friday Agreement, the Assembly is  responsible for teachers&rsquo; salaries and conditions of service in Northern Ireland.  What better way to implement that mandate responsibly than by accepting my  amendment and adopting all the recommendations of the Curran Report, which  would end the dithering that was the hallmark of direct rule Ministers.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The DUP motion is worthy; we have the Curran Report with its  set of recommendations, and the teachers&rsquo; unions and the employers have already  presented a case to the Minister of Education and her Department. Why should we  delay all of that by referring to the Scottish experience? We have already  learned from the Scottish experience, and from the experiences of the English  and Welsh education sectors. The sum total of that experience and best practice  is reflected in the Curran Report. I ask the House to support my amendment to  the motion. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Butler</strong>: I  beg to move amendment No 2: Leave out all after the third &ldquo;to&rdquo; and insert</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;asking the Executive  to consider the matter in the context of the Comprehensive Spending Review, and  in light of other budgetary pressures facing the Executive.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank Mr Ross and Members of the House for  accepting my amendment, which represents a more sensible approach to  teacher induction.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the spirit of the motion, because there have been  a lot of positive developments for newly trained teachers in Scotland  arising out of the McCrone Report.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is generally accepted that the McCrone Report has been  good for the teaching profession in Scotland and has led to an increase  in teachers&rsquo; salaries. The teacher induction scheme mentioned in the motion  puts great emphasis on continuing professional development for teachers. The  scheme in Scotland  has produced an increase in support staff.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There are obvious concerns for new teachers, such as the lack of guaranteed employment after the  one-year induction period. Probationary teachers will have to compete in  the job market against other applicants. That said, the McCrone Report has been  good for the teaching profession, and the Assembly could learn much from it.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  From his comments, am I now to assume that Mr Butler disowns the report  initiated by his colleague, Martin McGuinness, the Minister for Education in  the former Assembly?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Butler</strong>: I  am addressing the motion before the House, which concerns the McCrone Report  and teacher induction schemes.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Teachers in the North of Ireland are finishing their  training without a proper induction period. We must also accept the reality  that school rolls have fallen, with 50,000 empty desks across the country.  There has been an overproduction of teachers. For example, at St Mary&rsquo;s University College  and Stranmillis University College,  the number of places on teaching courses has been limited. The subject of the  motion should be considered in that context.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Does the Member accept that, if he has read the very fine report by Mr Curran,  the number of newly qualified teachers has  been falling since 1978? At that time, there were 1,000 new teachers,  75% of whom were in permanent employment. The extensive literature on the matter shows that, by 1996, the number of new  teachers had fallen to 782, with only 34% in permanent employment. Those issues  have been properly and thoroughly dealt with already, and there is no need to  go over the same ground.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Butler: I thank  the Member for Lagan   Valley for that  piece of information.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A structured approach to graduate teachers is needed and, alongside that, the money to implement the  proposal in the motion. That is where Sinn Fein&rsquo;s amendment is relevant.  The Executive should consider the proposal in the context of the comprehensive  spending review. The Department of Education has estimated that the cost of  implementing the proposal in its first year to be around &pound;12 million.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We must recognise that the teaching profession here is  organised differently than in Scotland.  Furthermore, the Scottish Parliament is far more advanced than this Assembly,  not least in the area of economic decision-making and the ability of the  Scottish Executive to set their own priorities. This Assembly is less than two  months old and, although I am all for setting the Assembly ambitious targets,  we must be realistic about what we can achieve. For that reason, I ask the  House to support the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment to  the motion. I acknow&shy;ledge that the Member who proposed the motion  has accepted it. It is prudent to await the  outcome of the comprehensive  spending review, rather than set priorities that cannot be met.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The issue of teaching principals, and whether they should  work all week or possibly three days a week, has  been raised with the unions and needs to be addressed further. Dominic  Bradley mentioned the time required by teaching principals for planning,  preparation and assessment. Teachers in Great Britain devote 10% of their  time to those tasks. It must also be recognised that, according to the Department of Education, 90% of teachers  here find gainful employment after graduating from teacher-training college.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr B McCrea: I am pleased to address the House on this  important issue. As the House will know, my party included a commitment to a  guaranteed induction year for teachers in its election manifesto, and my party  takes the matter very seriously.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am somewhat surprised  by amendment No 2. During the debate  on the Second Stage of the Libraries Bill this morning, I thought that I  heard parties on the opposite Benches deciding that money was not an issue and  that if something is the right thing to do it should be done.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I fail to understand  why &mdash; now that we are debating education, rather than libraries &mdash; Sinn  F&eacute;in feels that that argument no longer  applies. Furthermore, Mr Butler stressed that Scotland  is not the same as Northern Ireland,  and neither is England or Wales.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I take the point that my hon Friend Mr Bradley made, which  was that, if we have done all the work, why should we attempt to reinvent the  wheel? Why should we consider the Scottish experience? The situation is  different there. I accept, however, that there are lessons to be learned from Scotland, and  the Curran Report has taken those on board.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In Glasgow,  the biggest problem that the authorities face is that there are far too many  qualified teachers. The authorities have to offer those teachers incentives and bonuses to teach in areas outside Glasgow. However,  barely 30 miles down the road, in more rural areas, the authorities find it  difficult to attract teachers because teachers do not want to work in those  areas.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Perhaps the situation in Glasgow is understandable, but it is not the same as the situation here. In  fact, one of the big questions in Scotland lies in the fact that, despite  its producing lots and lots of teachers,  the authorities do not know where they go. That is their big question:  &ldquo;Where are all the teachers that we trained?&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">To reiterate the  point about differences, paragraph 79 of the Curran Report states that:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;There is a problem  with teacher retention in Northern    Ireland. It is unlike the situation in England and  Wales where there is a problem in retaining young teachers.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, the set-up in England  and Wales  is completely different to ours.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">People often ask why there are so many premature  retirements from the teaching profession. Is it because of stress? Is it  because of the workload? If it is for either of those reasons, we ought to find  a way to employ more teachers. Another situation that is addressed in the  Curran Report is the question of why teachers are allowed to retire early, only  to come back to work as substitute teachers. That seems to be counter-intuitive.  Allowing such a practice does not seem to give younger teachers any  opportunities.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I was struck by an issue that we discussed yesterday when the Minister responded to questions put by  myself and members of the Alliance Party. We raised the issue that, in Northern Ireland, there are, apparently,  50,000 empty desks. What impact does that have on teacher training? Members are  agreed that numeracy and literacy are among  the highest priorities. Why, therefore, can the resource that we are  producing &mdash; surplus qualified teachers &mdash; not be used to deal with the very  important issue of those empty desks?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Why can we not agree that that is a prime problem, and use those people to solve it? All parties  have agreed that that is a problem,  and every year that we delay blights someone&rsquo;s life. That is not  contentious; the Assembly has agreed on that issue. We must take action now.  There is too much prevarication and talk of pushing the matter back. The people  of this country elected us to do something, not to commission more reports.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">This is a strategic decision. The subject of today&rsquo;s motion  has been debated time and again. We merely talk about solving the issue before  bouncing our decision back to the Executive to see whether we can afford the  solution. What, therefore, is the purpose of the rest of us, who are not in the  Executive, talking about these matters? If we are only here to rubber-stamp  decisions, if we have no voice, if we are not important, why waste taxpayers&rsquo;  money by being here? The Assembly should be making decisions, giving guidance  to the Executive and demanding action.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Unionist Party supports amendment No 1 and  rejects amendment No 2.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: The  timing of today&rsquo;s debate is welcome because it addresses a matter that is of  significant importance to many young people in Northern Ireland and to their  families.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As student teachers approach their graduations, too many of  them face the future with no certainty of jobs ahead.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">3.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I can remember conducting interviews, as a member of a  board of governors, a few years ago on 30 June for a post that was to be taken  up on 1 September. More than 50 applicants &mdash;  all girls, as it happened &mdash; applied for that junior primary school post.  They were all leaving college and at that stage, apart from a small number who  dropped out of the process, they had no prospect of employment in the  profession for which they trained. Clearly, that is a significant issue that we  need to address.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, as when we considered the employment and training  prospects of junior doctors a few weeks ago, we must also bear it in mind that  we do not need a short-term, one-year fix but something that ensures a degree  of continuity and provides some career progression. It is questionable whether  the scheme currently operating in Scotland  is necessarily what we need in Northern    Ireland. Indeed, the Scottish scheme may not  be applicable at all because the demographics are quite different here. I  certainly do not wish to oppose the sentiments of the motion, but we must be  extremely careful about the fine detail of what is proposed. If we want to  ensure that we provide for those teachers who aspire to a career that lasts a  considerable number of years &mdash; rather than until early retirement &mdash; we need  something more than just the one-year fix that the motion is in danger of  leading us to. Therefore, let us send a message to the Executive that we want  the potential for such a scheme to be explored while recognising that the  scheme that the McCrone Report laid out for Scotland  may not be entirely relevant to Northern    Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Does the Member accept that, if we introduced 10% planning, preparation and  assessment time and two days&rsquo; administration time for every teaching principal,  newly qualified teachers would benefit from that? That would mean that we would  provide not just a short-term fix but more employment on a longer-term basis  for newly qualified teachers.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Ford: The Member makes, more eloquently than I hoped  to do, a similar point to the one that I was about to make on the issue of class  sizes. In discussing our priorities for education funding, it may well be that  we conclude that additional posts will need to be created if we are seriously  to address the problem of class sizes in some of our schools, especially those  in which we are trying to mainstream pupils with special needs. The need to  reduce class sizes might provide opportunities, as might the need to provide  suitable relief for teaching principals in the way that the Member has  highlighted.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Unless we provide such opportunities, however, we will need  to face the issue that we currently train too many teachers. Indeed, despite  the statistics that Mr Basil McCrea quoted that show a reduction in the <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt; ">number of people being trained, an increasing  proportio</span>n of the students still do not have long-term employment at the  end of their course. We need to ensure that we go beyond the one-year,  short-term arrangement that is <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; ">proposed and  consider the details of the issue. It is rather</span> sad that, as I  understand it, those who are training for teaching posts in Stranmillis University  College and St Mary&rsquo;s University College are encouraged to develop other  skills because of the threat that they might not secure a job in teaching. We  need to be rather more careful than the motion suggests that any proposed <span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; ">scheme should suit the needs of Northern Ireland  rathe</span>r than be based too closely on the Scottish one.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We also need to ensure that we have the money to <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt; ">deliver. If we do not have the money to deliver  reductions</span> in class sizes, we will  not be able to go down that route. That prompts the question that other  Members have raised about the spare  capacity of 50,000 school places. There is an urgent need to rationalise  the school estate to ensure that money goes to employing teachers and providing  for the needs of pupils rather than to main&shy;taining buildings and bureaucrats.  I suspect that the Minister of Finance and Personnel, who is the deputy leader  of the party to which the proposer of the motion belongs, will be grateful for  the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment because, as Mr Butler highlighted, it would be  dangerous to adopt the proposal without ensuring that matters have been fully  costed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We also need to ensure  that, overall, there is a balance in  the teaching profession. We have heard talk of teachers leaving early  because of stress. The reality is that an apparently ever increasing number of  teachers do not continue in work until the normal retirement age because of the  difficulties that they experience. The danger is that we could end up with a  scheme that artificially gives jobs to young teachers at the expense of mature  teachers. That issue needs to be addressed.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  I find it disappointing that a motion to help newly qualified teachers who have  invested so much in their education is now being hijacked by SDLP Members, who  have taken us down a cul-de-sac by referring to a report that is of little  relevance to what we are concentrating on today.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, Mr McCrea&rsquo;s comments confused me somewhat. I  thought that his party was represented in the Executive.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley:</strong> Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen:</strong> No, I do not have much time.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I can speak on this  subject from a personal perspective. I was once a young teaching  graduate fresh out of Queen&rsquo;s University and filled with great ideals of educating, and I was fortunate in obtaining employment  early in my probation period. However, many  colleagues from my postgraduate certificate in education course &mdash;  competent people with a huge amount to offer the education system &mdash; fell by the  wayside. Indeed, I found myself employed alongside Mr Sammy Wilson in my first  teaching job, and now, in my new post, I find that the same Sammy Wilson is the  Chairman of the Committee for Education.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Northern Ireland faces a problem as a result of falling  pupil numbers. A surplus of newly qualified teachers is currently unemployed.  Around 370 newly qualified teachers emerge from Stranmillis  University College,  Queen&rsquo;s University, the University of Ulster and St Mary&rsquo;s University College  each year. According to figures released in 2004-05, only 62&middot;5% of graduates  were employed as full-time teachers six months after graduation. For Members  whose mental arithmetic is not up to  scratch, that represents 138 teaching graduates who are still not in  employment six months after graduating. Those figures are conservative, but  they show that Northern Ireland has a pool  of teaching talent that is going to waste as supply teachers, engaged in  alternative employment away from teaching, or, increasingly, applying for  teaching jobs in other parts of the United Kingdom.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is a further problem. The teaching talent that remain  in Northern Ireland  and attempt to establish themselves in such a competitive area face  difficulties in adequately completing their induction period. Five competencies  must be satisfied within that period: understanding of the curriculum and  professional knowledge; subject knowledge and subject application; teaching  strategies and techniques and classroom management; assessment and recording of  pupils&rsquo; progress; and foundation for further professional development. If  full-time employment is not available, how will it be possible to attain those  competencies to an appropriate professional standard?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Under the current scheme, induction can be started if the  newly qualified teacher is working as a supply teacher, or is employed on a  short-term contract. If an inductee moves from school to school, perhaps works  a week here and a week there, or is in different schools on different days, it  seems highly improbable that any of the competencies would be satisfied.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, under the current induction scheme there  should be a teacher tutor. That person would be responsible for monitoring,  supporting and assessing the inductee. One must wonder how someone moving from  job to job throughout a year could be properly monitored, supported or  assessed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion proposes that the Minister of Education should  liaise with the Scottish Executive in order that a scheme, similar to that in Scotland,  could be introduced in Northern Ireland.  In Scotland, inductees are guaranteed a  one-year training post, a maximum class commitment of 70% of a full-time  equivalent, dedicated time set aside for  professional development, a nominated mentor and a salary of around  &pound;19,500 a year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Obviously, Northern Ireland  and Scotland  have different education systems. While Northern   Ireland has no shortage subjects, Scotland has a  number of more remote areas where teachers are required. Valuable information  could be gathered from our near neighbours on that innovative and successful  scheme that could be applied to Northern    Ireland, with a view to improving our  current situation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, such a scheme is not cheap. The induction scheme  in Scotland  costs around &pound;24 million a year, and  involves around 2,730 inductees. I am not suggesting that we are  required to spend that amount of money, but surely, if the Minister, and her  Department, were to do some creative thinking, and take into consideration the  colossal amount of &pound;45 million that was spent on supply teachers in 2006-07  alone, something could be done. We must remember that, in return for such  investment, we will have teachers who will have a full year&rsquo;s experience, who  will be properly mentored and assessed and who will be suitably prepared to  enter the job market &mdash; a much more attractive employment proposition than the  current situation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is vital for Northern Ireland  to have a high standard of teaching talent, with relevant and  appropriate post-qualification training, to tackle the continuing challenges of  literacy and numeracy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In supporting the motion, I ask the Minister to liaise with  the Scottish Executive to establish a best-practice model for Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker:</strong> I congratulate the Member on  retaining her sanity, having served under Mr Wilson.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson:</strong> Perhaps I also have suffered under Sammy  Wilson, so my sanity is up for grabs as well.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I should like to preface my remarks by thanking the Members  who have brought this important issue before the House, and by declaring an  interest by virtue of my role as a governor at two Newtownabbey  schools.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The topic of the debate highlights not only how the  Scottish Administration can address fundamental flaws in the field of  education, but also how the community in Northern Ireland has drifted under the  dead hand of a succession of direct rule  Ministers. The NIO continues to churn  out trainee teachers from four institutions while simultaneously  overseeing other education bodies that are  engaged in closing and amalgamating schools. What sort of coherent  manpower planning does that suggest?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We require the highest level of entry qualifications from  our young teachers of any part of these islands, yet when they emerge with  their qualifications after extensive training and a considerable cost to the  public purse, we fail to provide them with opportunities to practice their craft. We produce the best young  teachers in the UK,  so it is small wonder that when we fail to employ them here, they are snapped  up with glee by education authorities across the UK and beyond. At the weekend, I  heard of one going to the Gulf after a telephone interview.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">This is another glaring example of the brain drain that has  so afflicted Northern    Ireland under direct rule. McCrone&rsquo;s report  on the difficulties encountered by Scottish teachers going through their  induction process is worthy of note, and  could be adapted to suit conditions in Northern Ireland. It is but one  example of how the Scottish Executive are seeking to seriously address the  shortcomings of the Scottish education system.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Other elements are designed to improve standards. They  include a substantial pay rise to attract and retain teachers; improvements to  their conditions of service; and a commitment to reduce class sizes and deal  with disruptive pupils. All of those approaches indicate a co-ordinated drive  to put in place a system that can provide  the skills required to develop a knowledge-based economy. We cannot do this on the cheap. If we are going to invest in education &mdash; if we want a  knowledge-based economy &mdash; the money has to go in now.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">This lesson must be grasped by the Department of Education.  No amount of Celtic mythology from the Minister can be allowed to mask the fact  that her Department is failing young teachers. The present trend for isolated  days of temporary teaching, spread over several schools and many months, is not  the best way to ensure that they complete  their induction process in a  coherent, cohesive and consistent manner. The best way to ensure that  the desired high standards are consistently reached is for new teachers to be  under the constant tutelage of experienced mentors. This critical stage of teacher development, and the subsequent  stages of early professional development, require a more <span style="letter-spacing:-.25pt; ">stringent process of standardisation than can be  adequately</span> achieved under the present approach.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The McCrone Report has lessons for all of us in its  attempts to bring stability and order to the induction year by providing a  one-year window of opportunity for new entrants to the profession. However, it  does not fully address the issue of teacher employment after that initial year,  although the Scots are now moving towards a more realistic pupil-teacher ratio,  which should provide more teaching posts and enable them to focus on the core  issue of raising the level of basic literacy and numeracy skills in their  primary schools.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of  Education&rsquo;s approach of producing time-limited, ring-fenced, bolt-on  initiatives to tackle specific problems must end. The current policy means  that, once improvement has occurred, funding is promptly removed from the  schools in question. The end result is that any progress that has been achieved  is eroded, thereby leading to greater disillusionment for pupils and teachers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department should  instead form a task force, with young, post-induction teachers assigned  specifically to those schools wrestling with literacy and numeracy problems. In such a scenario, the young teachers  can learn their craft from the more  mature staff members who are currently being burnt out by having to cope  with impossible burdens. It would also help to reduce the sickness levels among teachers that were reported  recently.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The impact of such groups would be beneficial to both sets of teachers and to those pupils who  most need to be enthused by  education. Let us now match the needs of our education system with the  children it seeks to serve through adequate numbers of properly trained, professionally inducted and enthusiastic young  teachers. Perhaps then we will achieve a competent and cost-effective  system upon which to build the knowledge-based economy that we all aspire to  see in place.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I support both the motion and amendment No 2, and I commend my  colleagues for bringing the matter to the attention of the House.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There will always be  dissatisfaction when substantial investment is made from the public  purse towards the education and training of  individuals who then choose to ply their trade outside Northern Ireland,  although there will always be cases that are entirely understandable. We must  accept that individuals may move overseas or change occupation as a result of  wedlock. We cannot disallow people from travelling and choosing to live elsewhere. However, it is essential that we do  not operate policies that encourage people to leave Northern Irela<span style="letter-spacing:0pt; ">nd</span>. I trust that we have left those days behind, and  that no Member will encourage that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I speak not only of the teaching profession, for this issue  has implications for the Health Service and for many professions in Northern Ireland.  We must ensure that training, recruitment and retention practices are appropriate and effective, particularly in view  of growing competition from other parts of the world for talented  graduates from the Province.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The number of training posts in all professions must match  the demand in the workplace. We cannot afford to train too many teachers for  the available full-time posts, particularly given the fall in pupil numbers  predicted for the coming year, which has already been referred to.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Perhaps, since the Minister is present, she will tell us  the average cost to the public purse of training a student teacher in Northern Ireland.  It must be soul-destroying for young people in this part of the United Kingdom  to put so much work into studying, only to find that they cannot obtain a job  in Northern Ireland &mdash; the very place where they want to work.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Substantial numbers of newly trained teachers leave for England and Scotland each year. At their age,  many will not return to live here.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For those teachers, it  must be infuriating to see older, retired  teachers, supplementing a healthy pension, through being employed by  schools on a short-term basis.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  Will the Minister agree that, sometimes, principals of primary schools, when  faced with disruptive pupils, have no alternative but to bring in experienced  teachers for their prowess in discipline, rather than employ younger teachers,  even though they may wish to do so?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  thank the Member for elevating me to the position of Minister; I thought that I  was but a humble Member of the Assembly. However, given that the Member&rsquo;s party  colleague Mr McCrea referred to his commitment to a pledge in an election  manifesto, delusion may exist in the Ulster Unionist Party in many spheres.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea:</strong> Since  the Member discusses facts and figures, will he comment on the &lsquo;House of  Commons Committee of Public Accounts: The management of substitution cover for  teachers: Twenty-seventh Report of Session, 2002-03&rsquo;, which includes  suggestions on how we might better manage the supply and demand of teachers? We  have failed absolutely to achieve that. Should that not be raised with the  Minister?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  thank the Member for his intervention. Since the DUP has control of the  finances of Northern Ireland,  it will have no difficulty in ensuring that the Executive&rsquo;s duties will be exercised prudently. We need no lectures from the Member: to date, his party&rsquo;s  policies have failed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, it is infuriating for newly trained teachers to  see schools resort to the temporary employment of retired teachers. I accept  the point made earlier. A principal running a school is in an unenviable  position, for he must satisfy ever-increasing demands.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members must ensure that the spirit of the motion is preserved. The SDLP spokesman took us down a cul-de-sac to divert Members from the motion. He failed to understand that the  motion reads:<strong><span style="font-size:12.0pt; "> </span></strong></p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;That this Assembly notes &hellip;  the McCrone Report &hellip; and calls upon the Minister of Education to liaise with  the Scottish Executive&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I fail to see, therefore, how &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr D Bradley: Does the Member not recognise that the  Curran Report already encapsulates all those issues and contextualises them in the Northern Ireland situation? That is not taking a trip down a cul-de-sac; it  is travelling straight up the main road towards the objective.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  thank the Member for his intervention.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I shall conclude by quoting from the Audit Scotland report,  &lsquo;A mid-term report: A first stage review of the cost and implementation of the  teachers&rsquo; agreement &mdash; A Teaching Profession for the 21<sup>st</sup> Century&rsquo;.  The report stated that the induction year:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;has successfully  addressed the significant weaknesses in previous induction and support  arrangements &hellip; It is well-regarded by those involved and has been particularly  successful in reducing the length of the probation period, increasing training  and development opportunities for probationers and increasing entry to the  system from university to probation.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker:</strong> After the Member&rsquo;s brief elevation,  I am glad that he has acknowledged that he had every right to be humble. <em>[Laughter.]</em></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister:</strong> It is vital that the House has an opportunity to debate this important matter. Many  issues have been raised. My colleague Mr Ken Robinson talked about  building a knowledge-based economy. Of course we must to do that, and schools  are the place to start. It is important to get teacher training right and for  teachers to have a year&rsquo;s mentored experience in schools so that they can have  some consistency.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Miss McIlveen is an excellent example of someone who has  been mentored throughout school and into the Assembly &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea:</strong> And beyond.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister:</strong> And beyond. However, I should point out  that Mr Wilson&rsquo;s control has started to slip. It was refreshing to see that Mr  Wilson was not afraid to get stuck into his own Minister this morning, whereas  Miss McIlveen wishes to protect the DUP party line that the Minister of Finance  and Personnel controls everything.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Miss McIlveen certainly missed Basil McCrea&rsquo;s point that  money was suddenly not an issue for Sinn F&eacute;in during this morning&rsquo;s debate on  the Libraries Bill. More cynical people than I might note &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson:</strong> The Minister was converted by my argument.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister:</strong> As many of us have been.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">[Laughter.]</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If Mr Wilson wants to call on the Minister of Culture, Arts  and Leisure to resign, we will be happy to support him.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Money was not an issue for Sinn F&eacute;in this morning. Yet,  when a Sinn F&eacute;in Minister is involved, Sinn F&eacute;in Members all cuddle around and  try to get the DUP on board. Suddenly, money is the big issue. However, the  real issue, as my colleagues have said, is the need to introduce a better, more  focused, system of training.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Preparation time for  full-time teachers was discussed.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  The Member has raised an important point, which was also raised by some of my  colleagues on this side of the Chamber. Preparation time is absolutely  essential. We have talked about giving young teachers proper inductions and  quality training time. However, it is equally important that teachers who are  already in post have good quality preparation time at their disposal as well. Otherwise,  how can the level of expertise and content of their lessons be quantified?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister:</strong> I could not agree more, and I am sure the rest of the House also agrees with the  Member.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Preparation time is vital. The teacher induction scheme  could improve teachers&rsquo; lives in a range of areas; it could boost morale in the  teaching profession and, of course, could reduce the burden on principals. This  is a vital issue, and it is incumbent on all of us to support the proposals.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea:</strong> I wonder whether the Member supports the  recommendation at paragraph 78 of the Curran Report &mdash; a report commissioned by  the then Minister of Education, Martin McGuinness &mdash; that:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&nbsp;&ldquo;A support scheme should be introduced to assist  unemployed [newly qualified teachers], in the first year after  qualification, to have a guaranteed full-time teaching post and this should be  in place by September 2005.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  And, nearly two years later, nothing has happened.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  It does not appear to be important.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister:</strong> Well, shame on those responsible. I do  not know whether the DUP Members have read that report.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea:</strong> I do not think that they have.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister:</strong> Well, perhaps the Member could read it  for them.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Or they could ask Sinn Fein.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson:</strong> Can I have a copy of the Member&rsquo;s speech?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I am happy to give the Member a copy of the speech. I do not have a problem  with that, as long as somebody can read it out for him.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  Can the Member tell the House if he knows at what time on Fridays the Ministers  queue up outside Peter Robinson&rsquo;s office to get their pocket money and to tell  him what money they need for the next week?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister:</strong> I  cannot, but I will get some research done to see if I can find the  answer.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On a more serious note, I support the motion and the  amendment.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Education (Ms Ruane):</strong> Go raibh maith  agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Perhaps John should join us all in the group  huddle. He is obviously feeling very excluded from it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht ar an cheist  t&aacute;bhachtach seo. Sa tr&eacute;imhse ghairid seo dom i m&rsquo;Aire, t&aacute; ardchaighde&aacute;n, chomh  maith le tiomantas agus gairmi&uacute;lacht, &aacute;r m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; feicthe agam ar l&aacute;thair na  hoibre.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I would like to pay tribute to the professionalism of our  teachers. They do a tremendous job, and I wish to give them every possible  support. We are fortunate in that we continue to attract large numbers of very  able and very professional young people.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As I have said before, we need to sustain the conditions in  which we have confident, articulate and creative young adults coming out of the  school system, many wanting to be teachers. The 2005 report from the  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Develop&shy;ment, &lsquo;Teachers Matter:  Attracting, Developing and Retaining  Effective Teachers&rsquo;, points out that improving the efficiency and equity  of schooling depends in large measure on ensuring that competent people want to  become teachers, that their teaching is of high quality, and that all students have access to high-quality  teaching.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As the most significant  and costly resource in schools, teachers are central to school  improvements. In other words, teachers are central to the quality of education  and, increasingly, social outcomes. The demands on schools and teachers from  society and from parents are becoming more complex. Schools are now expected to  deal effectively with students from different ethnic backgrounds; to be sensitive to culture and gender issues; to promote tolerance and social cohesion; and to  respond effectively to the learning needs of disadvantaged students.  This is a considerable set of expectations.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The 2007 teaching award  ceremony at the Waterfront Hall yesterday provided an opportunity to  recognise and celebrate the important role that teachers play in the  development of young people in the North. I am sure that all my colleagues will  want to join me in congratulating all the award winners.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the past few weeks, I have met many educationalists and  education stakeholders to hear their concerns, ideas and thoughts. I have also attended a number of  important conferences. By listening  to people on the ground, I get a real sense of the key problems facing  the education system. I am very keen to  listen to the views of everyone with  an interest in education, and I include the Education Committee in that.</p>
	      <p class="B3SpeakerinChair" style="margin-top:6.4pt;margin-right:14.15pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;margin-left:14.15pt;">(Mr Deputy Speaker  [Mr Dallat] in the Chair)</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Yesterday &mdash; and I welcome Michelle McIlveen&rsquo;s comments &mdash; I  met Alex Salmond, the recently elected First  Minister of Scotland. We had dinner at the request of the First and  Deputy First Ministers, and we agreed that  it would be useful if I met Fiona Hyslop, Scotland&rsquo;s Cabinet  Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning, to discuss a range of  educational matters, including the education of teachers. Scotland has  only one Minister for education. I spoke to Reg Empey this morning, and this is  something in which he is interested. So I agree with what Michelle said about  learning from Scotland.  We need to.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to the motion in the names of Alastair Ross and  Michelle McIlveen, issues relating to teacher supply are complex. There is no  point in pretending otherwise; and I welcome Mervyn Storey&rsquo;s comments on that.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>: I will in a few minutes, Basil. Let me get going on my  argument first. Members know that while some  young teachers find it difficult to get full-time jobs, they may secure  some temporary part-time teaching. The higher education statistics agency  (HESA) collects information on student destinations through the destinations of  leavers from higher education survey (DLHE),  which is conducted six months after graduation. The latest available  HESA data refers to the 2004-05 academic year. It shows that of those students  who returned destination information and had gained initial teacher training  qualifications in the higher education institutions in the North of Ireland in  that year, 85% were employed as teaching professionals and 62&middot;6% as full-time  teachers six months after graduation. Figures obtained from the Department of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment for April 2007 show that 258 jobseeker allowance claimants specified teaching as the  occupation sought, and 53 of those claimants were underage. I do not  know where Basil McCrea got his figure of 50,000, but I respectfully suggest  that it was the wrong figure. Perhaps, he was referring to the substitute  register, which has over 5,000 names. I suggest that Basil revisits his  figures.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea:</strong> Will the Minister give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane:</strong> I will give way to Basil if he tells me what  the 50,000 refers to. I look forward to that.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea:</strong> I will deal with that, Minister. You know  that we try in the cut and thrust of things. There are plenty of Ministers round here apparently &mdash; at least there  were, although I see that one of them has left.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I mentioned the 50,000 empty desks in schools across the  country due to the fall in school registers. Mr Deputy Speaker, I know that I  sound slightly jokey, but my question is serious: does the Minister accept the Curran Report? I got my information from that  report, and it contained some  recommendations. Furthermore, if I could be cheeky, is it the Education  Minister or the Finance Minister who runs education policy?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane:</strong> I will answer Basil McCrea&rsquo;s first question  in the course of my speech. To the second: the Member knows I am the Minister  of Education, but the Executive work jointly to make decisions; we are a team.  Perhaps that has been lost on the UUP Benches.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mervyn Storey asked about the cost of training teachers. It  varies by institution and type of training, but I require further information  from the Department for Employment and Learning on that subject, and I will  give Mr Storey a written response.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Other Members raised important issues. There is a shortage  of teachers in such subjects as Irish language and mathematics. The direct  matching of supply and demand is difficult given that young people make their  own choices of specialisms and sectors. Demography is an important factor in  that area. Pupil numbers have declined from almost 347,000 in 2001-02 to almost  333,000 in 2005-06. In the same period, the full-time equivalent teacher count  dropped by just over 1,000. It is the Department&rsquo;s understanding that numbers  will continue to fall over the next five years. Demography and those falling  numbers are a huge problem for our education system, and the continuing decline  will have a significant impact on the number of newly qualified teachers  required in the coming year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly could bury its head in the sand &mdash; as some  Members appear to be doing &mdash; or it can deal with reality. We must deal with  reality: if we do not, the numbers of teachers trained will far exceed the jobs  available. There is no point in giving teachers a year&rsquo;s employment merely  because the Assembly passes a nice motion, only for the young teachers to  discover that there are no jobs for them after that year.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood:</strong> Will the Minister give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane:</strong> No, I will not. I want to keep going on my argument. The North of Ireland has not experienced  difficulties in teacher recruitment. In 2006-07, there were 776 intakes to the  initial teacher-training courses offered by the North&rsquo;s four main initial  teacher education providers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">All the courses that are on offer are heavily over&shy;subscribed,  with up to eight times more applications than places. That is an indication of  the strength of the education system, the  attractiveness of teaching as a career and the life choices that young  people wish to make.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We have to look at this issue in two ways. We must find alternative educational opportunities for  the teachers who are currently trained; there is much potential in them  and the system will benefit from having them. However,  we also must examine the career opportunities that are on offer and  whether it is correct to say that we do not have enough educational  psychologists and speech therapists, but are oversupplied with teachers. We  must get real. We must face demographic decline. Unless there is some amazing increase  in the birth rate; fewer teachers will be needed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I turn to the issue of demand. The number and type of  vacancies for which newly qualified teachers may be eligible to apply in any  one year is influenced by a wide range of  factors, but principally by the decisions of schools on the desired size of their teaching complements and on  the designation of teaching posts as full time or part time; permanent or  temporary.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Schools make those decisions in the context of their overall budgets and particularly in the light of  the funding that they receive under  the local management of schools (LMS) common funding formula  arrangements. I will continue to seek to maximise the resources that schools receive under those arrangements so that, on the  demand side, schools have the finances to employ their most valuable  resource.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The demand for teachers is also affected by the numbers who  leave the education service each year. Over  the last three years, about 2,300 teachers have left our schools due to  age retirement, efficient discharge, infirmity  and redundancy. The age profile of our existing workforce will also  influence the number of newly qualified teachers who are employed in future  years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Of the 19,796 teachers who are on permanent or temporary  contracts registered with the General Teaching Council (GTCNI), nearly 30% &mdash;  that is 5,878 &mdash; are 50 or over. The Department of Education has already  recognised the impact that demography is having and will have on the number of  teachers that we need. The level of intake to teacher-education courses is  determined annually by the Department, with the aim of maintaining a reasonable  balance between the numbers being trained and the projected number of teaching  vacancies. That determination is informed by a statistical teacher-demand model  that is sensitive to a number of supply-and-demand factors. The annual intake  numbers for the initial teacher-education institutions have been reduced by  almost 20%, from 800 to 699, in 2007-08.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As for the point that Alastair Ross raised, my Department  has issued guidance to employers, exhorting them to give preference to newly  qualified teachers and experienced non-retired teachers who are seeking  employment. Schools have also been advised that they should recruit to  vacancies on a permanent rather than a temporary basis, unless the vacancy is  clearly of a temporary nature.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Before 1999-2000, evidence suggested that schools were  appointing low-cost substitute teachers when the costs were met from the  schools&rsquo; budgets, but high-cost teachers when costs were met centrally. Since  then, the reimbursement of substitute teachers from all boards&rsquo; centrally held  funds has been restricted. That measure enabled more funds to be delegated to  schools while providing an incentive to schools to employ newly qualified  teachers for substitution purposes. However &mdash; and this is an important point &mdash;  schools have the flexibility to decide to engage a teacher at a higher cost.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The suggestion that teachers should effectively be banned  from seeking further employment after early retirement has been made on a  number of occasions, and while I understand the sentiment behind that point, the Department has resisted it on two grounds.  First, that has been resisted on the grounds of age discrimination. As a restriction of someone&rsquo;s right to seek employment,  such a measure would be open to legal challenge. Secondly, that has been  resisted because schools have to depend on the ability of substitute teachers  to meet urgent demands.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In some areas, a prematurely retired teacher may be the  only one who is available at short notice or with the experience that is  required.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>: The House is listening very attentively, but the Minister seems to be singularly avoiding  the core issue at the heart of the motion and the amendments &mdash; namely  whether the Department will introduce a scheme such as the Scottish model,  whereby those coming out of teacher training colleges have a year&rsquo;s guaranteed  employment? The Minister has not, in 12 or 13 minutes of her speech, yet  addressed that matter.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister said earlier that some teachers coming out of  college who have not found employment:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;may secure some  temporary part-time teaching.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText" style="text-indent:0cm;">Does  the Minister think that it is good enough that, after the years of primary, secondary and third-level  education that those students have spent preparing for a vocation, the  best guarantee that she can offer them is that:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;they may secure some  temporary part-time teaching&rdquo;?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane:</strong> If I were not being constantly interrupted, I  would have got to that point.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">First, people must be careful not to act like ostriches,  with their heads in the sand.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>:  No, I will not. I have one minute left, and &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  Will the Minister ever give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>: I  have already given way.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I would welcome the additional resources to support the  education service&rsquo;s many priorities. However, like all Ministers, I have a  budget within which I must operate and difficult decisions to make on spending  priorities. We play as a team. I request that the UUP and the SDLP join us in  playing as part of that team.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry:</strong> Will the Minister give way now?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane:</strong> No, I will not give way.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The potential costs &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  There is no point in &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>: I  am not giving way.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The potential cost of introducing a scheme that guarantees a one-year teaching post for all  students here who graduate with a teaching qualification, similar to the  scheme introduced in Scotland following the McCrone  Report, is substantial. It would cost &pound;12 million in the first year and  &pound;19 million in subsequent years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I look forward to receiving support when I bring our  comprehensive spending review proposals to the Executive table, and I very much look forward to support for my  proposals from UUP and SDLP Ministers. I am nearly out of time, so I welcome  the fact that the proposer &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker:</strong> The Minister will draw her remarks  to a close, please.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>: I  will, Mr Deputy Speaker. I also ask that people do not interrupt me. Not you,  Mr Deputy Speaker, obviously.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the fact that the proposer of the motion has  accepted the amendment standing in the names of Paul Butler and Michelle  O&rsquo;Neill. That amendment deals with the financial reality that all in the  Executive face. Mr Bradley&rsquo;s amendment does not.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>: Go raibh maith agat. Sinn F&eacute;in believes that the Assembly  should be doing all that it can to support  newly qualified teachers. We recognise the value that they bring to our  children&rsquo;s lives. As one Member has said,  Audit Scotland  analysed the McCrone <span style="letter-spacing:-.35pt; ">propos</span>als. It concluded that the teacher induction scheme  was one of the most successful elements of those proposals. That is widely  agreed across the board, but we must look  at what is best for us. We must examine all aspects of our education  system. How many of our graduates are achieving employment? What are our  pupil-teacher ratios? We need to examine our own needs.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That is not to say that we cannot learn from others.  Yesterday&rsquo;s visit by the First Minister of Scotland has led the way in working  with others and sharing experiences. However, it is clear that Basil McCrea and  Dominic Bradley were not paying attention in class yesterday when Alex Salmond  was addressing Members in the Senate.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  No, I will not.<span class="Italic"> [Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Alex Salmond addressed us in the Senate and suggested that  we learn from one another and work together. We should examine what others have  done and learn from good practice. The Assembly, as we now know it, is still in  its infancy. Our approach to the various pressing issues that come before the  House must be a realistic one. We are today expressing the wish of the Chamber,  and I am sure that the Minister will take on board the issues raised in this  debate in any decisions that she may make.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 2 adds to the motion and offers a more  realistic approach by asking the Executive to consider the issue in the context  of the comprehensive spending review.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm achoimri&uacute; a  dh&eacute;anamh ar na harg&oacute;int&iacute; a rinneadh ar son leas&uacute; uimhir a haon. I am please to  deliver the winding-up speech on amendment No 1.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">What a ridiculous situation the House finds itself in today. We have a report from a high-powered  Committee, an inquiry initiated by a devolved Minister &mdash; a represent&shy;ative of one of the parties in the House &mdash; yet we  debate a Scottish report. Have we lost our senses altogether? What is  the point of having devolution, and spending public  money to produce reports, and getting agreement from employers and trade unions on them, if we then run off to  take advice from Scotland?  That is ridiculous, and, as my colleague Mr Basil McCrea said, worse than  re-inventing the wheel.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Today was &ldquo;dump Marty day&rdquo;. Sinn F&eacute;in dumped their colleague, the former Minister of Education  Martin McGuinness &mdash; big time. Mr Butler disowned a report that was  initiated by his colleague Mr McGuinness. Later, Mr McGuinness was dumped by  Michelle O&rsquo;Neill, and, finally, came the worst cut of <strong>all</strong>: the current Minister of Education stabbed him in the back. Et  tu Caitr&iacute;ona?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The introduction of planning, preparation and assessment  time will create long-term employment for hundreds of young teachers. The  introduction of two days&rsquo; administration time for teaching principals in small  schools will alleviate their burden of stress and reinforce the creation of  employment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The lessons of best practice that have been learned from  England, Scotland, and Wales are encapsulated in the Curran Report, in the form  of a business case supported by a teachers&rsquo; union and employers&rsquo; representatives. The outworking of that report is  already with the Department of  Education; however, the Minister of Education did not refer to it &mdash;  perhaps she has not yet heard about it.  Should the Assembly tell those people that they are wrong, and that Sinn  F&eacute;in and the DUP want to take the scenic route?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Perhaps the DUP will take the high road and Sinn F&eacute;in the  low road, but where will it end up? It will end in a delay for newly qualified teachers&rsquo; being guaranteed a year  of full-time employment, and delay a measure that will add to their chances of  full-time employment well beyond that year. It will delay teachers&rsquo; in general  being given 10% extra planning, preparation and assessment time, and  principals&rsquo; in small schools being given two days&rsquo; administration time.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">All of those matters are interrelated. A guaranteed first  year of employment for newly qualified teachers is interdependent with  planning, preparation and assessment time, and with administrative time for  teaching principals. The initiatives support each other. Without planning,  preparation and assessment time, the newly qualified teacher&rsquo;s guarantee of a  year of employment will end abruptly. Administrative time for principals of  smaller schools will increase the chances of longer employment for newly  qualified teachers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">One problem with the DUP&rsquo;s motion was a failure of  mentoring. Miss McIlveen&rsquo;s guru Sammy Wilson has let down his prot&eacute;g&eacute;e; he  should have told her about the Curran Report, before she went wandering through  the heather in search of a wee dram. Sammy should have told Michelle the facts  of life. We have the answer in Northern    Ireland, and a business case is already with  the Department of Education.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I commend the first amendment. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I call on Mr Sammy Wilson to wind up the debate on the substantive  motion. I remind Members that we are winding up the debate and not the House.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  I will do my best to wind up both. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the debate. My two colleagues have brought an important issue to the attention of  the House and of the Minister, and have given it a public forum.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That issue is about those who invest heavily in their own  education &mdash; and there is a substantial investment in time, money and commitment  &mdash; and who find themselves subsequently unable to pursue their chosen career.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, I welcome the debate because for the first time I  have seen SDLP Members awake in the House. Dominic Bradley seemed positively  excited during the debate, which is the first time that I have noticed any SDLP  Member getting excited. The reason for his bluster was that he knew that his  arguments were weak. He therefore decided to set them aside and cover them with  a bit of bluster.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Bradley has taken the opportunity, in this House, to  perhaps mislead people who have not had a chance to read the Curran Report.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Here is the scandal of what Mr Bradley and the Ulster  Unionist Party, which apparently is going to support him today, are doing. This  motion is about the newly qualified teachers coming out of teacher training  college who do not have an opportunity to gain a years experience and complete  their probationary year. What is Dominic Bradley doing? I can understand why he  proposed his amendment &mdash; it is a prime example of the vested interests in  teaching that ignore the needs of young teachers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Curran Report does not just have the two  recommendations that Dominic Bradley quoted freely and often, and that Mr B McCrea  repeated: the majority of  the recommendations in the report deal with existing teachers; their pay structures, career structures, workload and  organisation. The SDLP is scandalously and shamelessly diverting attention away  from the issue of spending some resources on teachers who are just &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea:</strong> Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  The Member can shout and bully all he wants. I may give way, but not until I  have finished my point. Most of the recommendations in the Curran Report deal with people who are already in the  teaching profession. The motion &mdash; and I admit that it has limitations &mdash;  is about investing the limited resources that are available in measures that  may give students emerging from teacher-training college the opportunity to get  their probationary year out of the road and gain some long-term experience that  is more substantial than the short-term experience they would gain in a school  during that one-year period.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  I will give way in a minute. Will the Member just sit down and behave?<span class="Italic"> [Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Dominic Bradley is diverting attention towards other issues  that could absorb millions of pounds of the education  budget. Those who know what is in the Curran Report should realise the  implications of the amendment.  It takes away from the thrust of what Alastair Ross and Michelle McIlveen are  trying to promote in the House today. I will give way now.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Thank you Sammy. Only you are in the full flow of histrionics, and, apparently,  it is only you who are allowed to be so. The Ulster Unionist Party also cares  deeply about the issue. The reason we are supporting the SDLP is that we want  to introduce the measure now. It is something that has been agreed.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member please address his remarks through the Deputy  Speaker?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  My apologies. A hushed House will now hear a calm question. Does the Member  accept that everyone in the House wants to see action for newly qualified  teachers as quickly as possible, which does not require a huge debate and is  something that the Assembly should get on with?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  If the Curran Report is introduced into the equation, huge debate will be  necessary. If we are to address the matter we must do so in the context of  resources, whether the Ulster Unionist Party, the SDLP or anybody else likes  it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If amendment No 1 were to be made, it should be noted that the amended motion would be calling  for the Curran Report&rsquo;s recommendations to be implemented in full. As I  have pointed out, if that were to happen, the majority of resources that the  amended motion would be demanding from the  Minister would go not to newly qualified teachers but to the teaching  profession in general. That is OK for someone who lives in an unrealistic world  in which the infantile economics that some Ulster Unionist Members talked about operate: the &ldquo;Gimme, gimme, gimme&rdquo; stance.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><strong>Mr McCallister said</strong>:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;money should not be  the issue&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those words were fairly similar &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  He was quoting Sinn F&eacute;in.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker:</strong> Order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  A bit of barracking does not matter; it raises the temperature in here a  little.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker:</strong> I remind Members that this is the Northern Ireland Assembly, not some ancient  school.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson:</strong> It is like a bad third-form class on a  Friday afternoon, and the bad boys are in the corner to my right.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister:</strong> Snitch. <em>[Laughter.]</em></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson:</strong> We cannot divorce the matter from the fact  that resources are finite and that we must therefore target them. There is no  point in blaming Peter Robinson for the lack of resources. We get a block  grant, and we can raise extra money from the regional rate. Some Members have said  that we must spend the money on implementing the entire Curran Report, and I am  waiting to hear from them what they will make a lower priority and from where  they will get the money.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley:</strong> I remind the Member that I said that the  Curran Report&rsquo;s three elements &mdash; guaranteed teaching employment in the first  year after graduation, more planning, preparation and assessment time, and  administrative time set aside for principals who teach &mdash; are interrelated and  feed into one other. I understand that the  business case that has been given to the Minister proposes a strategic,  incremental pathway to the introduction of those measures. That pathway would  not eat up all the resources in the manner in which the Member thinks.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson:</strong> Whether the measures are introduced  incrementally or all at once makes little difference: resources will still be  diverted from the particular issue that was the thrust of the motion. Do not  forget that about 95% of the recommendations of that report have nothing to do  with newly qualified teachers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must live in a world in which resources are finite and  in which we must decide on priorities. I welcome the fact that, as recently as  this morning, Sinn F&eacute;in was willing to engage in reckless fiscal behaviour, yet  that attitude had changed by this afternoon. That is one reason why Mr Ross  accepted that party&rsquo;s amendment. Such a conversion should be welcomed, not  pilloried. Those Members should not be blamed or condemned for making that  change &mdash; it should be welcomed.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry:</strong> Will the hon Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson:</strong> Ah, why not?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry:</strong> I thank  the hon Member for giving way.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Earlier, the Minister said that the House was bound by the  Executive&rsquo;s making decisions as a team. In view of the hon Member&rsquo;s earlier  excellent speech on the Libraries Bill, in which he certainly won all five  stars that &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  Let me answer that quickly. I know the point that the Member &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>

	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  Does the Member accept that the freedom that he expressed this morning has been  lost by the Minister of Education? Are we to be subjected only to Executive  approval or &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Order, order. Will the Member resume his  seat?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Wilson, I will allow you a few seconds to finish.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  I appreciate that very much, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Let me just remind the Member that &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  Does he want to hear it again?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr S Wilson: No, I do not need to hear it again. The  Member might need to read things again, but I do not need to hear them again. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span><strong></strong>Let me just remind the Member  that the same constraints that the Minister of Education will serve under, and  which other Members will serve under, his Minister for Employment and Learning  &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>

	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker:</strong> Thank you, colleague and fellow Deputy Speaker, for that useful advice. I  thought that, in the circumstances,  Mr Wilson deserved an extra few seconds.</p>

	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Classroom Assistants&rsquo; Dispute</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30  minutes for this debate. The proposer of the  motion will have 10 minutes to  propose and 10 minutes to make a winding-up speech; all other Members  who wish to speak will have five minutes.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly calls on  the Minister of Education to take immediate action to settle the issue of job  evaluation for classroom assistants, by giving approval to the Education and  Library Boards to put an equitable offer to the representative Trades&rsquo; Unions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. T&aacute;  an-&aacute;thas orm an r&uacute;n seo a mholadh. I am pleased to move the motion. I declare  an interest in the classroom assistants&rsquo; dispute. I have been a teacher for  over 20 years and I know at first hand the work that classroom assistants do in support of pupils in mainstream  education and in support of pupils with special needs. Classroom assistants are an essential and integral part of  the educ&shy;ation workforce. Their professionalism and dedication are  highly respected and valued by all those who work with them, and by the parents of the children with whom they  work. The pupils themselves, when they are old enough, tell me that they  appreciate the tremendous work that classroom assistants did on their behalf.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Classroom assistants facilitate access to school and to the  curriculum for thousands of pupils. They support and encourage them. They  provide a front-line service and work directly with pupils every school day.  Investment in classroom assistants is investment in front-line services.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A letter that I received recently from a primary-school  principal illustrates the important role that classroom assistants play in the  education system. That letter states that the successful implementation of the  revised curriculum will require additional assistants &mdash; personnel who are so  essential in today&rsquo;s primary schools as aids to the quality of learning and to  the inclusion of all children, without discrimination.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When morale in the profession is already so low, I wonder  from where those much-valued classroom assistants  will come to implement the revised curriculum. I also received a letter  from a classroom assistant. That assistant wrote that morale is low, and that  tension and stress levels are at breaking point. Sadly, industrial action may  loom on the horizon.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The way in which classroom assistants have been treated by  their employers is nothing short of being the biggest industrial relations  scandal in the history of Northern    Ireland. It is incredible that the dispute  has been ongoing for 12 years without resolution. Nevertheless, that dedicated  group of professionals has continued to  serve children without major disruption. It is shameful that its  legitimate demands have not been equitably  met. The dispute involves over 7,000 classroom assistants. Unions have  described the &pound;30 million that has been offered to solve it as a drop in the  ocean.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Almost all job advertisements for mainstream, primary 1  classroom assistants state that NVQ level 3 is an essential requirement for the  job. However, their employers &mdash; the education and library boards &mdash; insist that NVQ level 3 is not essential for classroom  assistants in their job evaluations. How can a qualification be deemed  essential for people to be employed to do the job, but be totally ignored when  it comes to the job evaluation? Employers demand that people have the  qualification. However, they choose to ignore it when it comes to the  evaluation. Why do they adopt that attitude? They do so simply because they  know that to take account of the qualification would have a positive effect on the job evaluation. That is a totally  hypocritical stance. If a qualification is necessary to do a job, and  people have that qualification, surely they should be given credit for it in  their job evaluation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The boards insist that the special needs allowance is incorporated into the job evaluation exercise and  should not be an extra payment. However, teachers who are in receipt of a special needs allowance are paid it  over and above their salaries. The  teachers&rsquo; special needs allowance is either &pound;1,818 or &pound;3,597 per annum  depending on the duties that are involved. Classroom assistants are the only group of school-based board employees who  work directly with pupils in the classroom setting. In respect of the  special needs allowance, it seems legitimate that the comparison be made with  teachers, and not with other staff who do not work in the classroom setting.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Historically, as part of their terms and conditions of  employment, classroom assistants&rsquo; full-time hours equated to 32&middot;5 hours each week. The boards now insist, on the basis of equality with clerical officers  and manual workers, that that should be increased to 36 hours each week  and that their hourly rate of pay be calculated accordingly. However, as their  title clearly indicates, classroom assistants are classroom-based staff. Once  again, the obvious comparable group is teachers, who work full-time hours of  32&middot;4 hours each week, which is almost equivalent to those of classroom  assistants.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Had employers settled the dispute between 1995 and 2002,  many of the current difficulties would not exist. Classrooms assistants are  being made to pay for their employers&rsquo; maladministration. All of this may  impact on their pensions, and that aspect of the dispute has not been taken  into account.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased that no  amendments have been proposed, and I  ask Members to support the motion and to support the classroom  assistants in their attempts to achieve the equitable settlement that is their  due, and for which they have waited 12 long years. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education (Mr S Wilson)</strong>: I echo Mr Bradley&rsquo;s words. Those people  who have waited for 12 years for a job re-evaluation, hoping that their work  would be recognised at the end of it, must  be gravely disappointed, especially when one considers the consequences of the completed evaluation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When the Minister took  over, she quickly announced that &pound;30 million would be made available to  settle the dispute and to complete the job  evaluation. Many people hoped that that would put to rest an issue that  has been festering for a long time. However, rather than putting the issue to  rest, it caused massive disappointment and has had severe consequences for  classroom assistants. Let us not forget that classroom assistants are not extremely well paid. Many of them fall into the  lower-paid bracket.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The problem seems to be the decision to move from the  previous arrangements, whereby the hourly rate of pay was based on a 32&middot;5-hour week, to a 36-hour week. As the hourly rate is worked out by dividing the  weekly rate by 36, that brings the hourly rate down. Many classroom  assistants do not work a full week anyway; they might only work for 10 or 12  hours. Therefore, the hourly rate is important to them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">What surprises many people is that, up until now, payment  was based on working a 32&middot;5-hour week. Secondly, even if a classroom assistant  wanted to work a 36-hour week, because he or she is tied to the school working  week, he or she could not do so. Even if a classroom assistant works for the  full week, he or she could only earn 90% of the annual salary as a result of the way in which the new rules have been  implemented.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I do not suppose that it will be helpful to go into the  technicalities, because the negotiations are detailed and complex. However, I  want to ask the Minister two questions. First, when the Department allocated  the &pound;30 million, did the Minister question officials and assure herself that it  would lead to a fair settlement, or was she aware of the consequences of the  settlement?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The consequences are  that most of the 6,000 classroom assistants  will not get any back pay for the 12 years that they have been waiting.  They will actually end up with a pay cut  when they come off the old pay scales in June. When they start again in  September, they could lose up to &pound;1&middot;50 an hour because the new scales divide  the week by 36 hours rather than by 32&middot;5 hours. Given that they cannot work a 36-hour week, there are implications  for their pensions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Did the Minister apprise herself of that? If so, did she  simply, for the sake of spin, decide to go down that route because &pound;30 million  looked good?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><em>4.30 pm</em></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that this  Minister is different from the previous Sinn F&eacute;in Minister of Education,  who had form on the issue. When he was out of office, he promised those  low-paid, term-time-only workers that he would support their pay claim &mdash; and  then denied it when he was eventually in office. I trust that there will not be  a repeat of that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If the right questions  were not asked, the Minister must go back and ask them again. If there  was a deliberate decision to spin the allocation of &pound;30 million in order to  look good, with the consequences being unimportant &mdash; that is scandalous.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Butler</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I acknowledge the great work that  7,000 classroom assistants have done over many years in the education system.  They have filled a vital role in that system, particularly in working with  children with learning difficulties and special needs in special and mainstream schools. The work that classroom  assistants do with those children ensures that they are not left behind  by the education system. Classroom assistants are an essential part of the  teaching staff in all schools, and Members should acknowledge that and pay  tribute to them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The dispute about job evaluations for classroom assistants  has been running for a long time &mdash;11 years, in fact. The Minister of Education,  Caitr&iacute;ona Ruane, responded as quickly as  she did after coming into office in order to settle the dispute. The  Minister approached a resolution to the dispute by recognising &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  The Member said that the Minister responded after coming into office.  Discussions that I have had with officers in the education and library boards reveal  that that &pound;30 million has been around for two years.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Butler</strong>: I  thank Dominic Bradley for that information. This is one of the first items on  Caitr&iacute;ona Ruane&rsquo;s agenda, and negotiations with the classroom assistants&rsquo;  unions are ongoing.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The issues of remuneration and the correct grading of jobs  are important. The Minister is operating within existing resources, and she has  made a credible offer to resolve the  dispute and has set aside &pound;30 million to cover the costs of that settlement. It is a complicated matter that involves many interests: classroom assistants,  their trade unions and the education  and library boards. Coherence should be brought to each element of the  ongoing negotiations, with the aim being to settle the dispute.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As has been said about many issues in the Chamber, each  Minister has a limited amount of money to spend. I understand that this issue  is frustrating for classroom assistants, and efforts have clearly run into some  difficulties. However, I am satisfied that, with good faith on all sides, a  fair and acceptable settlement for classroom assistants will emerge. Go raibh  maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>: I support the motion on this important issue. If a dispute  goes on for 12 years, there is a tendency to think that something will eventually  be done. Although I did not know the  details, when I heard earlier this year that &pound;30 million was to be put  aside, I thought, like Sammy Wilson, that that was the matter sorted out.  Therefore, it is disturbing to discover that a well-intentioned action has  caused more problems that it hoped to solve, which highlights a number of  serious issues raised by other Members.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">All the evidence that I have seen supports the fact that better training, early intervention and  people looking after young people  provide immense results for society, and  Members owe a huge debt of gratitude to those who help in that part of  the education system.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I note Mr Bradley&rsquo;s point that it is inconsistent to make a  NVQ 3 qualification an essential requirement for the post of classroom  assistant while at the same time failing to offer adequate remuneration for the  job. There is a flaw in the negotiation process; either possession of a NVQ 3 is adequately recompensed, or a lesser qualification is accepted, in which case a  different pay grading or structure is required.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The nought-to-seven  strategy was discussed yesterday during questions to the Minister of  Education &mdash; I mentioned the situation in Finland,  and Mr Bradley mentioned Moldova.  I have been struck by the level of professionalism, commitment and skill  demonstrated by those who look after young people in other parts of the world.  We could make a step change in the way in which we educate our young people in  the social and behavioural spheres as well  as in literacy and numeracy. We must get that right.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">No amendments to the motion have been tabled, so we will not have the type of discussion that we  had with the previous motion. However, I am pleased to note we do not  have to refer this matter to the Executive, nor does it depend on resources  becoming available. We must deal with this matter now. I support the motion,  because it is not for me to say what is equitable and what is not. Sammy Wilson  said that the issue is highly detailed and complicated. I urge Members to get  into the detail and try to sort the matter out.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In yesterday&rsquo;s discussion of the nought-to-seven strategy,  I agreed with the Minister of Education <strong>when  she said that</strong>:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;there is a big difference between the education that  children receive in pre-school centres and that which they receive in primary  schools. What happens &mdash; I saw this when my own child went from pre-school into  primary school &mdash; is that there is a shock to the system&rdquo;. &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official Report, Vol 22,  No 12, p 495, col 2].</span></span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText" style="text-indent:0cm;">Many  children &mdash; of all ages &mdash; need help in coping with that shock to the  system, and the classroom assistants take the load of that shock. Without them,  the whole situation would be immeasurably worse.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must increase the effectiveness of the resources in the  education system, and I urge the Minister of Education, when she considers the  nought-to-seven strategy, to resolve the dispute equitably and as soon as  possible.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this debate. However, I am  extremely disappointed that the motion has had to be tabled in the Assembly,  considering that the matter in hand was first raised in 1994.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The evaluation of the work of classroom assistants was  agreed several years ago, and it is a disgrace that those most valuable members of the learning profession have not  yet received fair and proper remuneration. The important role played by  classroom assistants in the education of  children should have been recognised by the employers a long time ago, and proper remuneration should  have been paid to those staff who have given so much service over the years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have stood on picket  lines with classroom assistants and marched with them to the headquarters  of the education and library boards to appeal to employers to come clean and  pay those workers the wages that they  deserve. There can be no more delays or excuses: payment must be made now.  As a parent of someone with learning difficulties I recognise the dedication of  classroom assistants and the work that they have done over the years. It is a  shame and a disgrace that this dispute has been allowed to fester for the past  12 years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Similar evaluations have been carried out for caretakers,  drivers, secretaries and gardeners and other workers.  Classroom assistants in England  have had their work evaluated and are now being paid the appropriate  amount. The time for speeches, marches and pickets is over. It is now time for  the Minister of Education to authorise  payment to those dedicated workers. I support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  The Independent Regulators &ndash; OFSTED hae foun&rsquo; tha&rsquo; haein clessroom assistants  maks betther the quality o&rsquo; learnin fer weans in primary schuils an&rsquo; they ir  gyely valuable tae the education o&rsquo; weans wi&rsquo; special needs. Thair isnae onie  doot at they hae baecum an intricate pairt o&rsquo; the education system heir in the  Province gien extra attention tae thaim at ir needfu&rsquo; o&rsquo; a wee heft tae grasp  the notions, mebbe especially fer thae weans wha ir &lsquo;young&rsquo; in thair yeir bein  boarn in Mai ir Juin an wha ir fit tae thrive wi&rsquo; a wee bit extra tim&rsquo; at the  teacher hasnae gat tae spare.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The independent regulator Ofsted has found that the  presence of classroom assistants to improve the quality of learning for pupils  in primary schools is invaluable to the education of special needs students.  Although the role of the assistant was originally intended to ease the workload  of overstretched teachers, they have undoubtedly become an integral part of the  education system in the Province, giving extra attention to those who need that little bit of extra help to grasp  the concepts and reach their full potential. They are vital to the  growth of our children, especially those who are a little young for the year having  been born in May or June, who would thrive with the little extra time that the  teacher cannot afford to spare. Those in special needs education are able to  achieve greater goals when aided by a classroom assistant than without one.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister of Education has made much of her pledge to  provide &pound;30 million for the sector, but as so often happens, strings are  attached. While the dispute rumbled on for 12 years, classroom assistants  proved themselves invaluable in controlling  classes and offsetting large class sizes. As more smaller schools face  closure and class sizes swell again, the added help that those workers bring is  essential. They are indispensable in helping with statemented students, and  their input to overall grades and class management is not to be sneezed at.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As the classroom assistants play such a major role they  deserve to have their pay agreed. No wage agreement can go ahead if the side  deals include a large number of classroom assistants facing wage reductions,  or, as my colleague Sammy Wilson points out, a loss of pay protection.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I call on the Minister of Education to sort out this issue  once and for all. Classroom assistants truly deserve the wage increase without  the strings. They have waited long enough. I have been contacted by numerous  constituents who fight for fairness for their children by fighting for their  classroom assistants, whom they regard as having a very positive influence upon  the schooling of their children. I have also been contacted by teachers, and by  assistants themselves, who are caught in the confusion. Amidst all the talking  they do not know where they stand.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The issue affects 7,000 jobs in the Province through the  classroom assistant placements, and further affects countless teachers, head  teachers and boards of governors, as well  as the parents and pupils themselves. It deserves the focus and  attention of people who are dedicated to sorting it out. If this were Shorts,  or any other employer, the issue would not have taken so long to resolve.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister and her Department need to take heed of the Assembly and the proposal before the House  today. She needs to listen to the classroom assistants and the people of  the Province, and to ensure that the dispute is sorted out properly and  satisfactorily for all involved.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>:  Would the Member agree that it is imperative that it is the Department of  Education that takes this forward? Simply to agree pay within current education  and library board budgets will lead to an overall reduction in the number of  classroom assistants but not actually benefit children in the classroom.  Increased budgets are required.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>: I thank the Member for her intervention, and I agree  wholeheartedly with what she has said.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">To give an example of the numbers, there are 1,362  classroom assistants in the South Eastern Education and Library Board area in  my own constituency. It would be remiss of me, in my duty as an elected  representative, not to mention them, fight their corner and put forward their  case at the highest level in the debate today.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The education board needs to push for a settlement, as my East Belfast colleague Mrs Long so rightly said.It is up  to the Minister of Education not only to pledge the money, as she has done, but  also to solidify the position. Our  teachers, who are currently over&shy;stretched, would not be able to cope  without the aid of classroom assistants. It would be to the detriment of the  child if we did not follow this through. A leading teachers&rsquo; union, the NA<span style="text-transform:uppercase; ">SUWT,</span> stated that teachers highly valued the support and appreciated the  benefit of having another adult in the classroom.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In these days of very stringent child protection the  presence of another adult also gives peace of mind. Loss of the classroom  assistants would be sorely felt by teachers, and would have an adverse impact  on the students.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I speak in favour of the motion,  which calls on the Minister of Education to  address the issues around the pay  dispute. I fully accept that the matter is complex, so I will comment  only on the broader context.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The issue has been drawn out for far too long, so there is  an urgent need to address the matter promptly, as morale among classroom  assistants is low and they feel undervalued  and demoralised. Classroom assistants are professional people who want  their work to be recognised, and we fully support them in that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to  clarify from the outset that there is no dispute about the contribution  that classroom assistants make. We all recognise the important role that they  play, especially in providing assistance to children with special educational  needs. Like the previous speaker, I have stood on the picket line with  classroom assistants in support of their role.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In her short term in office since devolution, the Minister  has tried to address the matter within the narrow confines of the budget. The  &pound;30 million that she made available was a genuine attempt to alleviate the  situation. I totally sympathise with the classroom assistants, but we need to  deal with the matter in the framework that we have before us. I am sure that  all Members are only too aware of the confines of her budget but, despite that,  the Minister has committed to resolving the dispute. I fully support her on  that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that, through ongoing negotiation, the matter can be  resolved to the satisfaction of all and in a quick manner. Go raibh maith agat.  .</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Purvis:</strong> I thank my hon Friend Mr Dominic Bradley for  moving the motion. I had initially considered  proposing an amendment but none is required. Given the offer that her  Department has made, the Minister of Education has not settled the issue of job  evaluation for classroom assistants. The education and library boards have not  made an equitable offer to the trade union representatives.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">&ldquo;A Gender Equality Strategy for Northern Ireland&rdquo; states that the  Executive aims:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;to ensure the  economic security of both men and women&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">and</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;to achieve equal  value for paid work done by women and men, and promote their equitable  participation in the paid and unpaid labour force&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Economic independence is a vital element in ending  the discrimination and disadvantage that women face. I believe that the way in which classroom assistants have been  treated since 1995 goes against the grain of our gender equality strategy. In  my opinion, the treatment of classroom assistants could amount to indirect  discrimination, on the grounds that all those affected are women.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Does the Member agree that, if the majority of the classroom assistant  workforce were male, the dispute would probably have been settled years and  years ago?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Purvis</strong>: I  thank the Member for his intervention. The issue would surely have been settled  in months in 1995 rather than 12 years later, in 2007.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">This whole sorry episode has involved the down&shy;grading,  devaluing and demoralising of classroom assistants. Although colleagues have  referred to 7,000 classroom assistants, the number of women affected is  actually somewhere in the region of 10,000 because, in addition to the 7,000  current employees, some 3,000 members of  staff have left over the past 12 years. Some have actually died waiting  for their arrears to be paid. That is an absolute disgrace.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Classroom assistants provide a valuable service and they  were previously treated on a par with teachers. In some cases &mdash; and I refer  Members to a document on leave of absence,  issued by the South Eastern Education and Library Board &mdash; that parity  continues, as the policy treats classroom assistants and teachers as one and  the same. As my colleague said earlier, classroom assistants are classroom  based, but the insulting offer from the Department of Education downgrades  their role from a professional grade to a clerical grade.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As Sammy Wilson mentioned, paying classroom assistants pro  rata for 36 hours will actually make them part-time employees. How will that  affect their superannuation and future pension arrangements? Classroom assistants work the same hours &mdash; 32&middot;5  hours per week &mdash; as teachers. There is no work available for them for 36  hours per week. The Department has simply engaged in a cost-saving exercise.  Calculating arrears based on the new hourly rate is just a money-saving exercise that, in effect, robs classroom  assistants of what they have been due for the past 12 years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will give Members an example of the potential arrears.  The arrears due to one classroom assistant who came to see me, if calculated on  the previous hourly rate, would be &pound;24,000 of back pay over 12 years. Under the  new hourly rate, the back pay would be in the region of &pound;3,000. The Department  is seeking to claw back money. Pay them what they are due.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Removing the  special-needs allowance cuts the wages of classroom assistants by up to  60p an hour. It also removes the specialism of dealing with children with varying needs, preventing those children from  accessing the education that they  are entitled and thereby enabling them  to reach their full potential. That is further evidence of the  devaluation of the work of classroom assistants.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The treatment of classroom assistants over the past 12  years had been scandalous. Offers have been made and retracted, there has been uncertainty and instability,  salaries have been changed from monthly pay to lunar pay, and for what value?  Some classroom assistants have had to borrow a week&rsquo;s wages from their lying  month just to get by. That shows how low-paid they are. Why? To save the  Department money.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Now there is this offer. One could be forgiven for thinking  that the Department&rsquo;s action over the past 12 years has been nothing but a  stalling tactic and a money-saving exercise, in the hope that classroom  assistants would get fed up and leave. Many have left &mdash; over 3,000 &mdash; but 7,000  remain. Those 7,000 classroom assistants need to be valued, to be fairly  treated, to have security of employment, and to have an equitable offer.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My colleague Mr Butler  said that the offer put forward by the Department was a &ldquo;credible  offer&rdquo;. That is Sinn F&eacute;in speak for &ldquo;protect our Minister at all costs&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Purvis</strong>: I  look forward to being proved wrong. I support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  It is a scandal that this dispute has been allowed to drag on for so long. It  is another indictment of the direct rule approach to education in Northern Ireland  over many years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members have just debated a motion on teacher induction and  employment. Reference has also been made to that long-running dispute, which  continues to bedevil progress in the further education sector. Those disputes  do nothing to support and encourage the very groups that this society is  relying on to deliver the often-quoted &ldquo;knowledge-based economy&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Since their introduction  into schools some years ago, classroom assistants have increased, both  as regards their numbers and their impact on quality learning situations in our  schools. The stability of classrooms is important at a time of flux and  uncertainty, with the rationalisation of the number of schools very definitely  on the agenda. That is why we can do without another added element of  uncertainty.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Between 1997 and today, the number of classroom assistants has multiplied steadily, and they now  represent a sizeable component of the  educational workforce. The primary-school sector has 8,063 full-time  equivalent teachers; the post-primary sector has 10,509; in special schools,  the figure is 789; while there are currently 7,144 classroom assistants. My  colleague mentioned those who have left the service over previous years for a  variety of reasons.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Classroom assistants are not negligible or marginal add-ons. They are clearly an intrinsic part of the  delivery of quality education to our children. Properly qualified and specifically tasked classroom assistants have  brought an added dimension to the  learning process. The stability of the classroom-assistant workforce  impacts directly on schoolchildren. Quite frankly, I am at a loss to understand how the boards and the Department have  got themselves into such a mess in this long-running saga.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On the face of it, the  &pound;30 million recently announced by the Minister as a final settlement  sounded both generous and conciliatory.  However, on closer inspection, it is obvious that it has impressed  neither the unions nor the classroom assistants. When divided between serving  and former classroom assistants &mdash; and considering that the offer seeks to  address some 11 to 12 years of dissatisfaction &mdash; the individual sums are not  nearly so impressive as at first glance.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  Does the Member accept that, as a result of the new formula, many classroom  assistants will face a pay cut? They could be financing their own pay deal in  future years.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson:</strong> I thank Mr Wilson for his intervention.  The issue was referred to earlier, and it is another one that must be dealt  with by the Minister.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Another puzzling aspect is the boards&rsquo; insistence, when  advertising classroom assistant posts, that NVQ level 3 is an essential criterion for the position. However,  when it comes to evaluating the job, the boards appear to insist that that is  not a consideration. The boards cannot have it both ways.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Removing the special  needs allowance from classroom assistants who are central in enabling  children with a variety of individual and special needs to reach their full  potential is also a concern.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is incumbent on the Minister and her Department to spell  out clearly to the House how what appeared, at first sight, to be a reasonable  settlement to the dispute has become the focus of so much anger and dismay  among classroom assistants and their union represent&shy;atives. The Minister must  also specify what impact removing the special needs allowance will have on the pay of some classroom assistants. Changes in the  methods of calculating hourly rates of pay, both future and  retrospective, are an obvious focus for the suspicions and the fury of  classroom assistants. Members must be clearly informed of the impact of the changes.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Newton</strong>: I  welcome the motion and add my support for it. It is valid and deserves the  support of the whole Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The issue is highly emotive. Every Member has been lobbied  by trade unions, individual trade-union members  or groups of classroom assistants from schools in their constituencies.  The Minister has called on the education and library boards to settle with the  trade unions. However, a settlement has not been achieved and the trade unions  have warned of the possibility of strike action. As has been said a number of  times, the issue has been ongoing for 12 years, during which time there have been protests by trade unions.  Reference has been made to the vital role that classroom assistants play in school life. They relieve teachers of  some duties and they allow pupils to receive more attention and further  assistance with their studies.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The issue is being dealt  with through a job evaluation process, which is a process that is agreed  with public-sector employees and their  trade unions. The evaluation process provides a means of ensuring that  pay grades are determined in a fair and consistent manner and ensures that jobs  of equal value receive equal pay. The solution  to the problem lies in the job evaluation exercise, which forms the last  part of a major programme of job evaluation for all board staff.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Education has given approval to the education and library boards to make a final  settle&shy;ment. The evaluation of  classroom assistant jobs extends to some 7,000 staff. I read that the  Department has made &pound;30 million available for the settlement; I do not know  whether that figure is correct. We must  have some clarity on that: we need to know how that figure has been arrived  at and how it will be spent.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Purvis</strong>:  Is the Member aware that the &pound;30 million announced recently by the Minister was  already announced, some time ago, by the direct rule Minister Maria Eagle as  being ring-fenced for classroom assistants?</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">5.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Newton</strong>: I thank the Member for that intervention.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Employees and employers have been unable to agree upon  terms for a settlement.The very principle of job evaluation means that  no classroom assistant should suffer any financial loss as a result of the  exercise. However, reference has already been made to the fact that there may  be losses and that those who have moved on from the scene may well emerge as  losers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As has already been  said, this issue has been ongoing for  12 years, and a settlement is long overdue. It is only reasonable that  classroom assistants receive a fair and equitable settlement, as their role is  of the utmost importance in the education and development of the children in  their care.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Supporting this motion  will be a step towards securing a fair and equitable settlement for  classroom assistants, and it will confirm that Members value classroom  assistants and their work.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Savage: I welcome the opportunity to speak in  today&rsquo;s debate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the  Department of Education&rsquo;s intentions, and I acknowledge its apparent  willingness to resolve this matter, which has gone on for far too long. A sum  of &pound;30 million is nothing more than a step in the right direction. This debacle  has lasted for 12 years, which is 12 years too long.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is abhorrent to think  that many classroom assistants in gainful employment are working with  kids and full-time teaching staff but are not receiving adequate reward and  remuneration for their work. The situation must be urgently addressed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">With every passing year, the number of classroom assistants grows and their role becomes more important.  In 1997, there were 2,181 part-time  classroom assistants and 705 full-time classroom assistants. By 2003,  those figures had risen dramatically to 5,133 part-time, and 1,178 full-time,  classroom assistants. We can safely assume that now, midway through 2007, those  figures have increased again. I conservatively estimate that there are now  around 6,500 part-time classroom assistants and 2,500 full-time classroom  assistants.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to highlight one important statistic. The Southern  Education and Library Board area, which covers my constituency of Upper Bann, has the highest number of classroom  assistants of any board area. Figures provided in January 2006 show that there  were 1,249 classroom assistants in the primary-school sector; 267 in the  secondary-school sector; and 132 in the special needs sector. That leads me to  conclude that most of those currently involved in this dispute over back pay  come from, or work in, my constituency. I want to know what the Minister  intends to do to sort out this problem, because, frankly, &pound;30 million for the  whole of Northern Ireland  is an insult. Classroom assistants put a lot of effort and hard work into what  they do. Sadly, they are taken for granted and do not receive an adequate  reward for their efforts.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am particularly interested in the Minister&rsquo;s view on some  of the issues that the Northern Ireland Public Service Alliance (NIPSA) raised.  NIPSA has, justifiably, raised concerns about the boards&rsquo; intentions as regards  changes to how the hourly rates of pay are calculated, both in future and  retrospectively. One can understand that the proposed new education authority  must review the calculation of the hourly rates of pay, but it is deeply  worrying that the boards wish to apply that retrospectively. It is unjust and  unfair. Classroom assistants should be paid properly for the work that they do,  and they should be paid the money that they are owed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The removal of the special needs allowance for classroom  assistants is a major bone of contention, and it only compounds the problem  with the hourly rates of pay.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The removal of the allowance is a kick in the teeth to the  thousands of patient and caring classroom assistants whose work enables  children with special needs or learning difficulties to learn at their own pace  and to reach their full potential.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Further concern has been raised about the boards&rsquo;  insistence that the national vocational qualification (NVQ) level 3 is not a  prerequisite for the position of classroom assistant, when their advertisements  for such positions specify the NVQ level 3 as an essential criterion. The  boards must decide exactly what the criteria are when advertising for classroom  assistants. The current situation is bringing the vocation of classroom  assistants into disrepute, and the boards must make a decision and stick with  it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I trust that the Minister will respond in detail to the  points that I have made, and I look forward to her response. I also put on  record my sincere thanks and appreciation to classroom assistants, who do  sterling work in serving young constituents across the area.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education (Ms Ruane)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. T&aacute; a r&oacute;l  mar chro&iacute;l&aacute;r &aacute;r n-iarrachta&iacute; leis an chuimsitheacht a choth&uacute; agus le ligean do  n&iacute;os m&oacute; p&aacute;ist&iacute; agus daoine &oacute;ga oideachas a  fh&aacute;il i scoileanna pr&iacute;omhshrutha i gcuideachta a gcomhph&aacute;irtithe.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the opportunity to engage in this debate and the  chance that it presents to set out the steps that the Department of Education  has taken to help secure settlement of a dispute that &mdash; Members are agreed &mdash;  has gone on for too long. I also want to echo the comments made by those  Members who have spoken and to put on record my appreciation of the work of the  over 7,000 classroom assistants who work in our schools &mdash; large and small &mdash;  across the North of Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have been fortunate enough to have many oppor&shy;tunities to  visit schools since 8 May, and I have seen at first hand the dedication and  commitment of many individuals. One of the first schools that I visited was a special school, where I saw highly professional  class&shy;room assistants providing learning support to some of society&rsquo;s  most vulnerable young people. In that school, I saw not only the  professionalism of the classroom assistants, but their caring and sensitivity  to the needs of the children that they were supporting.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In other schools I witnessed the excellent work of  classroom assistants whose role is to support children in mainstream settings.  Their role is core to the Department&rsquo;s efforts to promote inclusion and to  allow more children and young people to be educated in mainstream schools,  where appropriate, alongside their peers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">N&iacute; fol&aacute;ir do na boird agus na ceardchumainn teacht chun  r&eacute;itigh, laistigh d&aacute; gc&oacute;ras caidreamh tionscla&iacute;och, ar na h&aacute;bhair ch&uacute;raim eile  seo.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Classroom assistants do more than support children with  special educational needs. Under the Making a Good Start initiative, the  Department provides funding for a classroom assistant for every primary 1  class, and for primary 2 classes in areas where attainment is low and social  deprivation is high. In my visits to primary schools I have seen at first hand  the invaluable role that classroom assistants play as support to the class  teacher and as a hugely positive force in the lives of the children in those  classrooms.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is no doubt about the value of the role that classroom assistants play in the education of our  children and young people. So, if we  are in agreement about that valuable  role, why has it taken so long to reach agreement on a job evaluation  process designed to ensure a fair rate of pay for the important job that they  do?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Job evaluation is not a  means of giving staff automatic pay increases &mdash; no matter how highly  valued they are. It is an agreed process  between public-sector employers and the trade unions to ensure that job  grades are determined in a fair and consistent manner, and that jobs of equal  value receive equal pay. The boards have advised that the results of the  evaluations show that many of the classroom assistants are correctly graded and  that their pay compares favourably with that of their counterparts in England, Scotland  and Wales.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The job evaluations have been completed, and three generic  job descriptions covering the different roles  played by classroom assistants have been agreed: classroom assistant in &mdash;  so-called &mdash; mainstream schools; classroom assistant in special needs; and  classroom assistant in additional special needs. If an individual &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ruane</strong>:  No. I have a lot of issues to deal with. I did not get a chance to finish my  last speech, so I want to ensure that I say all that I want to in this debate  before I give way.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If a classroom assistant considers that the duties that he  or she performs fall into a higher grading, an appeal mechanism exists for that  person to have their grading reconsidered.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The &pound;30 million funding has already been provided to the  education and library boards in anticipation of a settlement of this  long-running story. Naomi Long suggested  that this money is not additional, but it is and will not in any way detract from other areas of the boards&rsquo; work.  At a time when education budgets are under pressure,  that investment represents a huge commitment to our classroom  assistants, but it cannot be right for a sum of such magnitude to sit in board  accounts year after year. The priority must be to reach a settlement that will  allow the money to be released into the pay packets of hard-working classroom  assistants.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to clarify a  couple of issues that were raised by Sammy Wilson and others. Money has  been allocated to education and library boards, and the bulk of the &pound;30 million  has been with the boards as employers for some time on the basis of their  calculations of the cost of implementing the agreed job evaluation scheme. The  boards remain of the view that &pound;30 million is more than adequate to meet the  costs of the agreed scheme. Lest there be any confusion, I, in conjunction with  the Department of Finance and Personnel, gave approval to the employers to make a formal offer to trade unions, which  reflected the negotiations to date.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion calls on me to give approval to the education  and library boards to put an equitable offer to the representative trade  unions. That I have already done. Following a lengthy process, one that I fully  agree has taken far too long, I was pleased to note that the employers and the  unions had reached a point in their negotiations where the employers were ready  to put a formal offer on the table.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members will appreciate  that, in line with Government accounting  rules, any offer required the prior approval of both the Department of  Education and the Department of Finance and Personnel. Following consideration  of the proposal received from the boards &mdash; who are the employers in this case, not the Department of Education &mdash; the two  Departments gave their approval to the proposed  deal. That was communicated to the employers on 31<sup> </sup>May 2007.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">What are the next steps? I hope that the recent progress  will enable the boards and the unions to press ahead to secure an early and  final settlement that will allow the funding to be released into the pay  packets of eligible classroom assistants as soon as possible. The boards have  tabled their final settlement offer to the unions and the unions are consulting  their members.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The trade unions raised concerns about salary protection  arrangements, which have been included in the proposed settlement to ensure  that no classroom assistant will suffer any financial loss as a result of the  evaluation of their post. Unions also voiced concerns about pro rata pay arrangements and the level of GNVQ  qualifications required for mainstream classroom assistant posts.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The priority must now be for the education and library  boards and the trade unions to reach agreement through their established  industrial relations machinery on these additional concerns.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the role that  the Labour Relations Agency played  recently in helping to deliver progress, and I call on all those  involved to work together to reach a final agreement with the further  assistance of the Labour Relations Agency, if necessary.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The role of the Department of Education was to ensure that  the proposed settlement was workable and affordable. That is the basis on which  the boards were given approval by the Department of Education and the  Department of Finance and Personnel to proceed to the final settlement. This  matter is urgent and I am engaged in meetings with all the boards and the trade  unions about it. However, it would not be appropriate for me to become directly  engaged in the established industrial relations machinery or to intervene while  negotiations between the two sides are at such an advanced stage.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">However, I will encourage both sides to reach an  early settlement, which will allow funding  to be released into the pay packets of classroom assistants at the  earliest possible date. That is what is needed here and now.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">5.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  After listening to the Minister of Education, I am angry. I am not at all  pleased.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Over the years, classroom assistants have been used. Their  case has been like a football, kicked between the education boards and the  Department of Education. Today, all Members agree that classroom assistants,  who do wonderful work, and do it well, deserve to be recognised.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I do not believe that they will be recognised. If the  Minister of Education has made an equitable offer, why are the unions and  classroom assistants so angry? Why are they considering industrial action? That  threat is coming from people who are dedicated to their jobs, and have been for  years. People on whom our children depend every day of the week, and on whom  teachers and principals depend for the help that is required to give our  children, and especially those with special needs, the best education and care  possible.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The work that classroom assistants do cannot be counted in  pounds. That work has not been recognised either  in the past or by the Chamber today. I feel ashamed that after 12 years,  this is the best that we can do for people who have given their all for all our  children.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  Does the Member agree that the Minister of Education needs to go the extra mile  and ensure that extra funding to resolve the dispute for once and for all &mdash; not  the &pound;30 million that has been spoken of for umpteen years &mdash;is made available?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  The Member must be reading my mind, as that is what I had intended to say. I  have a two-page speech, but I am so angry  that I feel that what I have written is totally inadequate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><strong>Classroom assistants  must get the recognition that they deserve. I agree with Mr Shannon</strong>: the  Minister of Education must go the extra mile, so that our children do not lose  out by being denied the people who look after them and help to educate them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We all say that we want the best education for our  children. The Minister of Education says that she wants to provide the best  education. My advice to the Minister is that if she goes the extra mile, she  will address that issue and provide the best education for our children.  Otherwise, the children who attend our schools will lose out.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">After 12 years, it is almost incredible that we are dealing  with an issue that the people who went before us disregarded and hoped would go  away. The issue has not gone away. It will not go away. Classroom assistants  deserve what they are asking for. They should be given what they are asking  for.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank all Members for their positive remarks in  supporting the motion brought by my colleague Mr Dominic Bradley. He was right  to bring the matter to the House. However &mdash; and I say this with anger &mdash; the  situation with classroom assistants should have been dealt with 12 years ago.<strong></strong></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic"><strong>Resolved</strong>:</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly calls on the Minister of Education to take  immediate action to settle the issue of job evaluation for classroom  assistants, by giving approval to the Education and Library Boards to put an  equitable offer to the representative Trades&rsquo; Unions.</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion"><strong><em><span style="font-size:10.5pt; ">Motion made</span></em></strong><em><span style="font-size:10.5pt; ">:</span></em></p>

	      <p class="H3SectionHeading">ADJOURNMENT</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Car Parking Problems at <br>
	        Daisy Hill Hospital,  Newry</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Kennedy</strong>:  I am grateful to those Members who intend to remain in the House. In the past,  I have been accused of having made moving speeches. I am not sure how many people I will move today. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span> However, Members do seem to be moving  out of the Chamber.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Nevertheless, the car parking problems at Daisy Hill Hospital represent an important issue  that should be debated in the Assembly. I am  pleased that my colleague and good  friend, the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  Michael McGimpsey has joined us in the Chamber. Hopefully, by the end of the  debate, he will be an even better friend.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Car parking problems at Daisy Hill Hospital is a long-standing issue. It  has been a concern of local residents, hospital workers, patients and  neighbouring businesses.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As a member of Newry and  Mourne District Council, an interest that I am happy to declare, I can  confirm that the council has continued to make representations to both the  former Newry and Mourne Health and Social Services Trust and the Department of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety on the issue. The council has sought  to co-operate with the trust and assist wherever possible. In practical terms,  the council has recently leased some land on which an emergency helicopter can  land.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The issue of car parking at Daisy Hill Hospital must be resolved as soon as  possible. Several key problems need to be  addressed. Residents face the ongoing problem of vehicles being parked  outside their properties for long periods.  Those vehicles are effectively abandoned. All-day parkers take up spaces  that impact on the light and private amenities of properties.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is also a lack of adequate road markings. Even where  they are still visible, road markings that have been there for a number of  years simply identify permanent parking bays that cause a nuisance to local  residents and inconvenience them. The issue is cross-cutting. It is not only a  matter for the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety but for  the Minister for Regional Development, who represents Newry and Armagh. I am sorry that he is not present.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A traffic study and a full review of the parking trends on the hospital road and in other nearby  areas are needed. When the Minister for Regional Development reads  Hansard, I hope that he will respond to that call, which I hope that other  local representatives will also endorse. A traffic study is necessary, and it must  be undertaken by the Minister for Regional Development in conjunction with the  Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Householders adjacent to Daisy Hill Hospital have been very patient and  long-suffering over many years. They have endured major inconvenience and, on  occasions, considerable abuse from hostile individuals. Those householders  deserve some consideration.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Hospital staff are equally inconvenienced and frustrated  due to the difficulties that they face when trying to park at their place of  work. They want to see action, too. Perhaps the most important people to be  considered are those who attend the hospital as patients or visitors.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Daisy Hill is a large regional acute hospital. We are very pleased with it, and we wish to maintain and  retain its services. That is  something that I am happy to put on record in the presence of the  Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, who I know supports  Daisy Hill&rsquo;s position as an acute regional hospital.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, this is a hospital that provides essential  services to many thousands of people in the south Down, south Armagh,  Newry and, indeed, north Louth areas. From a council and a local representation  point of view, Daisy   Hill Hospital  remains the jewel in our crown, providing health services in the region. The  many people who attend as patients or who visit patients share the frustration  of trying to achieve a parking spot in what can often be very emotional and  difficult circumstances; they are there to receive treatment themselves &mdash;  perhaps urgent treatment &mdash; or to give comfort to a relative.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Consequently, parking  takes place in a very haphazard manner,  and the one-way system and very poor signage at the hospital combine to exacerbate the problems. There needs  to be a creative solution and some imagination shown. Earlier today, the  Minister used very creative language when he talked about the Lone Ranger, and  so forth. Sadly, some of us are old enough to remember the Lone Ranger and  Silver and Tonto and Kemo Sabe &mdash; but I digress.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In an ideal situation,  we would demand a multi-storey car park. That would provide an early  solution, but clearly there are cost  implications and also the potential introduction of charging for people  using such a facility. That might not prove popular to those public  representatives who would have to put it forward.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I press the Minister to  at least initiate a proper study to review  the problems and bring forward a costed proposal to see if we can make  progress on this matter. In the meantime, I also appeal, in his absence, to the  Minister for Regional Development to carry out the necessary remedial measures  to improve the current situation. Short-term improvements in markings and  signage can and should be made, and the  local trust should co-operate with those improvements as far as it can.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, I express my thanks to everyone for their interest  and input into this issue, particularly the Minister for his attendance. I  particularly thank the residents, staff and visitors; I know that they will  certainly appreciate the input and the attention that the Assembly will want to  give this important subject.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I am sure that Danny is old enough to  remember the name of Tonto&rsquo;s horse, but we will not go into that at the moment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On a more serious note, this debate is welcome, and I  concur with everything that Mr Kennedy said about parking at Daisy Hill Hospital. It is certainly a sufficiently  serious issue to be raised in the Chamber. It is an immediate problem for the  hospital, but it is symptomatic of the larger traffic problems affecting the  Newry area. Part of it, to a large degree, is the parking issue. In Newry, the  vast majority of parking spaces are located on one side of the city, which unfortunately is not the side where the hospital  is located. That does not help matters.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A proposal presented to Newry and Mourne District Council by my colleague Turlough Murphy has  received the support of the council.  The idea is to open Daisy Hill Nursery,  which is adjacent to the hospital, as a temporary parking area. That,  however, is merely a temporary solution to  a much wider problem. A permanent solution, as Mr Kennedy said, must be  found.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">5.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Photographs are often published of officials considering  the traffic problems in Newry; however, nothing  ever seems to be done to address those problems. It is time that all the agencies got together to implement a  permanent solution that is fit for the city.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Daisy   Hill Hospital  is one of the biggest &mdash; if not the biggest &mdash; employers in the area. That  creates a problem, as once staff get their cars parked, little room is left for  the cars of visitors and those attending outpatient clinics.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Most people who have used the car park would agree that  abandoned cars are a problem. Furthermore,  there is no regular parking, and the car parks are not supervised: it would  be possible to go into the car park and disappear for three months.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Kennedy mentioned the helicopter pad at the hospital,  which took up a proportion of parking spaces. One of the playing fields is now  used as a landing area; in fact, a sea-rescue helicopter landed there last  week. It is easily accessible to the hospital, and ambulances can go down to  the field to collect casualties quickly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The hospital has a big catchment area, and Mr Kennedy mentioned north Louth. I have spoken to  people from that area who use the renal unit at Daisy Hill Hospital. A reciprocal agreement is in place that enables  people from that part of the South to use  those facilities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I would welcome any study that the Minister of Health,  Social Services and Public Safety might initiate to solve the problem. It has  existed since the new hospital was built at Daisy Hill, and nothing has been  done to solve it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I entirely agree with what has been said about the  residents, because in many cases the gateways of the people who live opposite  the hospital are blocked off. Furthermore, cars have been vandalised on  numerous occasions. I agree with Mr Kennedy and ask that a solution be found  quickly. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. T&aacute; an-&aacute;thas orm an deis seo a  bheith agam chun labhairt ar r&uacute;n a bhaineann le mo thoghcheantar f&eacute;in.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased to speak in a debate that concerns my  constituency, and I thank Mr Kennedy for bringing the issue before the House. I  also thank the Minister for his presence and for his recent confirmation on the  future of the trauma services at Daisy   Hill Hospital  &mdash; a very important issue to everyone in that area.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Kennedy is correct in saying that time and time again  the issue of car parking at Daisy Hill Hospital  has been raised by public representatives in the Newry and Armagh constituency and by  councillors in the Newry and Mourne area. I have had several meetings  with the chief executive of the former Newry  and Mourne Health and Social Services Trust about the situation. More  parking spaces were provided on the upper site, near to the old hospital  buildings. Unfortunately, that has not been enough to eliminate the problem.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Daisy   Hill Hospital  has a wide catchment area that seems to be growing. It serves areas from east  Down, to north Louth and to beyond Armagh  city. It includes, particularly in the winter months when winter flu and chest  infections are prevalent, an overflow from Craigavon Area Hospital. Many of those patients return to the hospital for outpatient  appointments, and this adds to the pressure on already inadequate parking  facilities. That results in outpatients and some visitors being forced to park  on the pavements adjacent to the hospital, as all other parking spaces are  often in use during outpatient clinics and visiting hours.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The enforcement of parking regulations has meant that  patients, some of whom are already suffering from stress due to illness, have  returned to their vehicles to find that they have received parking fines.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Obviously, parking on the pavement is highly undesirable and can cause difficulties for the  pedestrians who are forced to walk on the road, exposing them to the  risk of injury from passing traffic. Also, it is undesirable for people to walk  on a road that is also the route of emergency ambulances. Members know the  difficulties and the dangers &mdash; Mr Brady and Mr Kennedy have outlined some of  them. However, how do we solve the problem?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Brady has suggested one possible solution. Another  solution, which might be implemented quite quickly, would be to open the  hospital site&rsquo;s Camlough Road  gate and allow the Busy Bus service &mdash; if it were well advertised and offered a  frequent service &mdash; to circulate around the hospital complex. I am sure that that would go some way towards alleviating the  parking problem by reducing the need for people to travel to the  hospital by car. It may not solve the problem, but it would go some way towards addressing it. Nonetheless, due consideration should be given to that option  without further delay.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The road opposite the hospital&rsquo;s lower entrance, where people  park at present, could be improved and parking spaces could be marked out. Once  again, although that may add a few extra parking spaces, it would not provide a total solution to the problem  &mdash; and it would involve the  Department for Regional Develop&shy;ment, as has been mentioned earlier by  Mr Kennedy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The nature of the Daisy Hill Hospital site is such that, under present circumstances, the number of  options remaining is limited. I agree with Mr Kennedy that the multi-storey car park option may be necessary to  solving the parking problems and might be advanced as part of the plans  for the new Daisy   Hill Hospital.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Two years ago, I met with Dr Andrew McCormick and his  colleagues at the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety. They  led me to believe that plans for a new hospital in Newry were moving along;  that a business case had been received from the then Newry and Mourne Health  and Social Services Trust, and that the Department had considered it and  returned it to the trust for amendment. My understanding then was that the  resources were in the system for the new hospital. I would be interested to  hear the Minister clarify, for us all, the situation regarding the new Daisy Hill   Hospital.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Returning to the parking issue, measures to address parking  problems would be welcome in the short term. However, I am sure the Minister  will agree that those would only be a sticking-plaster solution. In the long  term, we need a fully integrated parking solution that, I suspect, would be part of a new hospital complex.  I look forward to hearing the  Minister&rsquo;s response to those issues. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a  LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I will say, at the outset, that I have only  seen repeats of &lsquo;The Lone Ranger&rsquo; &mdash; I am not even sure if it has been  put on DVD. I thank my colleague, the very  old Danny Kennedy, for bringing this important issue to the House, and  it is excellent that the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  is here to respond.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As has been said, Daisy Hill Hospital serves a large area  covering Mr Kennedy&rsquo;s constituency of Newry and Armagh, as well as a large part  of my own South Down constituency. Everyone from that area is proud of the  hospital, its record, its staff, and the services that it provides.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It has already been said that there are serious parking  problems at the hospital. There are issues, which Mr Bradley has mentioned,  regarding people who cannot find a parking space and who are forced to park on  the pavement &mdash; something that has a knock-on effect with the involvement of the  &ldquo;red coats&rdquo;, illegal parking and fines, and the problems those cause. As Mr  Kennedy pointed out, local residents have been exceptionally patient &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  Does the Member accept that Daisy   Hill Hospital  is not the only hospital that has parking problems?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A similar problem exists at the Erne Hospital  in Enniskillen. For a long time, the car-parking attendant was not contracted by the local health and social  services trust but by an outside body that was responsible for catering  and portering arrangements at the hospital. Does the Member accept that it is  inappropriate for a car-parking attendant to have to sit in a rodent-infested  hut outside the hospital?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I accept Mr Elliott&rsquo;s intervention; in true style, he did not shy away from  bringing the debate back to Fermanagh.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are many hospitals  where car parking is a huge issue. At  Daisy Hill Hospital,  the one-way system forces staff and patients almost to abandon their  vehicles. The site of the car park is also problematic; it is extremely steep  and is inadequate to meet the requirements of such a large, busy hospital. When patients are being dropped off or  collected, they may need two people to help them: one to drive them there  and another to accompany them into the hospital, and vice versa. That is  unacceptable, especially in winter weather. I join Mr Kennedy in calling on the  Minister to review the situation and to work with the Minister for Regional  Development, Conor Murphy, to find a way through the issue in order to help the  residents, patients and staff at Daisy   Hill Hospital.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: I recognise that  car parking at hospitals is a serious problem, not only for Daisy Hill but for  a number of hospitals, including the Erne   Hospital. The increasing  level of car ownership and the rise in the number of people who attend  hospitals mean that there is a greater demand for car-parking spaces, which  causes stress for many people. However, it is vital that staff such as doctors  and nurses have adequate access to their place of work because, without those people, hospitals cannot function.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is a lack of car-parking spaces, not least at Daisy Hill Hospital. Currently, 442 spaces are available at Daisy Hill, but that  creates a shortfall, even when the site is managed. It is estimated that 612  spaces are needed. The Daisy Hill site is so congested, restricted and bounded  by roads that it is virtually impossible to find a new area to develop as a car  park. Newry and Mourne District Council has  offered a piece of adjacent ground for possible inclusion in the complex  to allow for car parking. Unfortunately, the council has offered that only on a  temporary short-term lease, and the investment  costs of its development make it prohibitive, because the hospital does  not own the land and does not expect to do so.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department estimates that a multi-storey car park would  cost around &pound;10,000 for each car-parking space. The creation of the required  car-parking spaces at the hospital would cost between &pound;6 million and &pound;7  million. That does not count in the fact that, during construction, which could  take between nine months and one year, the car park at Daisy Hill would  virtually be taken away because the new car park would be built on the original  site.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore there are no easy solutions. Around 80 cars are  routinely parked on the street because it offers kerbside parking that is  convenient to the front door of the hospital, and there is no charge.  Unfortunately, that parking is in a residential area. Given the nature of the hospital, which is open 24/7, cars are always  parked there &mdash; day and night, seven days a week. Clearly, that is a  nuisance to residents. However, neither the Department  of Health, Social Services and Public Safety nor the Southern Health and  Social Care Trust can deal with that problem. It is the responsibility of the  Department for Regional Development and Roads Service. As Mr Kennedy has  mentioned, the MP and MLA for Newry and  Armagh, the constituency in which Daisy Hill Hospital is situated, is also the  Minister for Regional Development and is in charge of roads. I would have  thought that he is well placed to alleviate the problems of the residents of  that area.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">5.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although the hospital has explored certain solutions, I am  not satisfied that everything possible has been done and that no stone has been  left unturned. Wider consideration is therefore required. I have instructed my officials  to carry out a regional review of car parking in order to establish a  consistent policy across all Health Service trusts because there are different  schemes in different areas; in certain sites, such as the Royal Hospitals,  charging is routine. A consistent policy is needed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">At Daisy   Hill Hospital,  a review must be carried out of the members of staff who are entitled to free  car parking. Those include essential workers such as medical staff, doctors and  nurses. Consideration must be given to how to deal with other employees who are  essential to the running of the site; it might be possible to accommodate those  staff in adjacent sites. The Department is also considering a park-and-ride  facility and is in discussion with Translink about how that might be  introduced. However, there is also the possibility that examination of the  design of the car park will enable the Department to determine whether the  number of spaces can be increased.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As things stand, however, with people&rsquo;s requirement to  travel by car and their insistence on doing so, it is difficult to see how  everybody will be accommodated during busy times. There will, therefore, need  to be some form of rationing of car-parking spaces on the site. I have asked  for the review to examine closely the management of the site, the scope for  encouraging better use of car-parking space  on the site, the restriction of on-street parking in consultation with  DRD, and for the trusts to work with that Department to consider what can be  done to enhance car-parking restrictions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A residents-only car-parking scheme on Hospital Road is necessary; that is, if  Roads Service can be persuaded to introduce one. If Roads Service can be persuaded to introduce such a scheme there, the  question is whether it could be persuaded to introduce schemes in other  areas, such as south Belfast.  However, that is an old theme of mine.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In response to Mr Bradley&rsquo;s question, there are ongoing  discussions and plans with an outline business case to redevelop the site. The Department is considering that  business case, which proposes that the preferred option would be to rebuild and  refurbish the existing site, including the provision of a multi-storey car park  as part of that redevelopment. That will create an additional 212 spaces,  which, the Department believes, will solve the parking problem. It will also  contribute to the investment on the site that is required for the hospital to  meet the latest standards.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to the Erne Hospital,  Mr Elliott will know that, given that Enniskillen is getting a brand new  hospital, I visited it last Thursday.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That acute hospital represents a &pound;260 million investment  and will occupy a very large site close to the  town. There should not be any car-parking problems because the site is  so big. However, in the meantime, the Department can ask the trust to review  the parking arrangements at the Erne   Hospital.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  I thank the Minister for giving way, and for his update on the new hospital at  Daisy Hill. What will the level of investment be there?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  I was not warned of that specific question, so I am unable to tell the Member  how much it will be. It was part of the  discussions with the previous trust. It is now a matter for the Southern  Health and Social Care Trust, and that context must be considered. However, I will make enquiries and reply to the  Member.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have magically been handed a note, which tells me that it  is &pound;136 million. It is a substantial development at a very early stage &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Tonto brought it.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  Kemo Sabe passed it to me. It is absolutely amazing; if only our car-parking  technology were as good.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, I have asked the trust to report back to me as  quickly as possible, and as soon as I receive that information, I shall convey  it to Mr Kennedy, Mr McCallister, Mr Bradley and others.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Adjourned at 5.52 pm.</p>
