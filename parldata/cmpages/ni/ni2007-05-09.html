		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. You will be aware that shortly after the  events in the House yesterday, an announcement was made to the effect that 500  workers are to lose their jobs in the Water Service. Is it in order to ask that  the new Minister for Regional Development address the House at an early  opportunity to reassure Water Service workers that there will be no compulsory  redundancies?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I am sure that the Minister for Regional Development will have heard the  statement and will act accordingly.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burnside</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. As <span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; ">we move  to the motion on the appointment of Statutory</span> Committees, will Members  have any opportunity to <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt; ">debate what was  generally considered to be the weaknes</span>s of those Committees in  scrutinising and controlling executive decisions of Ministers in the previous  Executive? Given that weakness, there should be widespread support in the House for strengthening them.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Today&rsquo;s motions are business motions for which there is no opportunity for  debate. However, I am sure that the Business Committee will consider any motion  that the Member wishes to table in the Business Office.</p>

		    <p class="H5StageHeading">Membership of Standing Committees</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText"><em>Motion made:</em></p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That this Assembly  adopts the membership of the Standing Committees as detailed in NIA 2/06-07. &mdash; <span style="font-style:normal; ">[Mr P J Bradley.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: On  a point of order, Mr Speaker. Standing Order  48(4) requires that the principle of proportionality that applies to  Statutory Committees should also apply to Standing Committees. It is my belief,  and that of the United Community group, that the failure to include any Member  from my group on the Assembly and Executive  Review Committee means that the requirement set out in Standing Order  48(4) has not been met.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It also seems illogical that a Committee that is to review  the total operation of the Assembly does not contain a single Member from a  party outside the Executive. It appears that those who talked so much about  inclusivity in the past are less anxious about inclusivity now. I understand  that discussions are ongoing about the issue that I have raised; however, for  the reason that I have outlined, the United Community group will not be  supporting the motion.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, in respect of Standing Order 51, it appears  the ultimate contradiction that a party&rsquo;s nominating officer &mdash; even if he is  only that party&rsquo;s acting nominating officer &mdash; can nominate himself to be  Chairperson of the Public Accounts Committee. That Committee must be seen to be  independent. Such a proposal would not be allowed in Westminster,  the Oireachtas, Holyrood or Cardiff Bay. It is most damaging for the  Assembly&rsquo;s prospects that that nomination is going through. My group, through  its representation on the Business Committee, recognises fully what is  happening, but let no one say that our failure to divide the House implies that we accept the terms of the  motion.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I am grateful to the Member for his point of order. However, I am satisfied  that the Business Committee dealt with the matter properly.</p>
