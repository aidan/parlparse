      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The Assembly met at 12.00 noon (Mr Speaker in the  Chair).</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
      <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="1"></a>Speaker&rsquo;s Business</p>
      <p class="H4StageHeading">Public Petition: &nbsp;Whitehouse   Primary School</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Mr Mervyn Storey has sought leave to present a public petition in accordance  with Standing Order 22.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  wish to present to the Assembly a public petition in relation to the delay in  the rebuilding of Whitehouse Primary School and nursery unit in Newtownabbey,  which, as Members know, was destroyed by fire on 18 July 2009. I am sure that  the petitioners welcomed the Minister&rsquo;s announcement last Friday that it is now  her intention to give the project the go-ahead. That is extremely welcome news  for all concerned. However, having been asked to present the petition on behalf  of the Committee and in light of the circumstances, I felt that it was only  right and proper that the effort to collate some 6,000 petitions was reflected  through the presentation of the petition to the House today.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The principal of Whitehouse   Primary School presented  the petition, which contains more than 6,000 signatures, to me, as Chairperson of  the Committee for Education, on the afternoon of Wednesday 12 May. Some 200  parents, pupils and staff gathered at the front of Parliament Buildings. The  Committee had previously agreed that I should accept the petition and present  it to the Assembly on behalf of the Committee. The petition takes the form of a  letter to the Minister of Education seeking a date on which building work on a  new school for Whitehouse Primary will commence. I am happy to report to the  House that the Minister&rsquo;s press release of Friday stated that work should begin  in a few weeks. Therefore, Mr Speaker, I present the petition to you in  accordance with Standing Orders. I can confirm that, contrary to what has been  suggested, the colours of the box do not represent either the SDLP or Glentoran  Football Club. They are the proud colours of Whitehouse Primary School.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Mr Storey moved forward and laid the petition on the  Table.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I will forward the petition to the Minister of Education for information.</p>
      <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="2"></a>Executive Committee Business</p>
      <p class="H4StageHeading">Licensing and Registration of Clubs (Amendment) Bill:  First Stage</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development &nbsp;(Ms Ritchie)</strong>: I  beg to introduce the Licensing and Registration of Clubs (Amendment) Bill [NIA  19/09], which is a Bill to make provision in relation to liquor licensing and  registration of clubs.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Bill passed First Stage and ordered to be printed.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Bill will be put on the list of future business until a date for its Second  Stage is determined.</p>
      <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="3"></a>Construction Contracts (Amendment) Bill: Second Stage</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel &nbsp;(Mr S Wilson)</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That the Second Stage of the Construction Contracts  (Amendment) Bill [NIA 16/09] be agreed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I begin by apologising for my late attendance in the  Chamber on Monday 10 May, which necessitated the rescheduling of the Second Stage  of this Bill. I hope that Members appreciate that it was not my intention to be  discourteous to the Assembly in any way; rather, it was the fact that it took  me longer than I had anticipated to get down to the Chamber and that the  business of the House continued.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I assure the Member for East Antrim Mr Roy Beggs, who seems  to be fixated on my movements and words, that my late attendance had nothing to  do with double-jobbing. I notice that he is not in his place, which may be  because he is doing one of his three jobs as a farmer, a local councillor and  an Assembly Member. I assure him that I was not distracted by duties at Westminster. I was in  Parliament Buildings, and it simply took me longer than I had anticipated to  get to the Chamber. It had more to do with my lack of agility and the fact that  the Minister of the Environment did not take as long as I thought that he would  in his Second Stage debate. I apologise to the Assembly; I did not mean to be  discourteous in any way.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill proposes amendments to the Construction Contracts  (Northern Ireland)  Order 1997. That Order was intended primarily to allow the swift resolution of  disputes by way of adjudication and to improve payment practices, issues that  have long beset the construction industry. The 1997 Order derives from Part II  of the Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996 in England and Wales. Known as &ldquo;the Construction  Act&rdquo;, that legislation had its origins in Sir Michael Latham&rsquo;s 1994 seminal  report &lsquo;Constructing the Team&rsquo;, which set out recommendations to improve the  workings of the construction industry and to tackle its damaging adversarial  culture through the promotion of greater integration and collaborative  practice. In 2004, Sir Michael was asked to review the effectiveness of the  Act. He concluded that, although, in the main, it worked well, some  improvements would be helpful. A series of public consultations was carried out  in GB, and detailed discussions were held with various umbrella groups  representing all parts of the industry. The ultimate outcome of those  deliberations was a number of amendments to the Construction Act, set out in  Part 8 of the Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act, which  received Royal Assent in November 2009.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">While the amendments to the GB legislation were still being  developed, my predecessor Nigel Dodds launched a public consultation on  proposals to amend the Construction Contracts (Northern Ireland) Order 1997. That  exercise was carried out between 8 April and 3 July 2009. The Department of  Finance and Personnel&rsquo;s proposals, as set out in its consultation, closely  reflected the amendments being put forward for the Construction Act at Westminster. That  approach was adopted because the amendments being considered in GB reflected  the outcome of extensive consultation with the construction industry and its  clients over a number of years at national level. The amendments represented a  distillation of proposals aimed at improving the operation of the Construction  Act, while achieving a proper balance across the frequently conflicting  interests in the industry. The changes also embraced the twin benefits of  ensuring parity of legislation and securing a level playing field for the Northern Ireland  construction industry, objectives seen as important prerequisites to any  changes.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Although the response to the consultation was limited, DFP  proposals were generally welcomed by the Northern Ireland construction  industry. For example, what critical comment there was tended to reflect the  view from one sector that we were not proposing sufficient change, while  another sector expressed the view that matters between private contracting  parties should not be subject to statutory intervention. Those differing  viewpoints serve to underline the continuing need to promote balance between  the diverse commercial interests of the various sectors of the construction  industry.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The proposals in general attracted broad agreement, and  there was emphatic support for the principle of the maintenance of parity with  the ongoing amendments to the corresponding legislation in GB. For example,  even in the case of a respondent disagreeing with a specific point, the  response would be qualified by saying that, notwithstanding his point of view,  parity with GB would be more important.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In considering how to approach the weaknesses that were  identified in the current Order, three options were assessed. We could do  nothing and rely entirely on guidance to the industry; we could target  specified areas in which existing measures are seen not to be working  effectively; or we could carry out extensive regulatory intervention. The  measures that I propose in this amending Bill follow the approach taken in GB  in seeking, where possible, to consolidate the already good track record of  co-operation between the industry and government. I propose legislative  intervention only in cases in which there is no realistic alternative.  Essentially, these interventions will fine-tune the existing framework rather  than make a wholesale change.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I turn to the content of the Bill and will quickly run  through each of the clauses. Clause 1 removes the prohibition of the  application of the 1997 Order to contracts that are wholly in writing. The  courts have interpreted &ldquo;wholly in writing&rdquo; strictly and have determined that  even contracts that were initially in writing but were subsequently varied by  oral instruction fall outside the 1997 Order. That prohibition has led to  disputes over contracts being excluded from the 1997 Order which otherwise  would have benefited from being resolved through adjudication.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 2 deals with the application of construction  contracts. The 1997 Order currently defines &ldquo;construction contract&rdquo; and  &ldquo;construction operations&rdquo; and contains an all-or-nothing power that allows the  Department to disapply all of its provisions from certain types of contracts. I  propose to amend the 1997 Order to enable the Department to disapply any, but  not necessarily all, of the provisions. That approach will allow us to ensure  that many of the valuable features of the 1997 Order, as amended by the Bill,  can continue to apply; for instance, the right to stage payments, the right to  adjudication and the right to suspend performance in the event of non-payment.  It will also allow us to respond proportionally to future contractual  innovation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 3 relates to the adjudicator&rsquo;s power to make  corrections. I propose to require parties to a construction contract to provide  for an adjudicator to have the power to correct any obvious clerical or  arithmetical error in his or her decision &mdash; the so-called slip rule.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 4 concerns adjudication costs. The Local Democracy,  Economic Development and Construction Act 2009, on which our public  consultation was based, includes a provision that renders ineffective, with one  exception, any agreement between contracting parties about the allocation of  adjudication costs and expenses. That exception relates to instances where  agreement is made in writing after one party has given notice to the other of  its intention to refer a dispute to adjudication.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">During its passage through Parliament, the Local Democracy,  Economic Development and Construction Bill was amended to provide for a further  exception. That amendment means that it will also be permissible for parties to  contract, in writing, to allow the adjudicator to make his or her allocation of  costs and expenses. Although views on that measure were not canvassed during  the Department of Finance and Personnel&rsquo;s consultation, I propose to include  that amendment because it represents good practice, and, most importantly,  would maintain the goal of parity, which was already accepted by those who  responded.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 5 concerns the determination of payments due. I  propose measures to clarify the require&shy;ments for contracts to include adequate  mechanisms to determine what periodic payments become due under contract and  how obligations under those contracts should be dealt with. Clause 6 deals with  notices that relate to payment. To deal with the issues of ambiguity and  improve the transparency of the process, I propose detailed measures to address  matters concerning the various mechanisms that relate to the issue of payment  or withholding notices. The proposals make separate provision for instances in  which the contracting parties have agreed that the duty to issue notices may  lie with the payer, the payee or some third party. Accordingly, they also set  out regimes for dealing with failure to issue notices on time or to make due  payment.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 7 deals with the requirement to pay the notified  sum. In the interests of improving cash flow, I propose measures to make it a  statutory requirement to pay the sum that is specified in payment notices,  except in some circumstances; for example, insolvency. Clause 8 refers to the  suspension of performance for non-payment. I propose to amend the provisions  that relate to a contractor&rsquo;s remedies, including the right to suspend work  when due payments that have been properly notified have not been made.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill comprises a number of separate amendments that  relate to various measures in the Construction Contracts (Northern Ireland)  Order 1997. Principally, I propose to increase accessibility to the process of  adjudication under that Order. That will allow disputes to be resolved without  parties having to resort to more costly arbitration or litigation. The measures  that I propose are also intended to improve cash flow in the industry by  improving transparency of procedures and removing the ambiguity relating to the  issue of notices and payment mechanisms. Those measures are intended to resolve  shortcomings that have been observed in the working of the original GB  legislation, which was replicated here in the 1997 Order. The proposals relate  to important issues. If enacted, they will provide real and practical benefit  to the construction industry in Northern    Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and Personnel (Mr McNarry)</strong>: The  Committee Chairperson is unable to be here, so perhaps this is a first: my  apologising for a Shinner. However, I assure the House that I am not setting a  precedent. The Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and Personnel is absent  owing to another engagement.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Over the past two years, the Committee for Finance and  Personnel has engaged with the Department on its plans to amend the  Construction Contracts (Northern Ireland)  Order 1997 and the associated Scheme for Construction Contracts in Northern  Ireland Regulations (Northern    Ireland) 1999. I will probably mention some  matters that were raised by the Minister, but it is important that the feelings  of the Committee are relayed to the House.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">On 4 June 2008, the Committee received an initial briefing  from DFP officials on the Department&rsquo;s plans to consult on proposals that were  aimed at improving payment practices in the construction industry. Members  heard that the proposals related to three broad areas: the adjudication  process, the payment framework and the right to suspend performance. The aim of  the proposals was to encourage parties to a construction contract to resolve  disputes by adjudication, rather than by recourse to other options, such as  litigation, which is very costly in time and money. The proposals were also  intended to provide greater transparency and clarity on payments. Members heard  from the officials that, rather than wholesale reform, the proposals represent  measured reform of adjudication and payment practices in existing legislation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">At its meeting on 30 September 2009, the Committee was  apprised of the outcome of DFP&rsquo;s consultation. Members heard that the response  to the consultation was modest, with only seven replies having been received.  Given that similar amendments were going through Westminster at that time, departmental  officials considered that the low response rate possibly reflected a  supposition that the same amendments would subsequently be made here. In that  respect, the Department&rsquo;s officials were keen to stress that full consideration  would have been given to any alterations or changes that arose as a result of  the consultation that DFP undertook. That said, the officials confirmed that  respondents indicated support for maintaining parity with the position in the  rest of the United Kingdom  and that there was broad support for the proposals that were consulted on by  DFP.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">At its meeting on 21 April 2010, the Committee received a  pre-introductory briefing on the draft Bill. DFP officials confirmed that the  draft Bill&rsquo;s provisions differed only slightly from the proposals that were  consulted on to reflect minor amendments that had been made to the  corresponding GB legislation. Those changes related to the power to disapply  any or all of the provisions in the 1997 Order with respect to descriptions of  construction contracts as specified in the relevant Order and with respect to  pre-dispute agreements on the allocation of adjudication fees.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">During the evidence session, members asked whether removing  the requirement for fully written contracts would, in fact, make an  adjudicator&rsquo;s job more difficult, when the intention of the clause was to make  the role easier. The departmental officials advised that, although contracts  may be written initially, the majority of them evolve over the course of  construction work and, therefore, many changes are not agreed in writing.  Therefore, it was important to note that the removal of that requirement should  broaden the adjudicator&rsquo;s role and his or her ability to deal with all aspects  of a contract, whether written or verbal.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Committee members also questioned depart&shy;mental officials  further on the response to the consultation, raising a number of additional issues  during the session, including the rationale for amending the legislation,  adjudication fees and public procurement requirements. Overall, the Committee  was generally satisfied with the briefings and the clarification that has been  provided by the Department to date. During Committee Stage, members will engage  with DFP officials and other stakeholders on the details of the Bill. In the  meantime, I support the principles of the Bill and the motion, and I believe  that that is the general view of Committee members.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I speak in favour of the motion, and I echo Members&rsquo; support for the principles  of the Bill. I do so in particular because of the two main planks that the  Minister offered as the thrust of the Bill: improving the payment process by  attempting to inject clarity and transparency into the payment of moneys due in  construction contracts, enabling, where possible, better cash-flow management  and, secondly, the attempt to engender a less costly and time-consuming process  for resolving disputes.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We all know the importance of the construction sector to  the local economy, and that has been seen most acutely in the worst of times,  rather than in the best of times, because that sector has borne the brunt of  the economic downturn, whether in unemployment, loss of productivity or loss of  skill sets. We have seen the construction sector suffer a great deal over the  past 18 months to two years. Anything that the House can do, it should do. That  could include approving the spending plans, which have offered great assistance  to the construction sector, that the Minister and his colleagues brought  forward for capital investment. Indeed, in some cases, that assistance represented  the only work that people in the sector were able to get. We could also try to  improve the process, which is what we are doing with this Bill, knowing as we  do how important the sector is to our local economy.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I hear construction companies say regularly that, although  the loss of business, the loss of contracts and the lack of contracts coming  through the system is bad, poor cash flow is one of the biggest problems that  they face. Any business may lose trade or business, but cash flow coming  through will allow that business to be sustained, as that money will allow  overheads and costs to be paid and people to be kept in employment. If that  cash flow is not coming through, it will be difficult to pay those bills, and  it will make life difficult with the banks. The lack of cash flow is often the  excuse that banks put forward for increasing fees or withdrawing facilities.  Given that the sector depends very much on good cash-flow management, clause 5,  which relates to determination of payments due, and clause 7, which relates to  the requirement to pay a notified sum, are important. The clauses that are  trying to improve the cash flow management of construction contracts are also  important.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The House knows how expensive disputes over contracts can  be to the public sector in time and money. We have seen many high-profile cases  where disputes have cost the public sector in Northern Ireland a great deal of  money and have delayed important construction contracts for a long time. When  the Committee for Finance and Personnel examined the procurement process in Northern Ireland,  it spent a lot of time concentrating on disputes, and it found how costly they  can be to the public sector. Indeed, such disputes can also be costly to  construction businesses. We should support any approach to get a more amicable  solution to disputes over contracts, whether that be over the timeliness of  payments or of jobs not performed. Therefore, I welcome the inclusion of the  relevant clauses in the Bill.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, the maintenance of parity with the rest of the United Kingdom  is critical. As the Minister outlined, there was some dispute over some of the  clauses during the public consultation. However, one theme that was constant  throughout was that people in the sector wanted to see the maintenance of that  parity. I also welcome the fact that, as the Minister said, this Bill is only  for matters for which legislation is required; it is not a wholesale change of  the whole system for the sake of it. Indeed, if such legislation is required,  the Bill is the only option available to the Minister to improve the system of  construction contracts. With that in mind, I welcome the Bill and support its  Second Stage.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. The Minister and Mr McNarry, who spoke  on behalf of the Finance Committee, comprehensively and expertly set out the  Bill&rsquo;s intention. As a member of that Committee, I support Mr McNarry&rsquo;s  remarks.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in recognises that there are too many possible  scenarios of conflict or dispute to allow a total guarantee or reassurance to  be given. However, we were given sufficient grounds to believe that the Bill&rsquo;s  intention on transparency and expediting the process of dispute or conflict  resolution and its ability to minimise the resort to legal redress is in the  broad interests of the industry. Disputes affect not only the primary  contractors but often the suppliers and those who rely on being able to provide  services in the food chain and those who may have difficulty maintaining their  necessary cash-flow levels.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Therefore, very briefly &mdash; I hope this will be the  shortest speech that we will hear on the subject &mdash; this is a good Bill, which  deserves the support of the Assembly.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  also support the Bill in principle. The Minister and the Deputy Chairperson of  the Committee for Finance and Personnel have told the House that the purpose of  the Construction Contracts (Amendment) Bill is to amend the Construction  Contracts (Northern Ireland)  Order 1997. That Order was a replication of the Construction Act 1996, which  sought to deal with the issue of payment practices in the construction industry  in what was intended to be a final way; however, that has evidently not turned  out to be the case. It was felt that amending legislation was required in Britain, and  departmental officials here felt that the 1997 Order had the same weaknesses  and advised that it should also be amended.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">When officials gave evidence to the Committee on the Bill  on 21 April 2010 they stated that:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;At the heart of the initiatives&hellip;were the concepts of  partnering, collaboration and integrated teamworking&rdquo;.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">They also said that they had:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;tried to eliminate any scope for lengthy disputes or  poor payment practices, which have constantly bedevilled the industry.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">They went on to say that:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Construction Act had been expected to enforce  best practice to ensure a fair balance and commercial power throughout the  demand and supply chain.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Although the original legislation was intended to  do all those things, there is a perception that it has not and that it needs to  be amended to achieve the three principles of partnership, collaboration and  teamworking; to resolve disputes by adjudication rather than by going through  the courts; and to create a level playing field in any dispute, whether it is  resolved by adjudication or by the courts. It is not entirely clear what way  the dice are currently loaded, but there is some suggestion that the stakes are  not evenly balanced in dispute situations.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I was somewhat concerned that the evidence that officials  gave to the Committee and the answers that they gave to my specific questions  indicated that there was a limited response to the consultation on the Bill,  with only seven responses having been received. On the face of it, that would  seem to indicate that there was not a groundswell of opinion; however, there  may be more views beneath the surface, and I am also unsure whether there was a  level playing field on the consultation. The public sector is often the client  in those situations, and it has a very strong voice, having representative  bodies that can articulate its case very professionally, and there are  professional bodies in the construction industry that are equally capable of  presenting their views. However, the private sector is much less structured,  and even large firms may not have the capacity for or experience of engaging in  that type of consultation. There are many small firms in the supply and  construction sides of the industry that have not expressed their views. I have  some concerns about that, which were not fully answered by officials, and I did  not see enough evidence of a proactive attempt to consult key stakeholders,  particularly those that I mentioned.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There are eight clauses in the Bill, which, as the Minister  indicated, are quite technical in nature. Therefore, it is a perfect example of  a Bill that we should support in principle, while welcoming the fact that the  Committee will examine it in detail. Given the highly technical nature of the  Bill, I cannot say that I am looking forward to that task with immense  anticipation. However, it is one of the jobs of work that happen behind the  scenes in the Assembly, and it will be very important to the entire construction  industry. Considerable reference has been made to the need to maintain parity  in the UK,  and certain stakeholders have argued strongly for that. That point must be  taken seriously, but many construction firms that operate in Northern Ireland  also operate to a significant degree in the South. Therefore, I ask the  Minister whether the issue of parity with the South of Ireland has also been  considered. It would be unfortunate if, in trying to maintain convergence with Britain, we were to diverge further from the  equivalent legislation that applies in the Republic of Ireland.  If the Minister were to address that point, I would be grateful, and we can  also consider it in Committee. I give my broad support, in principle, to the  legislation at Second Stage.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  shall endeavour to make my contribution even shorter than that of Mitchel  McLaughlin. The Alliance Party supports the legislation, which is largely  technical. If the response to the consultation so far has been limited, that  may be rectified in Committee. The Committee for Finance and Personnel will  undertake that shortly and can tease out the detail. We should welcome and move  forward with the principle of the legislation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Given the particular economic challenges that face the  construction sector not only in Northern    Ireland but elsewhere, the legislation is  timely. Prompt payment is important for the cash flow of all businesses,  including those in the construction sector. I also recognise that cash flow is  particularly important in the type of business environment in which many small  firms and independent traders work.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Disputes about contracts cause delays, which have not only  financial but economic costs, including lost opportunities to move forward. I  suspect that the temptation for disputes to arise is even more acute in the  context of an economic downturn, because of the pressures that businesses face  in trying to survive in a difficult environment. I hope that the legislation  will help to protect Northern    Ireland from that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Without straying too far into the next motion, I shall  follow on from Declan O&rsquo;Loan&rsquo;s comments on parity. It is important to recognise  that the market in Northern Ireland  is not and should not be viewed as a segment on its own, cut off from what is  happening elsewhere in the UK  or, indeed, the island   of Ireland. It is  important, in the first instance, that we follow what is happening at a UK-wide  level but also that we recognise the all-island dimension. If there is  divergence, we should use the forums available to us in Northern Ireland  to create as much harmony as we can across these islands. Without harmony, we would  be at a competitive disadvantage, because our being out of step would create a  barrier to companies from elsewhere working here. That would make it difficult  to ensure that we receive best value not only in the private sector but in the  public sector. Therefore, we have a strong economic and financial interest in  ensuring that we improve the current regime as far as possible. Along with  other Members, I look forward to discussing the Bill in greater detail in  Committee.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I thank all Members who took part in the short  debate on what some described as a complex issue. It has been a rather historic  afternoon. Mr McNarry knows what I am going to say. I noted two points from his  speech. He apologised for the Sinn F&eacute;in Chairman of the Committee, which must  be a first. He started with one startling statement and concluded with an  equally startling one, when he said that he totally supported the motion. It is  a first for Mr McNarry to apologise for Sinn F&eacute;in and to support a DUP  Minister. Although it will make this place less exciting and, probably, my job  less enticing, I hope that he keeps taking the medicine that he took this  morning, so that we get that combination.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  That is my contribution to unionist unity. You have to play your part.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I suppose that that is right. It is his plank for  unionist unity. I thought that I would remark on that before I started.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McNarry and Mr O&rsquo;Loan raised the issue of the limited  response to the consultation. As Mr Farry pointed out, if there has been some  defect and if people have either not had, not taken or missed the opportunity  to respond to the proposals during the consultation, they will have an  opportunity to do so during the Committee&rsquo;s investigation. One of the good  things about devolution is that there is an opportunity for legislation to be  properly scrutinised, and people can come along and express their views to  those who will make the decision about the legislation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I must say in defence of the Department that, as well as  meeting all the other statutory requirements, it notified over 40 bodies that  will be dealing with the relevant issues that the legislation was being  proposed and gave them the opportunity to respond. We received only seven  responses. When similar legislation was being dealt with in GB, 71 responses  were submitted, and one of those was from a Northern Ireland-based body. Only  13 responses were submitted for Scotland.  Proportionally, therefore, we had about one tenth of the responses that were  received for GB as a whole, so one might argue that we had a proportionally  higher response rate than other parts.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr O&rsquo;Loan also said that very few responses were received  from SMEs, an area that will be affected by the legislation. I do not think  that any SMEs responded, but the Member will know that many smaller businesses  tend to look to their central organisations, which are better equipped and have  better expertise, to deal with consultation responses on their behalf. I  suspect that many of their views were incorporated in the collective responses  from the bigger bodies. There will be an opportunity to be heard during the Bill&rsquo;s  Committee Stage, and it will be interesting to see whether some of those who  did not make their voices known during the consultation will want to come to  the Committee and speak about it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We have tried to reflect those views in the legislation. As  I said in my opening speech, the central plank was, first, to maintain parity,  for which there was a demand; secondly, not to introduce an over-prescriptive  statutory requirement on firms; and, thirdly, to try to identify where issues  had arisen with the defects in the Construction Contracts (Northern Ireland)  Order 1997 and to address those, and we have tried to do that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">One other point to come through was the importance of the  Bill to the industry. Cash flow is important at this time. The parts of the  Bill that deal with notification of payments being issued, with the requirement  for those payments to be made and with allowing a wider range of people to  issue those notices and the requirements in contracts such as the requirement  that the default position will be adopted in respect of any contract for which  there is no notice will help businesses to ensure that they get paid on time  for work that they have specified. Of course, they will have to specify the  work and justify the claim that was made. Transparency and cash flow are  important.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, the adjudication process will help many small  firms that cannot afford the costs of litigation and of employing barristers  and experts to go to court. One Member mentioned the adjudication process and  fees. Anyone who is entering that process, if they have any sense, will ask the  adjudicator to lay down their daily fee and the length of time that the work is  likely to take. There will be a limit to the amount of time as well.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">12.45 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It has been a useful debate. There is general assent, but,  as some Members have said, that may be due to the technical nature of the Bill  and the fact that Members have not gone into all the potential issues. However,  knowing the Committee, I am sure that it will do that during the Committee  Stage.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank Members for taking part in the debate and for the  way that they have worked with the officials. I note that the Deputy Chairman  recognised that the engagement with officials to date has been useful. That is  the way that it should be, and I hope that that will continue throughout the  Committee Stage. I commend the Second Stage of the Bill to the House.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">That the Second Stage of the Construction Contracts  (Amendment) Bill [NIA 16/09] be agreed.</p>
      <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="4"></a>Forestry Bill: &nbsp;Further  Consideration Stage</p>

      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  As no amendments have been selected, there is no opportunity to discuss the  Forestry Bill today.

      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30 minutes for  the debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes in which to propose  and 10 minutes in which to make a winding-up speech. One amendment has been  selected and published on the Marshalled List. The proposer of the amendment  will have 10 minutes in which to propose and five minutes in which to make a  winding-up speech. All other Members who are called to speak will have five  minutes.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Butler</strong>: I  beg to move</p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly calls on the Executive to explore, through  the North/South Ministerial Council, ways to develop policies in conjunction  with the Irish Government which benefit both economies on the island, with  particular consideration being given to the potential benefits of the  harmonisation of VAT rates, taxation systems and corporation tax; and further  calls on the Executive to work with the Irish Government to develop an  all-island economic recovery and development plan, aligned with an investment strategy,  to help address the adverse impacts of the present economic climate.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">T&aacute; m&eacute; an-s&aacute;sta a bheith ag caint faoin r&uacute;n sa d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht  seo inniu, agus t&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go mbeidh an Tion&oacute;l ag tabhairt taca&iacute;ochta di. The  amendment to the motion is acceptable. I do not see anything wrong with it, and  it does not take away from the overall motion. Therefore, as far as our party  is concerned, we accept the amendment.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The case for an all-Ireland approach to economic  regeneration should, first of all, be non-party political. The case for closer  economic links has to centre on the benefits that that will bring to the people  we represent. The most compelling reason is that it makes economic sense to  work together on this small island to help to better everyone, including the  business community, those who are employed, those who are unemployed and have  lost their job in the recent economic downturn and those who are about to enter  the workforce.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">All the economies on these islands face difficult times.  The Twenty-six Counties has experienced huge job losses and cuts in public  expenditure. The British economy is about to experience deep cuts in the public  sector, as it attempts to deal with one of the worst recessions that it has  witnessed in modern times, while the North&rsquo;s economy, as the Assembly knows  only too well, has felt the worst effects of the recession in job losses and an  increase in unemployment.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The case for an all-Ireland approach to economic matters  has been made strongly by the Government, the business communities in both  jurisdictions and trade unions. Independent research and reports also  demonstrate the benefits of an all-Ireland approach to economic regeneration.  In 2007, for example, the then chairman of Ulster Bank, Sir George Quigley,  stated that the Assembly should promote an all-Ireland economy through a single  joined-up effective agency, with the IDA and Invest NI no longer competitors  but fully collaborative.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Economic Reform Group&rsquo;s research shows that there are  increased opportunities for cross-border economic development. It found that  one in six firms in the North of Ireland and one in twelve in the South engage  in cross-border co-operation. The Irish Government&rsquo;s &lsquo;National Development Plan  2007-13&rsquo; states that:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;All-island collaboration offers a unique and  relatively unexploited source of competitive advantage for both the North and  the South.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The &lsquo;Comprehensive Study on the All-Island  Economy&rsquo;, which was commissioned by the British and Irish Governments in 2006,  is one of the most extensive reports on the development of the country&rsquo;s  economy. The report examined the strategic context for North/South economic  co-operation and looked at the strategic rationale and economic basis for  all-Ireland collaboration. The Irish Business and Employers Confederation  (IBEC) and the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) have a joint business  initiative that aims to enhance co-operation and improve competitiveness for  businesses in both the North and the South.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) represents the  country&rsquo;s trade union movement and works with other organisations, such as  government and business agencies, to develop all-Ireland economic prosperity  for its members. There have also been concrete benefits from all-Ireland  economic co-operation, which include major investment by both Governments that  is projected to be in the region of &euro;100 billion or &pound;68 billion in a 10-year  period. The Irish Government have committed major investment to key strategic  cross-border routes, such as those between Dublin  and Belfast, between Derry and Letterkenny and  between Sligo and Enniskillen. They have  provided nearly &euro;8 million to assist the development of the City of Derry  Airport.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The North&rsquo;s economy has potential to improve if economic  activity and policies are developed on an all-Ireland basis. A considerable  market of six million people exists in this country to develop such policies.  Since the Good Friday Agreement, trade between the two parts of the island has  steadily increased. Thousands of businesses from all over the island trade with  each other daily. Hundreds of thousands of people live their life on both sides  of the border; they reside in one jurisdiction but shop, study or work on the  other.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Economic planning and development on the island has been  carried out in a back-to-back fashion for many decades. Due to lack of  joined-up development in areas such as road, rail, air and sea transport,  businesses have suffered reduced economic opportunity. Constant fluctuations in  VAT, corporation tax, excise duty and currency have created barriers to  economic development on both sides of the border. Further research and analysis  should be carried out into the benefits of having one currency &mdash; the euro &mdash; on  the island of Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There have been many positive developments as regards  all-Ireland co-operation. The all-Ireland energy market has provided for a  competitive, sustainable and reliable electricity and gas market. The recent  announcement by regulatory authorities on both sides of the border of a move towards  the harmonisation of electricity and gas prices on the island is a welcome  development. Alignment of the two markets will reduce supply costs, raise  customer service standards and attract new investors. InterTradeIreland, which  was set up under the Good Friday Agreement, has developed many North/South  business opportunities. Since 2003, more than 1,300 businesses from across the island of Ireland have benefited from its help in  creating jobs and generating trade.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The opportunities and benefits of all-Ireland economic  planning have never been more pressing, given the present economic climate  facing both economies. In particular, the North&rsquo;s economy will continue to be  underdeveloped because of its dependence on and domination by the British  economy. It has no fiscal independence or power to raise taxes, which means  that the North&rsquo;s regional economy is overdependent on the public sector to  create employment.The North has always been peripheral to strategic economic  planning by the British Exchequer, with decisions in London inevitably  reflecting the economic needs of the south-east of Britain. The recent Westminster election  underlined how far down the list of the British Government&rsquo;s priorities the  North is: it was not mentioned even once during the election campaign, and,  when David Cameron mentioned it, it was to say how many cuts he would make in  the North if he became Prime Minister.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">An issue on which there has been some convergence of  opinion recently among the political parties here is corporation tax. Although  positions may differ on the actual rate, there is clear consensus across the  political and economic spectrum that corporation tax needs to be harmonised  across the island. Developing the island&rsquo;s attractiveness to international  investment should be a key priority for the North/South Ministerial Council.  Working through the NSMC, we must place the focus on enhancing the island&rsquo;s  business environment and securing maximum collaboration in export promotion.  There must at least be enhanced collaboration between the IDA and Invest NI in  promoting the island for inward investment, but both bodies should eventually  be merged into a single inward investment agency for the island of Ireland.  More work should also be done through the NSMC to remove obstacles to mobility  between both jurisdictions. The recent development of a dedicated cross-border  mobility website to help people who want to move across the border to live,  work or study is to be welcomed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The need for a skilled all-Ireland workforce is a key resource  for a more prosperous all-Ireland economy. The NSMC needs to consider how we  can build on the all-island skills study report and improve the all-island  skills base so that it contributes to all-Ireland economic development.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Resolving outstanding political matters arising from the  Good Friday Agreement and the St Andrews Agreement has dominated politics in  the North for the past number of years.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I ask the Member to draw his remarks to a close.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Butler</strong>:  Now we have an opportunity to turn our focus and attention to developing  economic policies for the benefit of everyone. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  I beg to move the following amendment: Insert after &ldquo;corporation tax;&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;calls for the full implementation of the November 2001  cross-border &lsquo;Study of Obstacles to Mobility&rsquo; report commissioned by the  North/South Ministerial Council;&rsquo;.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is a privilege to move the amendment. I thank Mr Butler,  Ms McCann and Mr McLaughlin for tabling the motion. It is an excellent motion,  and I am trying to add a minor amendment to widen it and make it practical. The  motion recognises that, at any time, we should be trying to create as much  flexibility and mobility in our economy as possible. It recognises that  flexibility and mobility are particularly important at this time because of the  economic circumstances in which we find ourselves. The SDLP amendment focuses  not just on identifying the problem and discussing it but on doing something  practical about it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr McClarty] in the Chair)</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The amendment refers to a study that was carried out at the  request of the NSMC in 2001. The study set out to do a number of things. Its  terms of reference were:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;To identify the obstacles to the mobility of persons,  in either direction, between North and South on the island of Ireland,  including: persons living in one jurisdiction and working, or seeking to work,  in the other; persons who have lived and worked in one jurisdiction but who  either have moved, or wish to do so, to live and work in the other  jurisdiction; students whose original residence is in one jurisdiction but who  are studying, or wish to do so, in the other jurisdiction; and persons who have  lived in one jurisdiction and now live, or wish to do so, in the other  jurisdiction, without working for remuneration.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The study was also asked to assess the obstacles to  people&rsquo;s mobility in key areas, including direct and indirect taxation; vehicle  importation and registration; social security; pensions; health; education;  training; recognition of qualifications; employment law; housing; and childcare.  In other words, the study had a wide remit. It was also asked to consider and  recommend ways in which barriers might be eliminated in either the public or  private sectors as appropriate. After long deliberations, it reached a number  of conclusions that I wish to draw to Members&rsquo; attention.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">1.00 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The study accepted the fact that a wide range of obstacles  affected people&rsquo;s mobility across several sectors. I am acutely aware of that  through my work in the medical profession and, in some cases, through my  dealings with students. The recommendations dealt with those obstacles.  Individuals and companies also face obstacles to mobility. For example, a  combination of factors may adversely affect a decision to move. These are  gloomy days, but, not so long ago, we could have removed some of those  obstacles if we had taken a big slice of the financial services sector into  east Belfast.  The obstacles faced were found to affect lower income groups adversely and  disproportionately. The costs of those obstacles are borne by individuals and  companies across the spectrum. The problems that we face are not unique to Northern Ireland or the island of Ireland  as a whole. Countries across Europe face  similar frontier issues in respect of the economy and the restrictions that  affect the way in which people operate and do business. Finding solutions to  those obstacles requires various efforts from providing information to  legislating.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to provide more minor detail about some, not all, of  the recommendations. The study made 50 recommendations on information sharing;  taxation; pensions; social security benefits; health, which is a big issue for  me; childcare; housing; transport; education; training and employment; and  telecoms, which affects us all because of roaming charges. If my friend Mr Campbell visits somewhere  such as Magilligan in his constituency, he may suddenly be hit with high  roaming charges for using his mobile. We are all hit with such rates if we are  within 10 miles of the border; telephone companies rip us off. The study also  made recommendations about banking and insurance, and, my God, I am sorry that  we did not take up some of those recommendations a few years back before the  current crisis.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to provide some detail about the recommendation on  taxation. The study recommended that information be shared between the North  and the South and that a joined-up approach be taken to taxation so that people  are not taxed twice. Quite often, individuals who work in the North but live  across the border and vice versa pay tax in both jurisdictions on the money  that they earn. Vehicle registration taxation is very high in the South, yet  someone who lives in the South but works in the North must buy a car in the  South and register it there. I mentioned double taxation, and the study  recommended better tax reliefs. It also recommended that pensions be  co-ordinated to ensure that people who move either North or South fit in. The  study also recommended that social security benefits be integrated. The fact  that information is not free-flowing creates difficulties for many honest  people and opportunities for those who want to claim benefits fraudulently on  both sides of the border. This extends, I am told, not just to Northern  Ireland/Ireland but to those who wish to defraud the social security system by  travelling from various cities in the English midlands to Dublin and vice versa.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There are a range of issues that we need to come to terms  with. There is little political sensitivity involved, and, in many cases, it is  a question of good management.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is a very strong case &mdash; it is in the North&rsquo;s interest  &mdash; for allowing people access to healthcare on either side of the border. I want  Northern hospitals to accept Southern insurance, because, for example, where a  new hospital is being built in Enniskillen, Fermanagh, that could bolster the  hospital and make it more sustainable.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The cost of housing was a major problem and, although it  may have eased quite a bit, access to finance is, nevertheless, much more  difficult. There is a clear need for a cross-border loan scheme that takes into  account the fact that many people from Belfast  travel or move to Dublin  to work for a period of time and, equally, that people move in the other  direction. Due to an oversupply in housing, there may not be a lot going on at  the moment in the Dublin  and Southern building scene. However, at the time of the big boom in the  construction industry, Northern    Ireland builders needed better access to  Southern projects.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I draw attention to the need for an all-island transport  strategy. God knows, with the volcanic ash cloud that is hovering over us,  those of us who have to go to another place this week are not sure whether we  will get there. There must be significant improvement on roads that serve both  jurisdictions, such as the Omagh-Ballygawley road or the Omagh-Aughnacloy road,  which are very important. There has been some co-operation; however, it is  important that that is sustained. Cross-border air and rural bus services all  feed into the transport strategy.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I could talk at length about education and training, in  which there needs to be mutual respect for qualifications. I am particularly  concerned that, for some reason, the senior medical training boards in London have decided that doctors, consultants, physicians  and surgeons from Belfast, who, traditionally,  have taken their exams through the Royal College of Surgeons in Dublin, somehow or other  do not possess the necessary qualifications.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member should draw his remarks to a close.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  In many cases, in real terms, those qualifications are very good, if not better  than those that are needed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I could talk about banking and insurance. However, I have  made my point through all that I have listed. I am glad to propose the  amendment and to support the motion.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  The mover of the motion from Sinn F&eacute;in indicated at the outset that this issue  is not party political. I suppose, in some respects, he is correct but only in  respect of the party aspect. It may not be party political, but this issue is  most definitely political. It appears that the acumen that devised this  proposal is similar to that which we heard expressed by the deputy First  Minister on Friday, when, in the company of the First Minister, he attempted to  have a &ldquo;Well done, David&rdquo; moment. Fortunately, that backfired, as one hopes  that this motion will. We will oppose the motion and the amendment for  precisely those political reasons.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have no difficulty with neighbouring countries,  particularly those with no language barriers, co-operating to their mutual  benefit. It would be patently absurd to create artificial barriers to  beneficial proposals that could impact on the lives of people in either state.  However, that is not what the motion is about.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">People in Northern    Ireland were not enamoured of the idea of  going into an all-Ireland economy when the Celtic tiger was leaping and  bounding ahead, so why on earth would anyone think that we would be more minded  to go into one now? Last month, unemployment in the Republic hit 13&middot;4%, which  happens to be about double the unemployment rate in Northern Ireland. There are 432,000  people unemployed in the Irish Republic, and, according to many economic  commentators, were it not for outward migration to the United Kingdom, more  than half a million people would be unemployed. Despite that, the proposer of  the motion wants us to join a banal scenario, which would leave us in an even  worse situation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Often, when comments are made about proposals such as that  in the motion, criticism of those comments begins with the accusation that the  unionist who opposes the proposal is looking over his or her shoulder at the  TUV. Normally, that is what is said. That cannot be said today. It is also  normally said that the comments are being made because there is an election  coming. That cannot be said today. There is no electoral or TUV reason behind  the comments that I am about to make. Some of us make such comments before,  during and after elections, and we do not change. Some people need to wake up,  smell the coffee and move into the twenty-first century, because people in Northern Ireland  will not vote to move into some sort of all-island economy. In fact, there is  much talk about referenda. I would be delighted to hear about a referendum in  the Irish Republic that would ask whether the  public would favour an all-island economy if it were to cost everyone &pound;2,000 a  year, every year for the rest of their life. I would dearly love to see that  question in a referendum and to see the answer.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Last year, construction output in the Irish Republic  fell by 32%. Capital investment fell by 28%. Politically, the issue of an  all-Ireland economy is a dead end, and it is going nowhere economically. Northern Ireland and the Republic need to  co-operate, and we need to do so on a basis that benefits the people here  initially; if people in the Irish   Republic derive benefit  from it, so well and so good.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Like the previous Member who spoke, after reading the motion, I was struck by  the sentiments that drive the call for harmonised economic policies north and  south. The sentiments were exactly that &mdash; sentiments. They may be nationalist  or national sentiments, but they are sentiments that are driven by political  dogma rather than economic imperatives or even common sense.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There are many ways in which the economies of Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic  interface and interdepend. Over the past few days, the people who will sit on  the Northern Ireland Advisory Committee of NAMA have been named. We also heard  that up to 150 developers from Northern    Ireland will have &pound;4 billion worth of loans  that were taken out during the property boom, transferred to NAMA. NAMA was  established by the Irish Government to buy and manage debt held by Dublin-based  banks after house prices crashed. It was also revealed that a number of Northern Ireland  developers owe NAMA in the region of &pound;100 million each. Of course, the  economies of Northern Ireland  and the Irish Republic are, therefore, intertwined.  However, despite that, our economy in Northern   Ireland remains deeply wedded to the United Kingdom  economy.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">1.15 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Northern    Ireland manufacturing sales for 2008-09, the  last year available, totalled about &pound;16&middot;2 billion. Of that, some &pound;12&middot;5 billion  was overseas trade. Out of that overseas total, almost &pound;6 billion went outside  the UK, which means that our  annual manufacturing trade with the UK is worth some &pound;6&middot;6 billion. That  is well over 53% of the total manufacturing overseas trade and some 44% of  total manufacturing sales. Sales to the Irish Republic  account for 10&middot;4% of total manufacturing sales and 28&middot;6% of manufacturing  exports. In addition, exports to the Irish   Republic are falling year  on year and fell in value in 2008-09 by some 9%. There is no question,  therefore, about the identity of our major trading partner: it is the rest of  the United Kingdom  by a considerable margin, and the proposers of the motion would do well to take  note of that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Of course, that does not mean that corporation tax should  not be reduced. Of course it should, and my party proposed that, along with the  creation of an enterprise zone covering the whole of Northern Ireland, as a means of  achieving a rebalancing of our public and private sector work imbalance. The  aim, therefore, should be a reduction in corporation tax not a harmonisation.  If that is the result, well and good, but the motivation must be reduction not  harmonisation. The call for harmonisation is just another example of Sinn F&eacute;in trying  to claim credit for a reduction in corporation tax as if it were designed to  bring us into the orbit of an Irish economy. Heaven forbid that we should queue  up to join one of the problem economies of the European Union, which does not  even share our currency, although how long it may be allowed to remain in the  euro zone remains to be seen. We take no pleasure in that, but those are the  simple, economic facts.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, Sinn F&eacute;in need not try to present the issue as  one of harmonisation with the Irish   Republic. It is not. It  is only the creation of a level playing field with a competitor economy that  for years used its corporate tax policy to attract inward investment and to  mount what amounted to unfair competition with our efforts to attract inward  investment. We do not agree with or subscribe to Northern   Ireland being part of an all-Ireland recovery plan, not  because we do not respect the Irish Republic or wish it well but because we are  predominantly part of the UK  economy and our economic recovery is bound inextricably to that of the rest of  the United Kingdom.  Therefore, we will oppose the motion and the amendment.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  The Alliance Party welcomes the debate. It is with some regret however, that we  cannot support the motion, because it goes way too far in talking about fiscal  harmonisation on the island of Ireland, which would be at the expense of the current  fiscal harmonisation with the rest of the UK. It is an either/or choice. The  position is similar with regard to what Mr Butler said about potential monetary  harmonisation. The SDLP amendment is, in itself, fine, and identifies an area  in which there are barriers to be overcome. However, it does not alter the  fundamental thrust of the motion, which, as I said, goes way too far. We tabled  our own amendment, which preferred a more balanced approach, but, regrettably,  that was not taken up.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to disassemble the economic, financial and  monetary aspects of the motion and look at them separately. There are areas  where we should be doing more. However, there are also areas where there are  important limitations and restrictions. We should recognise those and, in some  cases, keep them in place for good, sound economic reasons, leaving aside the  political arguments that were made.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is scope for economic co-operation and mutual  development. A certain segmentation of markets exists on the island of Ireland,  and there is scope for much better integration. That would be to everyone&rsquo;s  benefit, not least to the consumers who would benefit from the integration of  prices. There is potential for the development of particular clusters, such as  the green economy and tourism. We can market ourselves on an all-island basis  in some respects.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We should invest further in the infrastructure of energy,  transport, communications and information technology. We should also consider  how best to harmonise the regulatory environment to provide a more competitive  situation for investment. Overall, much more can be done on the economic front.  Equally, however, we must be realistic about all-island competition. We offer  different investment products, and there will, inevitably, be competition for  the location of investment on the island   of Ireland. Naturally, we  will try to attract investment to Northern Ireland. To do that, we  need to take various measures, not least of which is the reduction in  corporation tax. However, even if we were to have an all-island approach to  investment, the notion that we would benefit from that is somewhat flawed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Even before the Celtic tiger got into difficulty, the Dublin Government were talking about encouraging financial  services companies to come up to Northern Ireland. Those  opportunities were at the tail end of the investment and could not easily be  accommodated in Dublin, but there were back  office ventures that could have gone to Belfast.  They were not at the top end of the investments but at the lower end. There is  and always will be competition. That said, I would not dismiss the Celtic tiger  too readily, despite its difficulties. I disagree with Danny Kennedy: there is  no prospect that the Republic   of Ireland will be forced  out of the euro. The Irish economy has strengths and will, no doubt, rebound in  the near future.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party is much more worried about what the motion  says about fiscal and monetary matters. I look forward to the UK joining the euro.  That will not happen during this Parliament, but, in the longer term, the UK should join.  Northern Ireland cannot join  the euro independently of the rest of the UK. The motion implies full-scale  tax harmonisation, but I am afraid that that is a financial fantasy. The stark  reality is that, leaving aside the politics, Northern   Ireland has to be part of a wider UK system. Our  tax base is simply far too small to support public services and economic  development. Some 40% of our expenditure is supported in that way. To become  much more financially sustainable, we must challenge and overcome that  situation, but it will not happen overnight.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We must also challenge UK regional policy. Simply  speaking, it is much easier for 60 million people across the UK to support  the current situation than it is for a nation of four million people to do so.  We support tax-varying powers for the Assembly but only in the context of a  divergence from the rest of UK  policy rather than the full fiscal autonomy for which others seem to be  arguing. Fiscal autonomy with the Republic is not a realistic option. From a  financial point of view, opportunities exist for the better provision of public  services and for greater co-operation in that regard. The border clearly  distorts how we provide our services.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member must bring his remarks to a close.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: We  can consider that matter in a constructive manner in the months and years to  come.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Browne</strong>:  I oppose the motion and the amendment because they reflect misguided  nationalist aspirations, rather than making economic common sense. Any Sinn  F&eacute;in or SDLP Members who have read the financial pages of the newspapers over  the past few weeks must realise that their adamant opposition to any spending  cuts is viewed as political nonsense in the Irish Republic.  Are they not aware that, in the Republic, the ratio of the annual Budget  deficit to GDP is the highest in the euro zone and that the European Commission  proposes to impose financial penalties on any state that fails to meet the 3%  deficit requirement? In those circumstances, were the Irish Government to  embark on the kind of all-Ireland economy recovery and development plan that the  motion proposes, that would inevitably involve a substantial increase in public  spending. The Republic could risk financial penalties or even expulsion from  the euro zone.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Although the parties opposite may be loath to accept it,  the Northern and Southern economies have drifted apart in recent years. The UK has retained the freedom to set its own  interest rate and exchange rate policies, while the Republic has surrendered  control of those policies to Brussels.  As a result, the UK  enjoys much greater flexibility in planning for economic recovery. To suggest  that the Executive should draw up common economic policies with the Irish  Government is totally inappropriate.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Members know that the harmonisation of tax rates and  systems is a long-term policy objective of the European Commission. However,  progress has been limited, and tax competition still exists among member  states. Indeed, the new Secretary of State for Northern   Ireland announced his intention to bring forward  proposals to promote the growth of private sector business in Northern Ireland.  If the proposed measures include increased investment incentives or a reduction  in the rate of corporation tax, they might promote healthy competition between  North and South in attracting investment. Such a tax competition would be more  beneficial to Northern    Ireland than any attempt to harmonise tax  rates.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Recovery from the worst financial crisis since the Great  Depression is still fragile, and this is not the time to embark on grandiose  economic plans that neither the Irish nor UK Governments can afford.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Adams</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I support the motion and the  amendment.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I listened intently to the Member for East   Derry. I always try to pick some sense out of his remarks, but, in  this case, I found it impossible to do so. His only rationale for opposing the  motion and the amendment is that they are political. That is why we are here:  to talk politics. He offered no notion of how the DUP would deal with  unemployment, high levels of deprivation, including poor health and inadequate  housing, or the unacceptably low quality of life and living standards for those  on the lowest rung of the social ladder.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Let us face facts: before there was a global crisis, before  the Tories and the Lib Dems got into power and before we had 30 or 40 years of  British direct rule, the economy here did not work. It was always a basket  case. Let us deal with the logic. We are on a land mass. We are not arguing for  a united Ireland.  Obviously, our party is for a united Ireland. We think that that is the  best solution, and, in time, perhaps the Member for East   Derry and others will come round to the logic of that position.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Adams</strong>:  No, Danny, thanks.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We are arguing for harmonisation. We are arguing for  common-sense relationships, which the three parties that have spoken against  the motion signed up to in the Good Friday Agreement, the St Andrews Agreement  and the Hillsborough agreement. We are trying to stitch together things that  are of benefit to ordinary citizens.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Two years ago, the Minister of Finance and Personnel, Nigel  Dodds, acknowledged that the Executive have only a limited set of levers under  their control to manage the economy. For me, the rationale is that we should  have more control. We should have more sets of levers.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There needs to be a two-pronged approach, with new ideas,  solutions and strategies. That approach involves dealing with the British  Government to get as much control over as many levers as possible to manage the  economy and working with the Irish Government through the Executive and the  North/South Ministerial Council. This is about getting down to business and  dismissing ideas not because they are political but because they are not  practical and will not work. It is about harmonising VAT rates, looking at  taxation systems, agreeing a single rate of corporation tax and eliminating all  barriers to workers&rsquo; mobility throughout the island. It is about not having two  competing agencies, Invest NI and the IDA, arguing and competing with each  other.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">It also means &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Adams</strong>: No  thanks.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It also means that the same assistance that is given to  foreign investors should be available to local businesses.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Irish Academy   of Engineering, in  partnership with InterTradeIreland, recently published a report called  &lsquo;Infrastructure for an island population of 8 million&rsquo;. That report, which the  DUP will ignore to its cost, deals with projections for the island for the next  10 years or so, and it maps out some of what it thinks will happen. One  projection is that there will be eight million people on the island, with four  million living along the Belfast/Dublin corridor. The report states that  appropriate infrastructure investment along that corridor will allow us to  compete with other major European zones. It also argues for major  infrastructure investment in growth city regions of Ireland,  including Belfast, Newry, Enniskillen and Derry. No Members on the Benches opposite objected when  the Irish Government came forward with investment for the big infrastructural  roads around the A4 and the A8.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Member to bring his remarks to a close.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Adams</strong>:  Thank you, a LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">1.30 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I will provide clarification for Mr Adams on his last point. I certainly did  object to Republic   of Ireland investment for  the A5 project, simply because I thought that the concept was wrong. It is  clear that Sinn F&eacute;in Members are trying to impose some sort of all-Ireland  economic state. The electorate in the South of Ireland rejected their  proposals, so they are trying to impose them up here.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I have just started, but I will give way.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  Does the Member accept that there is some benefit to be had by people who pay  taxes in Northern Ireland  and then buy and build holiday homes in Donegal?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I am sure that that is right, and I am happy to listen to the Member if he  wants to elaborate on that point.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have no difficulty with co-operation. Co-operation is  needed in many areas, but we must accept the reality that we are often in  competition with each other. I visited a factory in my constituency recently.  Its management team told me that they did not want an all-Ireland economic  situation. Indeed, I assume that some members of that team support the party on  the opposite Benches that moved the motion. The company can label some of its  products &ldquo;UK&rdquo;, and, as it  also has an office in Drogheda, it can label other products &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo;. That  gives the company the distinct advantage of marketing its products in places  where each of those labels clearly has a better marketable value. Around 70% of  that company&rsquo;s market is in the UK.  It wants a UK  label because products that are totally Irish would not have the same value.  However, it can market the other 30% in the Republic  of Ireland and other parts of Europe where the Irish label may be more attractive.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is a strong case for reducing corporation tax in Northern Ireland to bring it into line with that  in the Republic   of Ireland. Although it  would cost the Executive initially, such a move has the potential to transform  our local economy and to make the island much more competitive. However, for  two simple reasons the Ulster Unionist Party will not support the motion. In  the first instance, we cannot support the political motivations behind it, and  our second reason is based on the economic and fiscal reality that we face  today. This motion calls for the harmonisation of tax systems between the Republic of Ireland  and Northern Ireland.  How exactly would that work? The motion ignores the annual &pound;9 billion  difference between tax take and public spending in Northern Ireland. As a region,  until we successfully grow our private sector, we rely on being a part of the  strong United Kingdom  economy to maintain public services, and that means being a part of the United Kingdom&rsquo;s  tax system.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion also ignores the fact that the euro zone is in  complete turmoil. It disregards the multibillion euro payout for Greece and the  subsequent and even more expensive rescue package for the threatened single  currency. The Republic of Ireland makes up one of the four countries known as  the PIGS &mdash; Portugal, Ireland, Greece  and Spain  &mdash; which are the potential recipients of such a rescue package. There is growing  frustration and anger in Germany  and a belief that the German taxpayer and economy are holding together those  four countries and the future of the currency itself. However, the offshoot of  what has happened is that there is likely to be much greater centralisation of  tax and fiscal policies in Brussels.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The president of the European Central Bank has stated that  there will have to be profound changes to the oversight of fiscal policies in  the euro zone. The euro zone is in serious difficulties, and Sinn F&eacute;in and the  SDLP want us to harmonise our tax system with that of one of the weakest euro  zone countries.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member please draw his remarks to a close?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  In order to get Europe&rsquo;s deficit under  control, the Republic this year will cut the pay of public sector workers by up  to 8%.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: My apologies. Mr Elliott has an extra minute.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Republic will also make cuts of some &euro;760 million to  welfare, and child benefit will be cut by up to &euro;16 million per month. Such  actions have caused Mr Adams to suggest that the Irish Government have failed  the people.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Does the Member agree that it is strange to hear Sinn F&eacute;in MPs and MLAs arguing  that the Brits should pump more money into Northern   Ireland, and yet Sinn F&eacute;in wants us to harmonise with the  Republic of Ireland, which is cutting its Budget  wholesale?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  Because only a short time remains to me, I will cut to the chase. Perhaps the  one option for tax harmonisation is to bring the Republic into the sterling  zone. I have not heard that suggested by Members on the Benches opposite, but  it may be the logical conclusion.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  In this debate and in similar ones in recent months on the Budget Bill and on  European funding, it seems that we miss the wood for the trees. Let me explain  what I mean. Paul Butler rightly said that the need to join up economic  activity on the island   of Ireland has never been  more pressing. Life has changed, changed utterly, as a result of the global  recession. Alasdair McDonnell rightly said that we should be doing something practical  about it. As I see it, both motion and amendment try to merge those themes: a  pressing need and a need to do something about it. That is all that the motion  does.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Gregory Campbell rightly differentiated between the  political and the party political. The election is over now. Given the pain  that may be coming and in view of what NAMA said last week about the toxic  assets on its books in the northern part of the island of Ireland,  which total up to &euro;5 billion, we need to shake ourselves. We must step back  from the potential party politics around this issue and, as things have never  been more pressing and in view of what Alasdair McDonnell said about doing  something practical, consider whether there is the opportunity to do so. If we  do not make that judgement call positively, then, in the view of the SDLP and  of a vast range of other people well beyond party politics, we will regret it  at our leisure.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In previous debates in this Chamber, I referred to the fact  that the head of an economic agency in the North told the SDLP a number of  months ago that, in his view, there were only 10 years to get North/South  right. I have not said previously who that person was, and people may have a  view about him. However, at a recent conference I referred to that fact again,  and that person was in the audience and acknowledged afterwards that he had  said that to me. That person was David Gavaghan. He has left the SIB, but in  his view we had only 10 years to get the North/South economic relationship  right. Therefore, do not listen to Paul Butler, Alasdair McDonnell or anybody  else whose agenda may be party political; listen to the likes of David  Gavaghan, who told me that the island of Ireland &mdash; North and South &mdash; is in  danger of losing its economic position because of the economic growth of the  East, coupled with the fact that countries in South America, with a combined  population of one billion, are about to start competing in the global market in  the way that India, China and Korea have done in the past 10 or 20 years. That  will happen as the global market moves and accelerates in a way that we have  not seen, even in relation to the Chinese, the Indians and the Koreans.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">David Gavaghan went further by saying that, if we do not  get it right in the next 10 years, Dublin and Belfast will suffer more.  I hope that David Gavaghan forgives me for making those points. I do not wish  to drag him into a party political debate, but I want to make a point about  what people with an insight on such matters are saying. I could quote many other  people &mdash; the heads of banks, economic agencies and businesses &mdash; who share that  belief, and that is the argument that unionism and unionist Ministers must  begin to address.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Whatever about harmonising taxes and the other worthwhile  proposals in the amendment, Governments North and South have commissioned  research over the past 10 years that has produced a body of evidence that is a  starting point for doing what the SDLP believes should be done on a North/South  basis. Paul Butler referred to the all-Ireland skills study. Alasdair McDonnell  referred to a report into mobility that was commissioned 10 years ago. There is  also a health report containing 37 recommendations on how to join up  North/South health provision to improve front-line services, save money and  improve the welfare of our people in the North and South. Those are practical,  operational, real value proposals.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member draw his remarks to a close?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  That should be the starting point, not the end point. If we do not take that  opportunity now that the election is out of the way, Gregory Campbell, we will  not forgive ourselves.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment (Mr A Maginness)</strong>: I  thank the Deputy Chairperson of the Committee, Mr Butler, who proposed the  motion, which is timely and fits in with the work that the Committee has  embarked on to regenerate our economy. Addressing such issues is of great  value. I think that everyone is united on the need for corporation tax in Northern Ireland  to be reduced to a level that coincidentally if not deliberately matches that  in the Republic.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Does my friend want to intervene?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way. He is right in the first part of what he  said: there is unanimity across the Chamber about the need for and the  desirability of a reduction in corporation tax. However he is aware that that  involves two issues: first, to what new rate, and, secondly, what will we have  to pay before benefiting from that decision?</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">1.45 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment</strong>: I felt that there was consensus, certainly among  economists if not politicians, that lowering the rate of corporation tax was  desirable because we share one island, our economies are interlinked and  greater investment in both jurisdictions would be of net benefit to both  economies. Direct foreign investment would be particularly attracted by a  reduction in corporation tax.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If the word &ldquo;harmonisation&rdquo; were taken out of the motion,  perhaps there would be greater political unity on the issue. However, there is  consensus that the argument in favour of a reduction in corporation tax is  irresistible. Our public finances and the block grant would take a hit, but  that is not an insuperable political problem; we could address it sensibly over  the next number of years. Indeed, corporation tax does not have to be reduced  immediately; it can be done on a tapered basis. Nonetheless, it is a  fundamental development that is necessary for us to effect a step change in our  economy. That is driven by the fact that we have a neighbour whose economy has  been transformed largely by reducing corporation tax. There is an indisputable  argument in that regard that I invite unionist colleagues to embrace.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">My time is running out, so I will speak very briefly as an  SDLP Member. Vision, imagination and ambition are required to regenerate the  economy, North and South. Of course, the economy and economic policy are  political issues, but we should not overpoliticise them. They should not become  partisan issues because attempting greater co-operation will benefit both parts  of this island, If we were to rely on the United Kingdom market alone, we  would be failing ourselves. In the South, there is a market of more than four  million people on our doorstep that we cannot ignore.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In these difficult times, we must all work to regenerate  our economy and the Southern economy. That should be done within the context of  the European Union, which provides us with the mechanism for co-operation.  Research and development in Ireland  is at a low level when compared with our European colleagues. It is important  that we raise the level of R&amp;D, which can be done usefully in conjunction  with our Southern counterparts.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member should draw his remarks to a close.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment</strong>: That would be of great benefit to both parts of this  island. I make a plea to my unionist colleagues: let us put aside partisan  feelings and work on a sensible, concrete programme of regeneration, North and  South, within the context of the European Union.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McHugh</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I am grateful for the opportunity  to speak on this motion. There runs a fear through this Chamber every time a  motion is seemingly cross-border or mentions harmonisation. We should move away  from that and try to have a vision of the areas on which we can work together.  There is not the slightest need for half the difficulties that raise their heads  and then sometimes cancel out the whole thrust or possibilities of a motion.  Tom Elliott should understand that if you run a business or one island or,  indeed, one farm, it is common sense to operate it as one entity and not to  have it split into several bits, as we have this island for so long. If even  the bits on which we can agree could be brought together, that would be  progress.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In an interview in &lsquo;The Journal of Cross Border Studies in Ireland&rsquo;,  Taoiseach Brian Cowan stated:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;North-South cooperation is a manifestation of  normalising relationships in Ireland.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The Irish Government have never passed up an  opportunity to develop policies to further areas in which we might work  together, which is why the motion has massive potential. The key to developing  pragmatic, all-island policies is to ensure that planners do not plan as though  the world ends at their jurisdiction&rsquo;s border. Although I welcome the motion,  it needs to encompass much more. The main impediments to a unified approach to  attracting foreign direct investment to the whole island are the differences in  the regulatory systems, North and South. To enable commercial transactions to  take place seamlessly on a North/South basis, we need to bring about complete  harmonisation of the regulatory environment.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I also suggest that we expand co-operation into science and  technology, innovation and R&amp;D. In the South, more than &pound;4 billion is spent  in that area, but we do not spend nearly enough. Such investment would help our  third-level institutions and their students to play a greater role in that  area. The key to all of that is to pool resources North and South for the  benefit of all.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Members on the Benches opposite spoke about the recession  in which we find ourselves. Recently, the Conservative Party mentioned the fact  that Britain  is borrowing something like &pound;300,000 a minute just to pay the interest on what  it borrowed to keep things running for the past number of years. Therefore, the  economy is in quite a mess over there as well, and it is from there that we  expect to get our block grant. We have no say about how much pocket money we  get from the block grant. We either get it or we do not, and we spend what we  can on what we have to spend it on. That is all that we can do, which is why we  must be prepared to think outside the box and think further about our island without  feeling threatened. Trying to run the economy better is a threat to no one.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Although the South has macroeconomic difficulties, there is  a lot that we can learn from its approach to trade and industry over the past  20 years. Because of regulatory approaches, much was not done right, but maybe  that is a lesson that we can learn from so that our children do not find  themselves in the same position in the future.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Spending cuts will come, and we will not be able to do  anything about them. Nevertheless, on the subject of people having their say,  when our fishermen and farmers negotiate in Brussels, they would not say that it would be  better to be on the British end of things.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member should draw his remarks to a close.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McHugh</strong>:  People in the South can certainly show us what to do in that area. It makes  sense to co-operate.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  Mr Butler is in favour of the amendment, Dr McDonnell is in favour, Mr Campbell  is against, Mr Kennedy is against, Mr Farry is against, although with his usual  caveats &mdash; maybe he is on the fence &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  shall be voting for your amendment.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  You are for our amendment, but against the motion. My apologies, Mr Deputy  Speaker; I will speak through you. Mr Wallace Browne is against the amendment,  Mr Gerry Adams is for it, Mr Tom Elliott is against it, Mr Alex Attwood is for  it, Mr Alban Maginness is for it, Mr Gerry McHugh is for it, and I shall be  voting for it too.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is as well that the Galleries are empty, because,  despite the seriousness of the motion and the fact that it was well drafted, it  raises issues that may some day become contentious among Members about whether  we will benefit at a regional level.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I would welcome some clarification from the Sinn F&eacute;in  Member who winds on the motion as to whether its members are talking about  absolute fiscal discretion. For example, are they talking about income tax?  Despite that, we are not talking about doing any of these things; we are simply  talking about looking at how they could be done. I do not know a single  businessperson in this region or in these islands who is not interested in  looking at all the available options. It sends a poor signal from the Chamber  that we have not been able to raise the debate to a level at which we can  discuss the options on their merits. It runs against everything that vibrant  economies are built on. It runs against the success that both our great islands  have been built on.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">What set the Republic apart in the past decade was a  strategic vision to invest in certain areas of its economy. That vision  happened to have been fuelled by a property boom, and that boom has led to a  property crash. The bits of the economy that are still there and are vibrant  and stable and the bits of FDI that have not left are those that are built on  the strategic decision about a decade ago to invest in what was then known as  the knowledge-based economy and what we today call innovation. Ironically, that  is the same strategic decision that we are trying to take here in Northern Ireland.  We have seen the MATRIX report, and we have seen and considered the report from  the independent review of economic policy under Professor Richard Barnett. They  tell us clearly that, if we are to build a future on our great industrial  heritage and on our commitment to and success in light engineering &mdash; it is  pervasive, not just in cities but in rural communities &mdash; we must transform that  success into added-value jobs that are sustainable in the long term. We must  use that success to attract foreign direct investment. In other words, we have  to align what we are already good at with what we teach in universities, what  we want to research in them, the type of skills that we wish to promote in  further and higher education institutions and the incentives that we have available  to attract those jobs.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I do not think that any of us disagree that we lack the key  incentive of a lower headline rate of corporation tax. Indeed, that has been  widely reflected in the debate. It is sad for me and, I suspect, for those who  have bothered to listen in that, instead of having a debate about the bits of  this island that could work much better together and the elements of our  economies, North and South, that should be closely knit together and about the  fact that marketing ourselves abroad when it comes to foreign direct investment  as we do in tourism with an equally attractive and compelling fiscal  proposition makes common sense, we came in here and rattled off the proverbial  in the usual old way. We cannot begin to look at the size of the problems that  genuinely confront us as a region until we stop doing that and until we can all  see beyond the smallness of our own politics. Mr Attwood mentioned Mr David  Gavaghan, the retired chief executive of the Strategic Investment Board. We do  not have endless time to come to the very obvious conclusion that, if our  region is to survive and these islands are to be reborn, people have to have  good jobs.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Member to draw his remarks to a close.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  For those good jobs to exist and for that investment opportunity to arise, we  must all be able to debate the economy on its merits, not its politics.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Leas Cheann Comhairle. When I looked around the Chamber  at the start of the debate, I hoped to see sitting on the Back Benches some of  the Ministers for whom the propositions before us would have had some direct  relevance. They could have attended and perhaps contributed in that capacity.  In fact, the lead spokesperson for the DUP turned out to be Gregory Campbell. I  cannot say that I was surprised or particularly disappointed by his comments.  He acknowledged, indeed conceded, that the motion was not party political, but  it was most definitely political.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Then, of course, he proceeded to give us a party  political rant. I do not think that he read the text of the motion, and I  question whether some other Members who spoke, particularly those who opposed  the motion and the amendment, did either. We are talking about exploring  possibilities and potentials. We are so afraid of exploring what would be in  the interests of the people who elect us to here, and that includes potential  scenarios, even if one does not want to concede that they are any more than  that.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The proposer of the motion itemised a significant body of  work conducted by both Governments, trade and business associations, the trade  union movement and the North/South Ministerial Council, all of which addressed  the benefits of collaboration and the development of an all-island economy.  Members should not bury their head in the sand and say that it does not matter.  Sinn F&eacute;in will not consider the failure of this regional economy, which goes  back the best part of 90 years, because that is how long the subvention that is  talked about has been in existence. It has been in existence primarily because,  at that early stage, the then Stormont Government &mdash; the one-party unionist  Government &mdash; acknowledged that they could not balance the economy. They could  not balance the books.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Options are available other than continuing to rely on a  subvention for the foreseeable future. Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s position is that the best  benefit to us all would be a united island and a united Ireland  economy, and it will continue to argue that case. Even though Sinn F&eacute;in proposed  a motion more than two and a half years ago that argued for additional fiscal  powers for the Assembly, it is encouraged by the fact that most of the parties  are now discussing that option. I take some encouragement from that, despite  the rhetoric that we have heard today. People may judge the debate on the body  language demonstrated and, perhaps, on the more extreme rhetoric. However, we  should acknowledge the fact that most Members who spoke in opposition to the  motion talked about the merits of co-operation and acknowledged that there  could be mutual benefits.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Several Members referred to the existing bodies. They could  also have referred to NAMA and the appointment of representatives here to look  after the interests of our regional economy. There was legitimate concern over  a possible fire sale by NAMA and over the extent of the property portfolio that  NAMA now controls. The Irish Government are effectively the single largest  investor in the Northern economy. What did the DUP Minister do when the Oireachtas  ratified the NAMA legislation? He immediately went to Dublin to talk to his counterparts, which I  publicly welcomed in the Chamber. I could have argued on a partisan basis that  that was an example of all-Ireland co-operation. However, the Minister&rsquo;s  actions made common sense; it was in our mutual interests for him to go to Dublin. That is the  direction from which people should come to the discussion.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Molloy] in the Chair)</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A sensible and constructive amendment to the motion was  tabled. I welcome that approach, because the amendment added value to the  motion, as was its intention. Would it not be better if that sense were  reflected across the Chamber? We all have responsibilities, and no one here is  arguing that the economy in the Twenty-six Counties represents the exemplar  model; it clearly does not. Sinn F&eacute;in has made many criticisms of the economic  structure and the manner in which the Irish Government have applied economic  policy in years past. Sinn F&eacute;in is not in the business of critiquing British  Government economic policy &mdash; their economic policy is their business. We must  consider how we can achieve what is the agreed number one priority of  rebalancing and growing the economy here. We cannot do that without taking  account of the fact that we exist on an island and without the necessary fiscal  tools. I defy any Member to argue that we can achieve the objective of growing  the private sector of our economy without those necessary tools. If people  think that they can achieve that, they are welcome to try, but I would like to  hear their rationale and argument. That is why I found Stephen Farry&rsquo;s comment  that the motion went too far particularly interesting. That means that  exploring the potential is a step too far for the Alliance Party. Perhaps  Members from that party will reflect on those comments, because &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  Earlier, a Member spoke about the prospect of an all-island regulatory system.  Does the Member accept that the failure of the regulator in the Irish Republic  to deal with the recent Quinn Insurance dilemma in a practical and workable way  had a detrimental effect on the employees and businesses in the South of  Ireland and in Northern    Ireland?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  The Member has made a fair point, and he should perhaps apply that logic to his  earlier comments.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">When motions are tabled from this side of the House with  the aim of developing and enhancing the power of the Assembly to regulate its  affairs, they are often regarded as problematic. Today, we again heard Members  defending UK  economic policy and comparing it with the Irish Government&rsquo;s approach. That is  not what the debate is about, and that mistake is constantly made. We should be  talking about what we can do to develop our economy, taking account of the  social, economic and political realities around us.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">With direct reference to Mr Elliott&rsquo;s intervention, I quote  the joint Government study on all-Ireland co-operation:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;There are many important steps which can be taken.  For example, on regulatory issues, both Governments are continuing to work  together to address the differences in the regulatory environment in order to  develop a truly all island economy.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is a comment from the British and Irish  Governments. Members should read those reports, because they are the road map  that point to the direction that we should take.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The issue of whether there will be an all-island political  system is a different debate, for which Sinn F&eacute;in is ready at any time.  However, let us be sensible about how we can represent the economic interests  of this region. We cannot do it alone, by burying our heads in the sand or on  the basis of the powers that Westminster  gives us at present. We require additional powers and the opportunity to  co-operate and to explore all the potential of that co-operation. That is what  the motion and its helpful amendment argue for.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I do not expect Members to change their mind today or,  given the upcoming election, in the next year. However, I ask the unionist  parties and the quasi-unionist Alliance Party to consider whether this is a  sensible way forward for the Assembly. The current approach condemns us to  presiding over whatever size of an economic cake Westminster decides to give us. No matter how  many times the British Government come back to take a big chunk out of that  cake, we will try our best to divide it up among the Departments. However, we  will also continue to preside over Budget deficits, which mean that we cannot  deliver the full range of services to which the people whom we represent are  entitled. I urge the Assembly to support the motion as amended. Go raibh m&iacute;le  maith agat.</p>

      <p class="OralAnswers-H2DepartmentHeading">Finance and Personnel</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question 1 has been withdrawn.</p>
      <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Migration: Public Services</p>
      <p class="OralAnswers-Question">2. <strong>Ms Lo </strong>asked  the Minister of Finance and Personnel whether his Department intends to spend  the &pound;1 million, from the UK migration impacts fund, to address specifically  pressures on public services relating to the transitional impacts of legal  migration. (AQO 1228/10<a name="AQO1228/10" id="AQO1228/10"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel (Mr S Wilson)</strong>: The Communities Secretary, Hazel  Blears, and the Home Secretary, Jacqui Smith, announced details of the  migration impacts fund on 19 March 2009. As a consequence of that decision, the  Northern Ireland Executive received &pound;978,000 additional current funding for  2009-2010 through the Barnett formula. However, as the Member will know,  allocations received through the Barnett formula are unhypothecated; that is,  we make the decision as to how they are spent. Just because something comes  under a certain budget head at Westminster  does not mean that we put it under the same budget head here. The additional  funding that arose was considered by the Executive and by the Assembly in the  2009 June monitoring round.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: As  that money is specifically to ease pressures on public services in relation to  migrant workers, should it not be ring-fenced to particularly target areas such  as health, education, employment and learning and, to a degree, the voluntary  sector, which has carried out front-line services for migrant communities?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The Member raises an interesting point. However, if  we simply took it for granted that money allocated to us under the Barnett  formula was ring-fenced for the purpose decided at Westminster,  there would not need to be a devolved Assembly here in Northern Ireland.  We would simply take it that the money had been allocated to us for a certain  purpose, and we would use it for that purpose.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The whole point of having the Assembly is that we decide  what the spending priorities for Northern Ireland ought to be. Of  course, as this matter was considered in the June monitoring round, there were  opportunities for Departments and Ministers to bid for the money if they  believed that there were particular needs concerning the issues the Member  mentioned. Indeed, Committees &mdash; I am not sure which Committee the Member is on  &mdash; could have raised the matter when they were discussing the monitoring round  bids. All I can say is that no bids were made in the June 2009 monitoring round  for the type of issue that the Member has suggested, nor was there a demand for  that when the monitoring round was debated here in the Assembly.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Leonard</strong>:  Given what the Minister said about the workings of the Assembly and the reason  we are here, has he had any specific discussions with Executive colleagues  about creating an emergency fund for those who, due to immigration status,  cannot access public funding for services that they need?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: There is a mechanism in place already. Monitoring  rounds take place four times a year in the Assembly, when Departments declare  reduced requirements. Funding from those reduced requirements is put into a  central pot, and Ministers can bid for allocations from that central pot. That  is the mechanism should an emergency arise during the year. Of course, for  planned expenditure, it is up to Ministers, Departments and Committees to make  applications or raise issues before the final Budget for the year is set. As I  know to my expense &mdash; I spent long hours here during the Budget debates in  February and March, and I thought I was living in this place &mdash; there is ample  opportunity at that stage for Members to raise issues on the Floor of the House  if they feel that the Budget does not reflect those pressures.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  What specific approaches and bids has the Minister received from the Office of  the First Minister and deputy First Minister, which has responsibility for  dealing with actual crises that may have arisen in the past year or that could  arise in the future?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: In 2009-2010, when the migration fund was made  available to us, no bids were received from any Departments. I will point out  to the Member and the Assembly that, although the money was made available in  2009, to date there has been no indication that any money will be made  available this year. That comes back to the point made by another Member for  South Belfast Ms Lo. We could have ring-fenced the money from Westminster. However, that funding was a  one-off event; year-on-year funding for that purpose will not be provided.  Therefore, a programme might have been started that could not have been  continued.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>: I  thank the Minister for that information. Will he tell the House whether any  Northern Ireland Department has highlighted funding pressures in relation to  the migration fund?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: No Department has bid for money to deal with the  pressures that migrants might place on it. However, I understand the Member for  South Belfast&rsquo;s point. Very often, there is a  big influx of pupils at schools in certain areas where migrants congregate.  There was an influx of nurses who came to work at Whiteabbey Hospital  and their families to my constituency. One of the local primary schools then  found that a large number of the children spoke English as their second  language, and that created certain pressures. The Department of Education is  responsible for making provision for those children. In fact, the common  funding formula enables that to happen. However, if Departments consistently  identify such pressures, they have an opportunity, through the monitoring  rounds or the budgetary process, to make that known and to make bids. Of  course, Members of the Assembly also have an opportunity to do that. They can  raise the issue with the Minister, the Committee concerned or at debates in the  House to try to raise awareness and to persuade Departments to make bids where  such needs are identified.</p>
      <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Chancellor of the Exchequer</p>
      <p class="OralAnswers-Question">3. <strong>Mr  Easton </strong>asked the Minister of Finance and Personnel when he intends to meet  the new Chancellor of the Exchequer. (AQO 1229/10<a name="AQO1229/10" id="AQO1229/10"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The First Minister and deputy First Minister have spoken  to the First Lord of the Treasury by phone and are expecting him to visit Northern Ireland  very soon. After that, I will be seeking an early meeting with the rest of the  new Treasury ministerial team. I need to raise a number of important issues  with the incoming Treasury ministerial team, not least the approach to and the  timing of the next comprehensive spending review.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  Does the Minister plan to look at ways of simplifying financial issues and  creating better transparency of the Estimates and the Budget with the Treasury?  Does he agree that that would be in the interests of Northern Ireland?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The Treasury alignment project in England was the  result of concerns that MPs raised about the transparency of the Budget and the  ability to prove accountability. However, as the Member will know, the way in  which we conduct our budgetary process and present our accounts are matters for  the Assembly. Therefore, I will not be raising them with Treasury officials or  Ministers. However, the Member raises an important point. During debates in the  House on the Budget, Members raised, time and again, issues about the  complexity and transparency of the information available, the elongated process  and whether the information was in a form that was useful to Members. I also  heard criticism of Ministers who did not present information to their Committee  during the Budget process. I am interested to know Members&rsquo; views on how we  might improve transparency, presentation and the way in which we deal with the  budgetary process. However, I will not be taking those matters up with Treasury  officials or Ministers.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  hope that the Finance Minister and the Executive will continue to make the case  that Northern Ireland  should be exempt, as far as possible, from cuts. However, does the Minister  accept that, in making that argument, we need to show the Treasury that we are  prepared to put our house in order financially on issues such as water charges?  How does the Minister plan to make that case to the Treasury?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The Member makes a very important point. I have said  that we will simply not succeed if we hold out our hand and tell the Treasury  that, at this particular time in our economic history, we in Northern Ireland  want to keep all our money or, indeed, want more. We have to make a  comprehensive case.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member is concerned about the way that we have evaded  and avoided the issue of water charges. However, this Assembly has, to a  certain extent, led the way on public sector pay, for example. We are the only  region in the United Kingdom  that has stopped bonuses to senior civil servants. In setting the context for a  tighter pay round, we introduced spend to save measures that encourage  Departments to look forward, and we set aside money in the Budget so that  Departments could make substantial savings in the future, the criteria for  which were designed to ensure that Ministers and Departments did plan ahead to  make those savings. I am sure that the issue of water charges will be raised  when I meet the Treasury Minister. He knows it is my view that, if we are going  to dip into people&rsquo;s pockets, we have to ensure that the House has taken the  necessary action to make all available savings and has collectively addressed  the cost of administration and some of the consequences that that may have for  each of us. That must be done if we are to persuade people that we are serious  about efficient public spending.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. In answer to Mr Farry&rsquo;s question,  the Finance Minister said that this House will have to take all measures  possible before it dips its hands into the taxpayers&rsquo; pockets. Therefore, does  he agree that the Exchequer will find it strange that he, as Finance Minister,  was not present for the debate on how the Assembly and Executive deal with the  Dublin Government and bring forward policies that will benefit both economies  on this island? Surely, the Exchequer would say that he should be working with  his nearest partner to reduce waste.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I do not want to give the Member a lesson in how the  business of this House is conducted. However, he knows that the Business  Committee decides whether a debate requires a ministerial response, and, if it  does, the relevant Minister is assigned to be in the House to answer the  debate. I can only assume that his colleagues on the Business Committee were  happy that that debate did not require a ministerial response.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">My record shows that I do not run away from the fact that  we live on an island where there are certain cross-border economic  relationships that we cannot ignore. That is unlike the Member&rsquo;s party, which  wants to ignore that most important of relationships between this part of the United Kingdom and the rest of the United Kingdom,  with which we do the vast majority of our trade, from which we get the vast  majority of our investment and from which we get an &pound;8 billion subsidy every  year. Whether in my previous role as Environment Minister or in my current role  as Finance Minister, my record is not one of ignoring the existence of the  Republic or of not engaging with its Ministers. We have to get this into  perspective.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  Will the Finance Minister tell the House what preparatory work he has done and  submitted to the Treasury to protect the block grant for Northern Ireland?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: We are working in the dark at the moment. We have  not had a comprehensive spending review. We do not know when that will start,  over what period it will last or what period it will look at. Before the  election, we made the case to the previous Government that we needed certainty.  We have already put down a marker that it would be difficult to sustain very  deep cuts to a Budget in the middle of a financial year in which, following a  huge debate, we have already reallocated money and Departments already have  their spending programmes in place. We have signalled those warnings to the  Treasury. We have indicated that we need some certainty and, at the very least,  a three-year vision so that Departments can plan. In all of this, we can make  our views available to the Treasury, as other Administrations have done. At the  end of the day, Westminster Ministers will make the decision.</p>

      <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Northern Ireland Authority for &nbsp;Utility Regulation</p>
      <p class="OralAnswers-Question">4. <strong>Miss  McIlveen </strong>asked the Minister of Finance and Personnel for his assessment of  the independence of the NI Authority for Utility Regulation and the need for  politicians and departmental officials to avoid any actions that might  undermine the authority&rsquo;s independence. (AQO 1230/10<a name="AQO1230/10" id="AQO1230/10"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The statutory basis of the Northern Ireland  Authority for Utility Regulation as a non-ministerial Department is central to  the independence of the organisation and to its role of protecting consumers&rsquo;  interests. With that in mind, the Northern Ireland Assembly should have a  particular interest in ensuring that Northern Ireland has a strong,  effective and independent Utility Regulator to oversee the operations and  pricing regimes of the local utility companies. That is particularly important  in the context of maintaining consumer confidence in the developing and more  diverse arrangements for the delivery of utilities in Northern Ireland.  Given the recent fluctuations in utility costs for local customers, the role of  the Utility Regulator has added importance.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer. Will he give an assessment of the need for  and benefits of independence of regulation, particularly when the utility is  publicly owned?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I will address the second part of the Member&rsquo;s  question: it does not really matter whether the utility is publicly owned,  mutualised or privately owned. In a situation in which the normal market and  competition within the market do not operate, of course regulation is needed.  That is especially the case when it comes to utilities, because the utilities  involved, whether they be gas, water or electricity, are of such importance to  individuals and households. First, regulation is important because of the  nature of the products that the Utility Regulator looks after. Secondly, it is  important because of price fluctuations, which we have seen for some of the  products and services that I mentioned. Thirdly, it is important that  independence be maintained, because consumers will always be suspicious if the  party that makes the judgements is seen to have an interest in one side or the  other.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Of course, if a Minister were regulating the utilities,  consumers would tell him or her to bear it in mind that the gas or water  company invests in Northern    Ireland and that some of the utilities come  under the remit of his or her Department. Therefore, from the point of view of  consumer confidence, given the services that the regulator deals with, it is  important that the office is seen not to be on the side of one group or  another.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  Does the Minister support the apparent need for a firm regulatory framework,  specified over a number of years and including targets and measureable  outcomes, for Northern Ireland Water? The introduction of such a framework  would mean that not only the water company but the public and the Assembly  could all have an agreed set of objectives. Everybody would be in the clear,  and there would be no dark corners or misunderstandings.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I know why the Member has identified water. It is important  that we have a regulator, because, as Dr Farry said in his supplementary  question, we may be looking at the cost of water being put directly on  consumers at some stage. If that happens, we must ensure that we have in place  an organisation that does not squander the money collected. The organisation  must also have an investment programme that is designed to reduce the cost of  water.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A good, clean water supply and a proper sewage disposal  system are important for public health, so it is important that Northern  Ireland Water be properly regulated and that we have a proper plan for it.  Proper regulation is also important given the effects that a chaotic water  market could have, especially when it comes to sewage disposal, on infraction  fines from the European Union, if we miss targets for reducing pollution etc.  Given that we are to invest about &pound;3,000 million in the sewerage and water system  over the next 10 years, we also want to ensure that that money is spent wisely  and to the best effect.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Given that fuel prices here are  much steeper than anywhere else in Europe, is  the Minister content that his Department and DETI are doing enough to make sure  that the pricing mechanisms that companies employ are fair and transparent and  that the consumer gets the best value for money?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I am not too sure whether the Member is referring to  fuel prices generally or to fuel oil, which has not been mentioned so far. I  emphasise again, however, that it is not the role of my Department, DETI or of  any other Department to regulate the price of fuel in Northern Ireland,  regardless of whether it is electricity, gas or oil. Indeed, if that were the  case, I suspect that people would not be all that happy, because they could  argue that I, as a Minister, had a vested interest in protecting a public  utility. Indeed, if a private utility were involved, it could be argued that I  was perhaps being influenced by that utility&rsquo;s investment proposals. That is  why we have an independent regulator.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Fuel oil is not regulated. The regulator indicated that, if  the Assembly decided that it wished to have fuel oil regulated, he would be  happy for that to be in his remit. However, given that the market for fuel oil  is mature and fairly competitive, we are probably talking about regulation in  energy efficiency, service standards and protecting the vulnerable, rather than  about prices, because the market will tend to regulate prices when there is a  large number of suppliers.</p>
      <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Civil Service: Back Pay</p>
      <p class="OralAnswers-Question">5. <strong>Mr  McQuillan </strong>asked the Minister of Finance and Personnel for an update on the  current status of the Civil Service back pay. &nbsp;(AQO 1231/10<a name="AQO1231/10" id="AQO1231/10"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The vast majority of eligible Northern Ireland Civil  Service staff have moved on to their new pay scales and have received the  associated pay arrears. The next stage of the process is to advise staff of  their individual settlement amounts. That will be communicated to staff  shortly. In parallel, NIPSA is to contact its members who have registered equal  pay claims at industrial tribunals to consult them about the legal process  involved in withdrawing those claims. In addition, the Department will require  staff in the affected grades who have not registered equal pay claims to sign  an agreement to accept the proposed terms of the settlement.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McQuillan</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer so far. Why are the staff who left before 1  August 2008 excluded?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Staff who left before 1 August 2008 are excluded  because equal pay legislation makes it clear that former employees have six  months in which to lodge an equal pay claim with the industrial tribunal. The  proposal is to settle all equal pay claims that NIPSA lodged. On that basis,  those who left six months before the claims were lodged were excluded. That is  the legal position. We would not have the authorisation to spend money outside  what the law requires us to do. Indeed, I would imagine that the Public  Accounts Committee may ask questions if we went beyond the legal remit that the  legislation has given us. The legislation is quite clear, which is why staff  who had left before that date and had not lodged claims were not included.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  Thank you very much, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for those  updated responses. Is the Minister aware that a growing lobby disputes the  outcome of the settlement, given the individual circumstances of some people? I  am referring to recently retired civil servants and to civil servants who were  on secondment for part of the period that the settlement covers. In those  circumstances, will he reconsider the appointment of an independent  adjudication panel to address those issues and formalise outcomes?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Although the Member&rsquo;s invitation to reopen the whole  question may seem enticing, especially to those of us who have been lobbied by  various groups, we must first bear it in mind that the negotiations and their  terms of reference were entered into on clear terms with NIPSA &mdash; the  representatives of the workforce &mdash; and the Department. People knew what the terms  were. Secondly, as I said earlier, we have a statutory framework within which  we must operate. Thirdly, it is not in my power to enter into agreements for  people who are not covered by my Department.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is quite clear that the people in my Department who were  covered were people who worked for the Northern Ireland Civil Service. Once we  open Pandora&rsquo;s box to include those who have retired, how far back do we go? Do  we include those who have been retired for one year, 10 years or 20 years? The  Assembly has debated how we should pay for the pay claim, which has been costly  and may still cost jobs in Northern    Ireland. The Assembly has already seen how  difficult it is to deal with the total cost. For all the reasons that I have  given, although it may be an attractive proposition, I must resist inviting an  independent adjudicator to look at the matter.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  welcome other Members&rsquo; support for retired staff. That support was not so  evident when I raised the issue in the Committee for Finance and Personnel. I  want to ask the Minister about staff employed by the PSNI and other NDPBs who  are equivalent to those in the Civil Service who received the back pay  settlement and who, in many cases, were seconded from the Civil Service. Is  there provision in the budgets of those organisations to make a back pay  settlement, not merely to pay the new scales, which in at least one case, I  believe, have already been agreed? Does the Minister support the position that  those people ought to have the same full settlement as mainstream members of  the Northern Ireland Civil Service?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: First, it would be totally inappropriate of me to  answer for the circumstances in other Ministers&rsquo; Departments. I know that  discussions with the Minister of Justice are ongoing about those who worked for  the Northern Ireland Office and the PSNI. He will have to ascertain whether an  equivalence exists and, if so, what the settlement should be. If that is  agreed, the way in which it will be financed will require the submission of a  business case. The same applies to the NDPBs: each organisation will have to  examine its legal status and the terms of its particular memorandums of  understanding to determine whether there is a requirement.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I suspect that the answer to the first part of the Member&rsquo;s  question is that, since there was not a full appreciation of the nature, cost  and extent of the pay claim, there will not be money in those organisations&rsquo;  budgets. At that point, Departments and bodies will have to make a business  case for the money or decide how to use or reallocate existing resources to pay  for any legitimate claim that is lodged.</p>
      <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">EU Funding</p>
      <p class="OralAnswers-Question">6. <strong>Mr  Kennedy </strong>asked the Minister of Finance and Personnel what improvements have  been made by Departments in the administration of EU funding over the past  three years. &nbsp;(AQO 1232/10<a name="AQO1232/10" id="AQO1232/10"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Under the current round of EU funding, Northern Ireland  has four structural funds: competitiveness, employment, Peace III and INTERREG  IVa. The relevant programme authorities are DETI, DEL  and the Special EU Programmes Body. DFP works closely with all three to  identify efficiencies and promote a culture of continuous improvement. My  Department has also overseen the production of a comprehensive management  control system for the conduct of EU funding in Northern Ireland. The European  Commission subsequently assessed and approved the controls.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that Mr O&rsquo;Dowd is listening so that he knows that I  am not insular and that I do not ignore the fact that we have a land boundary  with the Irish Republic. Quite clearly, he is not  listening.

      <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Multiple Sclerosis</p>
      <p class="OralAnswers-Question">1. <strong>Mr  McCarthy </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  what further services or support his Department intends to offer people with  multiple sclerosis and their families. (AQO 1241/10<a name="AQO1241/10" id="AQO1241/10"></a>)</p>
      <p class="OralAnswers-Question">11. <strong>Mr P  Maskey </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  whether and when people with multiple sclerosis will have access to the drugs  cladribine and fingolimod, given that we have the second-highest prevalence of  multiple sclerosis in the world. (AQO 1251/10<a name="AQO1251/10" id="AQO1251/10"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: With your  permission, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will answer questions 1 and 11 together.  People diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) have access to a wide range of  health and social care services, including physiotherapy; occupational therapy;  community nursing; speech and language therapy; dietetics; social work and  social care; domiciliary care; day care; and daytime opportunities in respite,  including specialist respite care. Their carers are also offered a carers&rsquo;  assessment to determine individual needs. MS patients may also be seen in  consultant hospital services.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">My Department is exploring ways to provide better support,  education and training to clinicians, patients, families and carers of people  with neurological conditions, including those with MS. A disability strategy,  which will include neuro-disability, is being developed. That will complement  existing strategies and partner&shy;ships to improve the health and well-being of  all people with a disability in Northern    Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The drugs cladribine and fingolimod are not yet licensed  for use in the UK.  I would not expect new drugs to be available on the Health Service until they  have been licensed and their safety and clinical cost-effectiveness have been  assessed. People in Northern    Ireland currently have access to a number of  specialist drugs for multiple sclerosis, such as beta interferon.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his response. He may be aware that, recently, the MS  Society held a representative gathering in the Long Gallery. One of its biggest  problems is the lack of provision for neuro-physiotherapy. Will the Minister  indicate when improved and increased physiotherapy for MS patients will be  available throughout Northern    Ireland? I acknowledge that he referred to  that issue.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: There are currently 89  specialist physiotherapists with neurological disability skills in Northern Ireland,  and they are spread across all the trusts. There is a shortage of  physiotherapists wishing to specialise in neuro-physiotherapy. We have a  regional network for neuro-practitioners, and I am also developing an allied  health professionals (AHP) strategy. That will focus on services that AHPs need  to provide and services that we do not provide enough of.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I introduced targets two years ago, and waiting times for  physiotherapy have been transformed. No one waits longer than 13 weeks between  a first referral and first treatment, and I intend to bring that time down. In  June 2008, 1,650 people waited for over 13 weeks, so we have made real strides  and improvements. However, the physiotherapy service requires investment.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: The  Minister will be aware of a disproportionately high number of MS sufferers in  my constituency of East Antrim. Will he  confirm whether neuro-physiotherapists are working exclusively with those who  are suffering from strokes in the Northern Trust area? That is the perception  among those suffering from MS.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The Member will not be surprised  to hear that I am unable to confirm such an assertion. There are 22  physiotherapists with neurological disability skills in the Northern Trust.  There are 174 physiotherapists in the Northern Trust as a whole, many of whom  have the capacity to support both stroke and MS sufferers. I will inquire and  write to the Member. There are an estimated 3,500 MS sufferers in Northern Ireland,  and it is one of the conditions that I would like to do more to support. I hope  that the strategy will help to better inform me on how to focus our services.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McClarty</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s recent announcement of a &pound;50,000 investment to enable  the establishment of an MS network. Does the Minister agree that even more  needs to done to help MS sufferers but cutting the health budget will make it  even more difficult to help MS sufferers and many other worthy causes?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: What Mr McClarty says is  absolutely and undoubtedly true. The people who voted to cut the budget need to  reflect on the patients who are suffering as a result of the cuts. I have  increased investment in disease-modifying therapies. Physiotherapy is an  important part, but disease-modifying therapies through drugs are also a very  important part of the treatment.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Is the Minister aware of or has he  been apprised of the information that is available to the Department on the use  of low-dose naltrexone in the treatment of MS and other illnesses?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I will have to write to Mr  McGlone, as I am not aware of that issue offhand.</p>
      <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Brand-named Drugs</p>
      <p class="OralAnswers-Question">2. <strong>Mr Weir </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety what is the  average cost of brand-named prescribed drugs compared to generic equivalents  and what percentage of drugs dispensed are brand-named. &nbsp;(AQO 1242/10<a name="AQO1242/10" id="AQO1242/10"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: My Department&rsquo;s policy position  is that, in all appropriate circumstances, medicine should be prescribed  generically rather than by brand name. My aim is to achieve a generic  dispensing rate of 64% by March 2011. That is comparable to the current UK rate and will equate to a 50% increase in  generic prescribing in Northern    Ireland since 2007. As a result, I am on  target to create overall efficiency savings from the prescribing budget of some  &pound;88 million.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his response. What strategies is he putting in place to  ensure that generic drugs are used more frequently than brand-named drugs?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Our Go Generic policy is achieving  results, and we have made gains as far as the use of generic drugs is  concerned. When I came into the job only a few years ago, the generic  dispensing rate was 43%, and it is now up at 59%. I anticipate that the target  of 64% will be achieved in 2010-11, which compares favourably with England. We  were far behind England  three years ago, but we are now within touching distance. The generic  dispensing rate in England  sits at 68%, and I anticipate that we will reach 64% next year. Prescribing is  a very much a matter for doctors and GPs, but the Go Generic policy is that  generic drugs will be prescribed when appropriate.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I welcome the initiative from the  Minister and the Department. It is the way forward, but who monitors it? I am  well aware of GPs prescribing brand-named drugs and pharmacists dispensing  generic drugs. How do we follow up on any shortfall to ensure that the money  returns?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The Business Services  Organisation has an important role to play in monitoring and ensuring that  pharmacists give patients the drugs that the doctor prescribed on the script.  It would be a very serious matter if chemists and pharmacists were not  following that process.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We plan to invest in and modernise the entire prescribing  and follow-up process through electronic prescribing. We are moving towards a  new drug tariff that will look not simply at the price of drugs but at the  factory door price. We are also working on the development of a formulary for Northern Ireland.  That is a very important piece of work. Some 8,000 items will be on it, so that  work will not be completed within one year. Those are the steps that I am  taking, together with the establishment of a pharmacy contract, which is in  development. A number of key elements must come together to allow us to get  full value for money from the drugs budget.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  Does the Minister accept in respect of the negotiations on the new pharmacy  contract that there is a need to explore the possibility of giving pharmacists  a much more active and direct role in the prescription of drugs to ensure that  some medics do not abuse their authority by opting out of the prescribing of  generic drugs?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Any suggestion that GPs opt out  of prescribing generics would be a leading remark about our GPs, whom I rely on  as the gatekeepers of the entire system. Anyone who makes remarks like that  must be able to substantiate them.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Pharmacists operate our minor ailments policy, whereby they  may prescribe a number of treatments and medicines without the patient having  to go to a GP. Ultimately, however, the GPs manage that process, and the new  commissioning system that I have put in place is led by professionals on the  ground. GPs are the gatekeepers of the entire system, not just for acute, older  people&rsquo;s or children&rsquo;s services but for our drugs policy.</p>
      <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">DHSSPS: Joint Feasibility Study</p>
      <p class="OralAnswers-Question">3. <strong>Mr P J  Bradley </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  when he plans to publish the joint feasibility study commissioned by his  Department and the Republic of Ireland&rsquo;s Department of Health and Children,  which has been with his Department since February 2009. (AQO 1243/10<a name="AQO1243/10" id="AQO1243/10"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I have consistently said that I  support working more closely with the Depart&shy;ment of Health and Children if  that can deliver tangible benefits to the population. On 29 March, I wrote to  Minister Harney to set out my position on that piece of work. I have considered  the study, and I am not persuaded that the report should progress further at  this time. We will, however, continue to work with the health authorities in  the Republic on practical and deliverable projects that have a clearly defined  benefit for the population, such as the current radiotherapy project at Altnagelvin Area Hospital.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  The Minister said that he is not prepared to publish the report at this time.  Will he give a precise date for publication?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: It is my intention to publish  the study, but it is not, strictly speaking, my property alone. It was a joint  project that was set up by Paul Goggins, the then Minister with responsibility  for health, and Ms Harney. It is half our report, half Ms Harney&rsquo;s. I wrote to  her on 29 March to set out my position. I await her response, and then we will  consider how to move forward. Her agreement is necessary to allow me to publish  the study. Those are the mechanics of the process. I have no problem with  publishing the report, but I must go through the required steps.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Does the Minister agree that, because his is the only Department that has met  its review of public administration commitments and because he is focused on  reducing bureaucracy, now is not the time to set up something new that would  further increase that bureaucracy?</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Members will, in due course, get  an opportunity to read the report and make their own determination. However,  the report that I read does not explain costs or benefits; it asks for further  research, consideration, investigation and so on. I always seek opportunities  for co-operation, but it must be co-operation that delivers practical results  and benefits for the population of Northern Ireland. Although I will  have further discussions with my counterpart from Dublin, as far as I can see, such  opportunities are not contained in the report.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McCallister is right: my Department is the only one that  has delivered all its RPA requirements. The Budget has gone a long way towards  creating efficiencies to allow us to deliver health and social care services in  Northern Ireland.  My Department&rsquo;s budget is smaller than is required to run the Health Service in  Northern Ireland,  and I do not have money left over for extras unless I am certain that they will  deliver benefits.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  find it interesting that the Ulster Unionist Party is harping on about RPA,  given that it blocked the RPA in education. If my party had taken the same  attitude towards health, there would be no RPA in health either. How and ever,  from listening to the Minister&rsquo;s responses on the subject, I suspect that the  reasons for non-publication are political rather than clinical. The Department  of Health is in dire need of financial assistance in using its scant resources.  Surely, therefore, the duplication of services along the border is a drain on  Mr McGimpsey&rsquo;s resources and on those of Minister Harney. The sooner the report  is published and implemented, the better.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The Member will have an  opportunity to read the report in due course. My problem is that I do not see  anything in the report to implement. It is long on discussion and on the need  for further discussion, but I am looking for practical steps.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As far as the cross-border issue is concerned, the Member  accuses me of being politically rather than clinically motivated. Before doing  so, he should take account of my work on paediatric and congenital cardiac  services, suicide prevention, GP out-of-hours provision, child protection and  the satellite radiotherapy facility at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, to name but a  few. If I were as political as he claims, none of that work would be going  forward. Also on the subject of co-operation along the border, I presume that  Mr O&rsquo;Dowd wants me to shut Daisy Hill Hospital  and let all hospital patients go to Louth   County Hospital.</p>
      <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Mental Health and Learning Disabilities</p>
      <p class="OralAnswers-Question">4. <strong>Mr D  Bradley </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  when he plans to bring forward a single Bill on mental health and learning  disabilities. (AQO 1244/10<a name="AQO1244/10" id="AQO1244/10"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Ceist uimhir a ceathair, a LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I presume that Dominic Bradley  means question No 4.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">On 10 September &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:  Order. The standard procedure is that the Member repeats what he said in  English.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: On 10 September 2009, I  announced that my Department would take the lead in preparing a single Bill  which will encompass mental capacity and mental health provisions, to be  introduced in the next Assembly mandate in 2011. Subject to Executive approval,  the wide-ranging Bill will be enacted in 2013, and it will provide additional  protections for those who lack the capacity to make decisions for themselves  about their health, welfare and finances.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Question No 4, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Gabhaim  bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire fosta as an fhreagra a thug s&eacute;. Ba mhaith liom a fhiafra&iacute;  de an gcreideann s&eacute; gur ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh an Bille seo bunaithe ar chearta.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Minister for his response. In his view, should  the Bill be rights-based?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Without getting into the legal  terminology into which the Member may wish to draw me, there are important  benefits in the Bill as far as mental capacity and mental health provisions are  concerned. The Bill&rsquo;s purpose is to put in place substitute decision-making  arrangements for those who are unable to make their own decisions. However,  that process must include strong protections for the individuals concerned. It  will have a wide application and cover decisions about a person&rsquo;s medical  treatment, welfare and financial affairs. As far as possible, it will also  encourage participation in the decision-making process to ensure that the views  of the patient and others are taken into account. It is very much about  ensuring that decisions are made in the best interests of the individual concerned.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  Will the Minister state whether epilepsy will be covered specifically in any  such Bill?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: This issue very much follows on  from the strategy that came from the Bamford Review of Mental Health and  Learning Disability, which includes dementia, autism and acquired brain and  stroke injury. Epilepsy would not be covered by a Bill that encompassed mental  capacity and mental health provisions. However, that is not to say that  patients who suffer from epilepsy will not be covered; they will be covered,  but perhaps because of another condition that they have, such as a learning  disability.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  welcome the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to a single Bill. I believe that Northern Ireland  has the opportunity to be a world leader in the area. What actions can his  Department take in advance of the next Assembly&rsquo;s consideration of a Bill,  particularly on the Bamford action plan and any equality impact assessment of  the legislation?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Health,  Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The equality impact assessment will be  consulted on in August of this year. I plan to have the policy cleared by the  Executive in the autumn as we move to drafting the single Bill. I have  cross-departmental support for implementing the Bamford review, and I am moving  forward with that. All the Ministers who are involved are, without exception,  very positive about the Bamford agenda.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Members who were due to ask questions 5 and 6 are not in their  place.</p>
      <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Tyrone County   Hospital</p>
      <p class="OralAnswers-Question">7. <strong>Mrs  McGill </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety if  he can confirm that funding will be made available to proceed with the newbuild  for Tyrone County Hospital.  (AQO 1247/10<a name="AQO1247/10" id="AQO1247/10"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I assume that the Member is  referring to the Omagh local hospital, which is to be built at the Tyrone and Fermanagh Hospital site. I reaffirm my continued  commitment to the Omagh local hospital. However, given the current financial  climate and the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the next CSR process, I  must look at all my priorities and be certain of the availability of funding to  build and operate the facility before the Omagh project can progress. That is  the position for all infrastructure projects in my planned programme.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  response. However, I must say that his answer was not very encouraging. Will  the Minister confirm that that local enhanced hospital, as it started out, was  deemed to be a priority and that he wanted to proceed with it as soon as  everyone agreed that it should go ahead? It is still unclear why there is a  delay.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I would have thought that the  reason is obvious. I reaffirm my continued support for the Omagh local hospital  and the changes that we made to it, which mirror the Developing Better Services  programme. The local hospital has seen an increase in activity and it is busy,  so I can easily justify the expenditure and investment there.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The procurement process underwent a review, and I explained  to the House that I was given a financial profile that allowed only for PFI.  When that was no longer value for money, I had to look at other options. I must  also look at reviewing the financial profile of the Department&rsquo;s capital. So  far, however, I have done so without success. In addition, I have to do a  business case, but I have to be certain of the financial settlement. I remind  Mrs McGill that her party voted to take &pound;700 million of efficiencies from the  Health Department&rsquo;s budget. I also remind her that, when the House was deciding  whether the Health Department should be exempt from financial cuts, Mrs McGill&rsquo;s  party voted for cuts to the health budget. A few weeks ago, a Budget came  forward that took &pound;115 million from the health budget. Again, Mrs McGill&rsquo;s  party voted for that. I find it somewhat ironic to hear the Member telling me  that Omagh is a priority for her and that she cannot understand the problem,  because not once or twice but three times she voted to take money away from  health. I did not notice that point in any Sinn F&eacute;in manifesto.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Deeny</strong>: I  listened to the Minister&rsquo;s statement on finance. Now that the people of Tyrone  are losing a third acute hospital, surely he realises how those people feel  about him and his Department. Surely he must commit to the hospital on clinical  grounds and on safety and health grounds. In Omagh, we are delighted with the  cardiac unit and the X-ray services. Will the Minister give those people a  commitment? On clinical grounds, the people of Tyrone need this hospital in  Omagh, including continued cardiac and acute psychiatric services.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: For the third time, I repeat  that I remain committed to the project. I also remind Dr Deeny that there is a  financial bill to it all. The Omagh hospital will cost a considerable sum of  money, but, when I put it to the Committee that we were looking at &pound;190  million, Mr Deeny told me that he would not give me 190p for it. It is a pity  that, at the time, Dr Deeny and others were not prepared to get behind my  proposals. If they had, maybe now I would be a bit further on with delivering that  vital investment for the people of Omagh and the surrounding area.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  Is it possible to give a timeline for the completion of the new Tyrone County   Hospital?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: It is difficult to be absolutely  certain about a timeline for completing the hospital. Everything depends on  ensuring that we have the money. As part of the business case, I have to  ascertain that the money will be there, not least the money to build it but  also the revenue to run it. I remain committed to this hospital, because there  is a clear need for a local hospital in Omagh. I have invested quite a bit of  time, effort and, as Dr Deeny pointed out, political capital in pursuing the  project, and I will continue to do so.</p>
      <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Carrickfergus Primary Care Centre</p>
      <p class="OralAnswers-Question">8. <strong>Mr  Hilditch </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety if  the business case has been finalised for the level 2 primary care centre in  Carrickfergus. (AQO 1248/10<a name="AQO1248/10" id="AQO1248/10"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The Northern Health and Social  Care Trust has been asked to develop a business case for a health and care  centre in Carrickfergus. Determining the availability of funding to support the  project is a key element of that process. Until a business case has been  submitted and assessed by my officials, I cannot give a commitment to this or  any other project in the planning stage. In addition, given the financial  climate and the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the next CSR, I must  look at all projects and be certain of funding availability before any of them  can progress.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hilditch</strong>:  On the back of recent news about further cuts and the reduction in facilities  at Whiteabbey Hospital and given the potential  benefits for the community, would it be reasonable for the Minister to think  about prioritising the level 2 healthcare centre for Carrickfergus?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: All those factors will be taken  into account. As I am sure the Member is aware, the point of situating a health  and care centre in Carrickfergus is to co-locate the community teams in a  one-stop shop, integrating primary and community care needs. Bringing the  Carrickfergus project onto the list was one project, among others, about which  I felt strongly. However, capital funding remains an obstacle. Until I have  absolute certainty, I would be misleading the House by saying anything other  than that it remains in question.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Does the Minister accept that a primary health and care centre for  Carrickfergus and, indeed, Larne would reduce some of the pressure on Antrim Area   Hospital and that there  is a degree of urgency about pursuing it?</p>      
      <p class="B3BodyText">If capital funding is not available, is the  Minister considering alternative funding arrangements, such as PPPs, that might  enable such a facility to be brought forward?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: All those issues will be  considered when drafting the business case. We are tied into value for money,  which is an overriding Treasury principle, but I do not rule out any form of  funding in order to get the projects that we clearly need, not only in Omagh  but in Carrickfergus and Larne.</p>

      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Dallat] in the Chair)</p>
      <p class="OralAnswers-H1Heading"><a name="8"></a>Question for Urgent Oral Answer</p>
      <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Whiteabbey and Mid-Ulster Hospitals</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Speaker has received noticed of a question for urgent oral  answer under Standing Order 20 to the Department of Health, Social Services and  Public Safety. I advise the House that, when dealing with questions for urgent  oral answer, generally only the Member who tabled the question and the  Chairperson or Deputy Chairperson of the relevant Committee are called to  speak. However, given the issue, the Speaker has agreed that party  representatives with a constituency interest will be given an opportunity to  ask a supplementary question.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText"><strong>Mr Dodds</strong> asked  the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety to explain the  reasons for the bringing forward of closure of services at Whiteabbey and Mid-Ulster hospitals; and if he will intervene to  give time for a review of the decision to be undertaken.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: Patient safety is  of the utmost priority in the delivery of health and social care services, and  I will not compromise on that position. In 2002, the Developing Better Services  programme established that Whiteabbey Hospital and Mid-Ulster Hospital  would be developed as local hospitals without acute services. The transition  towards their new role as local hospitals has been confirmed in a number of  announcements. Changes to the remaining acute services at Mid-Ulster  Hospital and Whiteabbey Hospital  had been scheduled to take place in the coming months. However, the trust has  made me aware of pressing safety issues and difficulties in sustaining the  current level of acute services, which have meant that immediate changes are  required to the current A&amp;E services on both sites and to inpatient medical  services at Whiteabbey   Hospital. The advice of  senior clinicians is clear: this change is necessary within the time frame that  the trust has set.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Northern Health and Social Care Trust and the Health  and Social Care Board have assured me that the trusts affected, including the  Ambulance Service Trust, will be in a state of readiness to implement the  change as planned. In addition, the trust will ensure that the minor injuries  services provided on both sites from next Monday will be supported by medical  cover for two months so as to provide a safe transition to the new model of  service.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dodds</strong>:  The question that I tabled refers to Whiteabbey  Hospital and Mid-Ulster  Hospital, but my remarks will mainly  be about Whiteabbey   Hospital. I am sure that  Members from Mid Ulster will want to comment on their own constituency  interest.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am grateful to the Minister for his reply. However, he  will be aware of the great distress and anger that has been voiced in my  constituency and further afield at the suddenness of the decision to bring  forward the closure of services. It has had a major impact on patients,  prospective patients and staff. When I visited the hospital on Friday, I spoke  to consultants, doctors, staff and auxiliary staff, all of whom were extremely  perturbed by what they see as a breach of the agreement, which was that the  A&amp;E and cardiology services would be moved to Antrim Area   Hospital in 2011.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">When I met Colm Donaghy, the trust&rsquo;s chief executive, on  Friday, he said that it was not a question of money; therefore, it must be a  question of management, because the situation, as outlined by the Minister, did  not happen overnight. What makes it an emergency now, when it was not an  emergency previously? I ask the Minister, instead of approving the proposal  from the Northern Health and Social Care Trust, to take time to review it and  to allow the decision to go ahead as previously for a transition next year. Why  have cardiology services been included in the transfer of services from Whiteabbey Hospital? Will the Minister address the  issue raised by staff and patients about the ability of Antrim Area   Hospital to cope?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Mr Dodds made a number of  points, and I will try to address them as best I can. With regard to the  timescale, the matter was consulted on and agreed on as the way forward in  2002, so there has been a long run-in period. When I came to the Department of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety, my view was that we would sustain  those services for as long as possible and for as long as patient safety  allowed. The overriding principle is patient safety: it is literally your lives  in their hands.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Dodds asked what had changed. Let me answer him: senior  clinicians are leaving the hospital and the service. The senior accident and  emergency consultant told me on 26 April that she could no longer sustain the  service safely, following the departure of staff on 24 May, and I had no choice  but to follow the guidance laid down by senior clinicians working in the  trusts. With regard to staff, I regret the short period of consultation, and I  will certainly take steps to ensure that unions are better informed and better  included in any subsequent decisions that have to be made on any other sites.  No staff will lose their jobs, there will be no redundancies, and all service  staff will maintain their employment on the current site; however, it will  affect doctors and accident and emergency nurses. I am assured by clinicians  and the trust that Antrim   Area Hospital  can cope and that the strengthening of the service by the addition of staff  from Whiteabbey and Mid-Ulster hospitals will create a better service in  Antrim.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">At present, more than 70% of visits to the accident and  emergency departments at the Mid-Ulster  Hospital and the Whiteabbey Hospital  involve minor injuries, so we are not talking about all visits. Of the  remainder, several will not involve admissions. I have sought and been given  the assurance that with the changes that are being laid down in Antrim Area  Hospital, such as additional beds, the changes to the accident and emergency  department will all be accommodated.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I would have preferred the service to continue for as long  as possible, and I made that clear to the trusts on a number of occasions.  However, when the senior accident and emergency clinician and her staff told me  that patients could come to harm given the vulnerability of the service, I had  no choice but to act.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mrs  O&rsquo;Neill)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. This decision, which  was signed off by the Minister last September as part of the CSR proposals,  compounds the dereliction of health services in mid-Ulster and, again, the  people of mid-Ulster have been stripped of a health service. Some people will  no longer live within the so-called golden hour of access to hospital services,  and the Minister is quoted as saying that that time frame is key to survival  rates in emergencies. People living in Pomeroy, for example, will not be able  to access a hospital within an hour.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The sudden move is a disgrace. The Minister has abandoned  the people of mid-Ulster and stripped them of their services. When the proposal  was first mooted in the CSR proposals, we were told that nothing would happen  until there had been full consultation with staff. The Minister said that there  had been a long run-in period and that the decision had been in the ether since  2002. That may well be, but staff learned of the decision in the media last  week, which is disgraceful and unacceptable. Morale is low. The Minister has  not consulted trusts&rsquo; staff and could not possibly do so within the two-week  period. We were also told that the move would not happen until Antrim Area   Hospital had the capacity  to cope.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister assure the House that additional capacity  has been made available in Antrim   Area Hospital?  I am sure that it has not. Indeed, we have heard reports this morning of an  18-bed trolley wait, which is disgraceful. Will the Minister tell the House  what investment has been made in Antrim   Area Hospital  to allow staff to cope with the change? We are clearly of the view that they  cannot. Furthermore, what consultation has he undertaken with staff? Staff have  said that that has not occurred.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I am entitled to answer one of  those questions and to pick the one I want to answer. The Member should be  careful about going on and on and on and on. I am trying to give the House the  necessary information.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I remind the Member that the Developing Better Services  document was developed in 2002 by a devolved Minister from her party. Sinn  F&eacute;in&rsquo;s fingerprints are all over DBS, and that party cannot walk away from  responsibility. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span> The Member&rsquo;s comments  on the stripping of services are highly emotive and are, in fact,  scaremongering. There is no question of stripping services away from the Mid-Ulster Hospital <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span> The Members from Sinn F&eacute;in can ask me questions, or they can catcall and shout  at me from a sedentary position, but DBS is a Sinn F&eacute;in as well as an Assembly  plan. That party envisaged that the closures would occur at the Mid-Ulster and  Whiteabbey hospitals, and I have ensured that both have a long life ahead of  them. My Department did a similar thing with Omagh, although that hospital as  well as the Mid-Ulster and Whiteabbey hospitals need investment. Sinn F&eacute;in can  help by supporting the Health Service in the Budget, rather than voting for  cuts.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The survival of the hospitals is ensured. There will be no  redundancies, and all service staff on those sites will keep their jobs. The  closures will affect nurses and medical staff, and the Department will work  very closely with them. I will also take steps to ensure that the unions are  better informed in the future.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. I have given some latitude to Mr Dodds who tabled the  question and to the Deputy Chairperson of the Health Committee. From now on,  questions must be focused and Members should ask only one question each.  Furthermore, no more remarks from a sedentary position are to be made.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cobain</strong>: I  will try to be as brief as possible. I thank the Minister for his guarantee of  no redundancies on the Whiteabbey site, and I am sure that the staff there will  also be glad to hear that. Can the Minister also guarantee that continuing  investment for the Whiteabbey   Hospital is at the  forefront of his mind?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I can. I recently invested in  both the Whiteabbey and Mid-Ulster hospitals, and I have other investments  planned. That investment will further strengthen both those sites and, as a  result of those investments and the changes to services that I am making, we  will see increased activity in both sites in the same way as in Omagh. Whiteabbey Hospital is very much part of the local  hospital network and will play a key role in relieving the acute hospitals in  Antrim and elsewhere.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Northern Trust will maintain medical cover on both  sites for the next two months to ensure a smooth transition. However, when  people look at the steps that we are taking in the cold light of day, they will  realise that it is better to have the services we have planned, not least  because it will enhance and reinforce the services in the A&amp;E and acute  hospital in Antrim.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I am reassured by and welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comments on redundancies. I also  remember the havoc left by Bairbre De Br&uacute;n when she was Health Minister, and  when she also tried to remove acute services form the Mater Hospital.  Fortunately, the community revolted against that and defended the Mater.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question, please.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  Will the Minister reassure the House that Antrim  Area Hospital  will be able to cope with the increased workload that the closure of the  A&amp;E at Whiteabbey   Hospital will inevitably  create?</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Yes, indeed. I have, of course,  sought that reassurance from the Northern Trust and its clinicians, and steps  are already in place and are being put in place. It will, of course, mean that  a larger team of doctors and nurses will be available to provide care at the  Antrim Area Hospital A&amp;E. Additional space will be provided at Antrim Area  Hospital, where an additional 20 beds are being put in to deal with the  increased demand, and the Ambulance Service is also planning to provide additional  cover. I invested in the Ambulance Service at Mid-Ulster Hospital  at the end of last year. A number of steps have been put in place, and the  necessary arrangements will be in place by 24 May. Medical cover will also be  available on the two sites for two months. This week, I will receive daily  updates from the trust on the implementation of its plan.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>:  Last Friday, I met doctors and other staff at Whiteabbey Hospital.  One of the main reasons why I have been opposed to the location of Antrim Area   Hospital is its  inaccessibility due to the lack of public transport. Not only the patients who  use Whiteabbey Hospital but its staff who do not have  their own transport will be put to trouble. Does the Minister have any plans to  help them? I have benefited from the cardiology unit at Whiteabbey Hospital.  Why is it being moved?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The steps are being put in place  because of the difficulty in attracting the appropriate staff to Whiteabbey Hospital  and to Mid-Ulster   Hospital. In fact, we  have been relying heavily on local doctors on both of those sites, as has been  the case for some time. Everyone knew the plan and intention of our proposals.  It has come out much quicker than I anticipated, and that is because of the  inability to maintain the teams in place.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, all service staff will remain on site, and no  one will lose their job. It will affect doctors and nurses, and the trust will  work its way through with individual staff to ensure that they are accommodated  properly.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  I thank my colleague Mr Dodds for tabling the question. The Minister will know  from previous discussions and debates that there is much emotion in communities  about any downgrading of services. The Minister will also know that the  decision that was taken was certainly felt in the community. Can the Minister  assure the House that adequate facilities will be provided to take the increase  in beds in the acute services from Whiteabbey  Hospital and Mid-Ulster Hospital,  given the fact that, over the weekend and last night, there were approximately  18 trolley waits and other difficulties with people waiting to be seen for a  number of hours? Will he also assure the House that the future of the Mid-Ulster Hospital is safe and that more work will  be done to provide the much needed level of day care procedures, not just the  few that are being carried out here and there?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I am happy to give those  assurances to Mr McCrea. Both those hospitals now have a strong future. They  are very much a part of the network, and they integrate with, support and  reinforce the work done in the acute hospitals. Those hospitals are changing  services, but medical services are changing all the time. Mid-Ulster  Hospital and Whiteabbey Hospital  will still be capable of delivering around 70% of the hospital needs in their  areas. The minor injuries units, which will be in place at both those  hospitals, will accommodate around 70% of the visits that take place currently.  Frankly, the number of visits that occur in both those hospitals is too low to  sustain a service indefinitely. I had tried to do that, but when safety is in  doubt I have no choice but to listen to the views of clinicians.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Staffing is a key part of this situation. The trust and I  will do what has to be done to support staff. I will also take steps to ensure  that the unions will not feel left out in the cold in discussions when a  decision is made.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I was advised of the unsustainable pressures on the hospital  on 26 April, so we had a short time frame in which to work. However, leaving  the medical support in place for two months will help.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I would have thought that the  Minister, being his own man, would have stopped hiding behind former Ministers  or the excuse of not having the finances. If the Minister is looking to invest  in health, surely he can provide a proper health service for the people of  mid-Ulster. That cannot be done safely before Monday 24 May. The Minister  should not hide behind excuses. He has had ample opportunity to reverse the  situation and put adequate provision into the Mid-Ulster Hospital  to ensure that it can continue.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Question.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  If the Minister&rsquo;s colleague would stop talking from a sedentary position, we  could get on with things.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  Twenty beds have been put in place in Antrim Area   Hospital. When will you  put in place the beds to ensure that accident and emergency can continue safely  in the Mid-Ulster   Hospital? You are not  doing that, Minister.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I am surprised to hear Mr Molloy  talking about money being no excuse and saying that I do not have the money but  that is not an excuse.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  You said that it was not a money issue.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Who is talking from a sedentary  position now? He also said that I was hiding behind previous Ministers. It is a  fact that Developing Better Services came from a Sinn F&eacute;in Health Minister in a  previous devolved period. Your party was very much involved, as it was in the  Omagh decision.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  You are hiding behind that.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: You are hiding behind a  sedentary position. There are pressures at Antrim Area   Hospital accident and  emergency that need to be reinforced, and this measure will help those  pressures. Patient safety is key: your life in their hands &mdash; literally. When  senior clinicians tell me that patients can or will come to harm if we carry on  as we are, I have no choice but to listen. I have no choice but to allow those  clinicians to &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  You are a failed Minister.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  A Deputy Speaker should know better.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I was trying not to make reference to that. Remarks should not be  made from a sedentary position. Some people should know that better than  others.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: It is disgraceful for Mr Molloy  to tell me to be a Minister and to ignore the safety considerations of patients  that are advanced by senior clinicians. It is scaremongering and politicking  with a regrettable situation. However, we cannot sustain indefinitely local  hospitals with acute services where it is virtually impossible to recruit the  appropriate staff and clinicians. In the Northern Trust area, our staff are  spread across four accident and emergency departments, and, in future, we will  reinforce by spreading across two departments. The people of mid-Ulster and of  Whiteabbey will benefit, and the network will be all the stronger for it.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Armstrong</strong>:  The Minister said that money was not the only problem. What other factors are  responsible? How does the Minister see the Mid-Ulster  Hospital being developed so that it  can serve all the people of Northern    Ireland in future?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I think that I have covered some  of that, but it is very much a patient safety issue. Had it not been, we could  have continued until the anticipated change date, which is some six months  away. Unfortunately, the view has been expressed that services cannot be  sustained beyond 24 May.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I also believe that Antrim Area Hospital will be able to  cope with the extra workload &mdash; 20 extra beds are going in &mdash; and the investment  that I have planned for it, which I have also planned for Magherafelt and  Whiteabbey hospitals. All those measures will strongly reinforce the plan. I  look forward to Mr Molloy and his party supporting the Health Service&rsquo;s need  for a budget rather than his making remarks from a sedentary position and  acting most unlike a Deputy Speaker.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I now call Mr Patsy McGlone for a concise question.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  My question will be concise, Mr Deputy Speaker, and it will be factual. It is  not scaremongering when I say that a distressed father phoned me last night,  concerned that his daughter was lying on a trolley in hospital. Nor is it  scaremongering when I say that staff have contacted me because they are deeply  concerned about the professional services that are provided in the community in  which they live &mdash; in which I live also &mdash; in the Mid-Ulster Hospital&rsquo;s  immediate catchment area. What guarantee can the Minister give Members today?  The decision to remove A&amp;E services and the high-dependency unit from Mid-Ulster Hospital,  as well as cardiology services from Whiteabbey  Hospital, was taken on the basis that Antrim Area   Hospital would be best  able to cater for them, but quite clearly &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: May we have the question, please?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  That is part of the question, Mr Deputy Speaker. Last night, there were between  14 and 18 trolley waits at Antrim   Area Hospital,  and phone calls were being made to Magherafelt hospital asking for extra beds.  Initially, it was Antrim Area Hospital  that caught the overspill from A&amp;E at the Mid-Ulster Hospital  in Magherafelt.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: That was not so much of a question  as a press release. I can only repeat what I have already explained. The staff  are managing the patient flows and pressures at Antrim A&amp;E, as they do  frequently. A trolley is a mobile bed; patients still get the appropriate  medical and nursing care. The staff still look after them. If patients are on  trolleys, it does not mean to say that staff ignore them. They do not.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As far as changes are concerned, we will reinforce the  staff at Antrim A&amp;E. I am sure that the Member has had discussions with the  clinicians and the chief executive in the Northern Trust, and I encourage him  to continue to do that. The clinicians, who know what they are talking about,  will explain the difficulties that they are facing. This is a step and a change  that the Member knew was coming, except that it has come a number of months  early. That is the unfortunate side of it, but I had no choice other than to  permit it to happen.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: That concludes the question for urgent oral answer. We shall now  return to the business that we left before Question Time, which was the  Question on the motion on all-island economic regeneration.</p>

      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30  minutes for the debate. The proposer will have 10 minutes in which to propose  the motion and 10 minutes in which to make a winding-up speech. All other Members  who are called to speak will have five minutes. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span> May we have silence, please?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly condemns the spate of robberies within  local communities across Northern Ireland; and calls on the Minister of Justice  to produce a more effective strategy to protect citizens&rsquo; private property and  vulnerable people in our society.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We hear constantly on the television and radio and read in  newspapers about the number of robberies that are inflicted on communities throughout  Northern Ireland.  Robberies against the elderly are particularly prevalent, especially around  Christmas time. In March, a pensioner from Newtownards died two months after  she was woken in the night by two teenagers who were in her bedroom demanding  money. After the lady&rsquo;s death, her daughter told the media that, although the  lady was not physically injured, she was terrified. She was very frightened not  only by her ordeal but by what had happened in her area 10 days later, when  another spate of robberies occurred. That tells us that people can be victims  of crime through fear of it, even though they have not been targeted directly.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Similar burglaries have been repeated across Northern Ireland.  It is thought that senior citizens are being targeted by thieves who are  looking for gold to sell to one of the many cash-for-gold companies that  promote such offers. Over Christmas, there were also thefts from ATMs. The  thefts usually took place in rural areas, which is most alarming because, without  access to cash, people in such areas feel isolated.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In 2008-09, 64% of recorded crimes involved property,  including burglary and theft. Thirty per cent of all theft offences related to  vehicle crime, and, according to the latest Northern Ireland crime survey, burglary  represented the highest reporting rate of 68%. It is thought that the main  reason for that rate is the number of people making insurance claims, as they  need a crime reference number to do so. However, many crimes are not reported,  and the most common reason that people give for not reporting a crime is that  they think that the police cannot do anything about it. Burglary has a 12%  clearance rate, which is one of the lowest. Therefore, a new focus and strategy  need to be developed to combat this type of crime, and much goes hand in hand  with community policing. However, many people in residential areas see few or  no police patrols. I wish to make it clear that I do not believe that that is  the fault of the police. I am sure that Members and people across the country are  more than aware that the police lack sufficient resources, especially manpower.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">When there is a spate of robberies in a residential area,  people, especially the elderly and vulnerable, usually become fearful in their  home. The police, through the Department of Justice, need to do more to tackle  burglary, because, after all, it is the highest reported type of crime.  Burglary is more likely to occur in areas in which there is a younger age group  of 16- to 24-year-olds, areas perceived to have a high level of antisocial  behaviour and areas containing single adults with children and those living in  socially rented accommodation. Such crime against the elderly is low, but it  can, nevertheless, have a devastating impact on its victims. It can affect  their health, quality of life, independent living and sense of security.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Fear of such crime is high among the over 60s, and that no  doubt heightens the intensity of our focus. The police have focused on  preventative measures, such as advising people to lock doors. They also advise  people to keep windows closed even when they are at home and especially when  they are away and to set alarms. People are also told to add security measures  such as chains and deadlocks. However, I accept that many households are  vulnerable because of the lack of adequate security measures. Those measures  and initiatives are all well and good, but they do not necessarily solve the  problem. In many ways, that is papering over the cracks. The problem will not  just go away.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We must tackle the serious lack of respect for private  property and get to the very root of the problem. Whether that is done by  education or through various initiatives, we must act now. The right to private  property and the defence of property are upheld in the American constitution.  Sadly, we seem to have less focus on that in the UK, where criminals appear to have  more rights than the victims of burglary. If someone chooses to defend their  property, a burglar can call the police, and the person whose property is being  robbed is then open to prosecution. I have to wonder what kind of society we  live in when the rights of a perpetrator of a crime are put above those of a  victim. There are also many examples of burglars claiming money for injury  sustained on their victims&rsquo; property. That flies in the face of law and the  right to property.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is an acceptance across society that theft is going  to happen and that it will be dealt with as it happens. However, that does not  reduce the anxieties faced by communities. It is a sad reality that, according  to the Northern Ireland  crime survey, 51% of victims of crime feel that no one can do anything about  it. That says a lot about the justice system here.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, I ask the Minister of Justice to look at this  problem in great detail and to go beyond the physical preventative measures to  the social solutions. I look forward to this debate on a very important topic  that needs to be addressed and to the Minister&rsquo;s response.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Adams</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I support the motion. All Members  will have had occasion to speak with distressed constituents who have been the  victims of robbery and assault. The media frequently report that elderly people  have been assaulted, robbed, terrified and sometimes tortured in their homes by  criminals. Last week, we witnessed the bravery of a shopkeeper and a customer  who tackled an armed robber. I commend those citizens.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Several weeks ago, I visited the home of Seamus Fox, a  father of eight who was brutally murdered in west Belfast. Crime, in all its forms, is a major  issue of concern for all citizens and one reason why the transfer of policing  and justice powers was so important. We now have the tools to begin to reshape  our policing and justice systems to take account of the demands and needs of  citizens and to put in place laws and strategies that can protect lives and  property.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In the meantime, the PSNI and other statutory agencies need  to come up to the mark. It is not rocket science. The West Belfast Community  Safety Forum, which was formed two years ago, has a very good strategy for  dealing with crime. Last year, the Criminal Justice Inspection, which is the  independent oversight body, commended the work of the forum, its strategy and  action plan as a template of how anti-community problems could be tackled.  However, thus far, the forum and its strategy have been denied the funding and  resources to make it work. I have requested an urgent meeting with the Minister  of Justice to discuss that issue, and, tomorrow morning, I will meet the PSNI  to discuss those matters further.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I raised with the PSNI the recent decision to scrap the car  crime unit, which was set up to tackle car thieves and death drivers. A lot of  car thieves now steal car keys from people&rsquo;s homes.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The measures that the PSNI could take are straightforward.  It must use the accountability mechanisms that were created to ensure maximum  consultation with local communities, particularly the local district policing  partnerships. The PSNI&rsquo;s significant resources must be refocused on civic and  community policing. Additional resources must be put into areas that have been  identified as hot spots. What is the point of identifying an area as a hot spot  without prioritising it and focusing resources there?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">All other statutory agencies, such as the PPS and the  Probation Board, must examine their failings in those areas. The local Justice  Minister, who has our support, and the democratically accountable PSNI must  work with local communities to improve the quality of life of citizens and to  provide greater protection from criminals and antisocial elements. That is the  crux of the matter, and, in due course, the Assembly must legislate to assist  with that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Community safety, which is the right of citizens to be safe  in their home and in public places, will be one of the most important matters  that we have to deal with. It will also be a matter on which people judge the  institutions as successes or failures.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  I thank the Members who tabled the motion on such an important subject. I will  not be widely contradicted when I say that we are still finding our feet when  it comes to the technicalities and details of our role of scrutinising the  Department of Justice. I welcome the Minister to the Chamber for his first  debate in his ministerial capacity. He will accept that the debate centres on  fear in the community. That fear must be understood and addressed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The PSNI&rsquo;s latest figures show that robberies have  decreased by 0&middot;5%. However, armed robberies have increased by 9&middot;6%. Last year,  burglaries increased by 110 cases, or 0&middot;9%, and thefts rose by 1&middot;4%. Thefts  within dwellings have increased by 20&middot;5%. The overall picture of the crimes  that the motion seeks to address is that we are, at best, standing on the spot.  The Minister will agree that there is definitely room for improvement. Although  I respect the operational independence of the Chief Constable, one of the  positives of having the debate is that my Assembly colleagues and I can press  the Minister directly on behalf of our constituents on achieving those needed  improvements.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The recent spate of ATM thefts in rural areas is having a  demoralising effect on many local communities. Not only is the cash machine, a  local amenity, gone, but people may feel isolated and vulnerable. I welcome the  move to bring in specialist police to tackle that issue in some rural areas, in  addition to their role of combating dissident terrorism. I look forward to an  update from the Justice Minister on that issue.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Attacks on elderly people in their homes are, perhaps,  among the most cowardly crimes that anyone can commit. The previous Secretary  of State produced a strategy and an action plan to ensure the safety of older  people. I ask the Minister of Justice what action has been taken on the back of  that plan, which was published in November 2009.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to make three points about the actions that must be  taken to reduce crime against elderly people and to reduce their fear of crime.  We must remember that living in fear of crime can and does ruin people&rsquo;s lives.  First, we must get more police officers onto the street. I know that that is a  hardy annual, but we must do it. To instil confidence in local communities,  especially the elderly, police officers must be highly visible. They must also  be fully equipped and trained to deal with any eventuality. Is the Minister in  a position to provide an update on the target to deliver 600 officers back to  our streets to fight crime? What progress has been made on reducing paperwork  and the amount of administration in the PSNI?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">My second point is that we must build our local  communities&rsquo; capacity to defend themselves against crime and to help to  reassure those living in fear of crime, especially the elderly. What plans does  the Minister have for the community safety unit, which was previously in the  hands of the NIO and is now in his Department? What initiatives can he  introduce to increase community co-operation and, equally important,  intergenerational co-operation and support?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Thirdly, we must ensure that, when criminals are caught and  found to be guilty, we give them sentences that fit the crime. We must ensure  that those who carry out crimes know that, if caught, they will not get just a  slap on the wrist. We must also have a Prison Service to back that up and which  is fit for purpose to ensure that it can cope with criminals who are taken into  its care and ensure that people come out of prison ready to start a different  life from that of crime.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion and call on the Minister to effectively  review his strategies to protect citizens and their private property and to  address the element and issue of fear in our communities, particularly among  the elderly.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I also welcome the debate. It is particularly timely to probe the Minister&rsquo;s  mind on the issue, which registers so deeply across communities in the North.  My comments will be very much on the right side of the demarcation line between  that which properly falls to the Chief Constable and the Policing Board and  that which is the responsibility of the Minister. In that context, I have four  questions to put to the Minister on four issues, on which, I hope, we will hear  his view today or subsequently.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The first is that, when it comes to burglary and protecting  private property and the vulnerable, the worst type of burglaries are,  obviously, those that are aggravated and lead to death. In that context,  mindful that Jack Straw, the previous Justice Secretary in England,  commissioned a report and accepted its recommendations for tougher laws and  penalties for knife crime and given the awful experience to which Mr Adams  referred that led to deaths in my constituency in West Belfast and in others,  is the Minister minded to introduce a law that would lay down tougher penalties  for knife crime, such as those in the recommendations that Jack Straw accepted  when he was Justice Secretary in London?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, to protect private property and vulnerable  people, the Public Prosecution Service must operate to its optimum, maximise  the management of cases and produce results. The Minister will know of the  concerns around the Public Prosecution Service about what is perceived to be and,  in my view, is a culture of plea bargaining, in which only cases that have a  high likelihood of success are taken forward, leaving families and victims in  the dark about why counsel recommends the dropping or reduction of charges.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Given those facts and all the other concerns about the  management and outcomes of the Public Prosecution Service, is the Minister  minded to initiate a review of the Public Prosecution Service to look at governance,  management, the management of files generally and the concerns about how they  manage particular cases, without crossing into the independence and operational  responsibility of the PPS? Given the profile around that issue, it is about  time for our Government and the Minister to indicate their thinking on that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The third issue is that, independent of a review of the  PPS, there is a wide body of recommendations from the Criminal Justice Inspection  that impact on the wider criminal justice family, the PPS and PSNI in  particular. Many PPS recommendations were made in the original baseline PPS  review by the CJI in June 2007, updated in June 2009, in which the PPS, in a  quite withering way, is indicted for its failure to implement many of the  recommendations of the original baseline study.</p>      
      <p class="B3BodyText">I do not believe that the PPS has the capacity and the  wherewithal to take those recommendations forward. The SDLP view is that a  different body of people &mdash; a panel of specialists and experts &mdash; should be  brought in to ensure that those recommendations are implemented, in  co-operation with the PPS leadership.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Is the Minister minded to create a mechanism whereby the  recommendations that impact on the wider criminal justice family, the PPS in  particular, are taken forward in the absence of the PPS doing so? His  predecessor Minister Goggins considered that issue in autumn 2009, but it  seemed to run out of steam.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McNarry mentioned my final point. Given the need to have  confidence in the way in which the judiciary manages cases and imposes  penalties and the Minister&rsquo;s personal commitment to the creation of a  sentencing guidelines council, is he in a position to confirm whether he  intends to legislate to create a sentencing guidelines council so that the mind  of the judiciary is informed of the views of the wider community without  impeding its independence?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member must bring his remarks to a close.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  Is the Minister minded to bring forward that legislation and, if so, when?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Like other Members, I welcome the fact that the Assembly is debating justice  issues. It allows us a more rounded approach to the issues that affect people  in Northern Ireland.  We look forward to many more occasions such as this one.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Robbery is clearly a major issue in society. It is about  theft with the threat or actual use of violence. The effects are many and go  beyond the loss of property. It also concerns the personal violation felt by  the victims, physically and mentally. Fortunately, levels of crime in Northern Ireland  are generally low. Indeed, as other Members said, our senior citizens are the  least likely to be victims of crime. That said, there can be no room for  complacency. Individual victims are not interested in statistics; they are  interested in what happened to them and what is being done to pursue those who  are responsible. We must also acknowledge the particular effects that  businesses feel. In particular, the small business sector feels especially  vulnerable to robbery, given the nature of its businesses and the fact that  staff work late at night, often in small shops.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The response to the situation must come from across and  beyond the criminal justice system. As other Members said, the PSNI has a major  role, through the prevention and detection of crime. It is, however, for the  PSNI, in conjunction with the Policing Board, to set out the service&rsquo;s  strategic and operational priorities. Indeed, I am sure that the PSNI will take  note of the comments that have been made in the debate.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Attwood stressed the key role of the Public Prosecution  Service. Clearly, the PPS has an important role in the prosecution of offences.  In hindsight, it is a matter of regret that the PPS is so much at arm&rsquo;s length  from the accountability measures for other agencies. I appreciate the fact that  there are good reasons why that has been so, but society is moving on. Although  we should not second-guess the operational decisions of the Director of the  Public Prosecution Service, there are issues about financing and PPS policy  that are matters of public concern, and it is important that we comment in that  context. There is a lack of confidence in the integrity of sentencing, and I  look forward to a consultation, in the short term at least, on a sentencing  guidelines council, which may lead to legislation in due course. We must go  through a process.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We must also ensure that a wide range of responses is  available to the criminal justice system. A community response to some  non-violent offences may be effective. It is not about being soft on criminals;  it is about solutions that work and avoiding situations in which people are  more likely to reoffend.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is a need for a custodial sentence where violence is  involved. At that stage, the Prison Service, along with others such as the  Probation Service, has a major responsibility to work to reduce reoffending.  Virtually everyone who goes into prison will come out of prison some day. It is  important that they go on to lead proper, responsible lives rather than  returning to a life of crime. It is also important that we pick up on the needs  of victims and witnesses and ensure that we have proper strategies and  programmes in place to provide not just services but proper information on how  cases are being taken forward.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We must also look to the wider issue of crime prevention.  Although the Department of Justice and its agencies have a role, those involved  in health and education, as well as those in civil society, have a  responsibility to prevent young people in particular from entering a life of  crime and trying to pick up on warning signs early on and intervene to steer  people in a different direction. Ultimately, the key response that the  Department can make in the immediate future is through community safety  measures. Consultation on a new partnership model is under way, and beyond that  I look forward to seeing a new community safety strategy for Northern Ireland,  as the old one is now out of date.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:  Bring your remarks to a close.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: It  is important that, under devolution, we take full advantage of all Departments  contributing to a more rounded strategy on the way forward.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  I apologise that I will have to leave immediately after speaking; I was  supposed to be at another meeting in the Building at 4.00 pm. I would have  liked to hear the Minister, but my leaving is no slight on him, and I mean no  disrespect or disregard.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I commend the proposer of the motion. It is appropriate that  the motion should be brought at this time. It is a topical and serious issue  that causes much concern across the whole of Northern Ireland. It is difficult &mdash;  indeed impossible &mdash; to lift a newspaper or turn on a television without hearing  of another burglary or robbery. The victims, usually elderly, are left shaken  and traumatised; the independence of many is irreparably damaged. Many live in  fear that the criminal, if he or she is arrested, will soon be back on the  streets carrying on with what they do best. Just this morning, I learned that  an 86-year-old woman was the target of a distraction burglary carried out by a  male who claimed to have called at her home to check the drains. That is  typical of what is going on across the Province. I hope that the PSNI, under  the direction of the Chief Constable, will grapple with the problem.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">My constituency of Fermanagh and South Tyrone includes the  town of Dungannon,  where there has been a 236% increase in violent thefts in the past year. That  is not something that Dungannon is proud of, but it is fact. That is by far the  steepest and sharpest increase in any town or area in Northern Ireland.  I refer Members to a headline that recently appeared in a local newspaper:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Surge in violent crimes in Dungannon&rdquo;.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The report states that:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;A crime wave of shocking proportions has hit the  Dungannon area with a 236 percent surge in violent thefts in the past year, the  steepest rise in Northern    Ireland.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">It goes on to say that:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Dungannon is one of the worst hit districts for house  burglaries with a 54% rise in the past year, and a 48% increase in other  burglaries&rdquo;.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Those figures were released by the PSNI and make  startling reading.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Sadly, Dungannon is one of the worst districts for house  burglaries. It bears repeating that there has been an increase of 54%. That is  enough to cause alarm in anyone&rsquo;s estimation. Those statistics cannot be  overlooked or discarded. Dungannon Court House has 36 alleged robbery-related  offences on its list for this week. Of those charged, six are youths. Those six  cases form part of a total of 12 cases relating to youth-involved robbery in a  court jurisdiction that also takes in Strabane and Omagh. Therefore, according  to the figures, 50% of youth-related robbery in that court jurisdiction takes  place in Dungannon. One of the 36 alleged robberies in the Dungannon and south  Tyrone area is particularly severe and involves an alleged burglary with  threats to kill and cause grievous bodily harm.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">No one can be satisfied with that state of affairs. Indeed,  there is a clear message that something fresh must be tried, because current  legislation is obviously not sufficient. The existing deterrents need to be  looked at again if such behaviour and robberies are to be stamped out. Local  communities need to feel safe in their own homes. Given the level of crime,  particularly in the Dungannon district, can the Justice Minister move to  reassure citizens of focused efforts to drive down crime? The Minister is only  just into his position, and we do not lay any charges at his door. However, he  has a big task ahead of him and needs the support of the whole community and  the House.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I recently spoke out about the availability of ASBOs. There  are currently 39 ASBOs in place in Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Bring your remarks to a close, please.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  I will. Significantly, not one of those ASBOs was served in the Fermanagh and  South Tyrone constituency.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Like all the other Members who  have spoken, I commend Mr McCrea for bringing the motion to the Assembly this  afternoon. I have no hesitation in giving my support and that of my party to  what is a timely and welcome motion. It is a difficult topic to deal with as it  involves victims of crime, sometimes very serious crime, across our community.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Colleagues have already referred to particular incidents of  crime. The proposer of the motion acknowledged the importance of reminding  ourselves that levels of crime continue on a downward trend across the  spectrum. However, that does not in any way alleviate the trauma suffered by a  victim of crime; that has to be stated and restated. We want to commend everyone  who is involved in trying to tackle these matters at local level, whether that  is a local community safety forum, a DPP, the PSNI or another statutory agency.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I do not know the full detail of the situation in  Dungannon, but the statistics are startling. It is important that the issue be  dealt with specifically and locally in Dungannon, which has a vibrant DPP. The  DPP and the police need to get to grips with the trends underlying those  figures in the first instance, because we have to have strategies. The PSNI has  a responsibility to detect and prevent crime, and the DPPs have a statutory  responsibility to monitor the effectiveness or otherwise of policing plans in  any area. It is important that there is a clear understanding of what is  causing the sort of rise in statistics that Mr Morrow outlined.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I should have declared my membership of the Policing Board  before I spoke. The Policing Board is often made aware of the specifics, trends  and patterns of local crime. We have introduced a new objective in this year&rsquo;s  policing plan, namely to increase the level of reporting of crime. As the  proposer of the motion mentioned, it has long been understood that there is an  ongoing under-reporting of crime. Indeed, the PSNI would say that, at the  highest level, only 40% of crime is reported. The Policing Board has embarked  on a strategy with the PSNI this year, and the objective is for at least 50% of  crime to be reported. That will mean a 10% increase in the statistics by this  time next year, although, hopefully, that will not reflect a 10% increase in  actual crime. Our theory is that, if the extent of the problem is not  identified, adequate resources cannot be allocated to tackling it.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important, on a number of fronts, to support the  motion, and our long campaign to have policing and justice powers transferred  to a locally elected representative has been critical. Now, we have a Minister  who is elected by this society and accountable to this society through this  Chamber. The transfer of powers has successfully been concluded, and we have a  Minister in place. It is early days yet, but we must quickly revisit the  amended Programme for Government. Therein lies the solution or the genesis of a  solution to issues such as this. Through the Programme for Government, we can  provide the means of getting a combined strategy that tackles everything from  the sentencing guidelines council through to preventative measures and the way  in which we ensure that offenders who emerge from prison do not become repeat  offenders. I commend the Minister, and I urge him to apply the political will,  as the Minister of Justice representing this Chamber and our community, to  ensure that all the agencies work together properly.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The style of policing in the community is essential to the  delivery of policing. If the police do not work to secure the full support of  the community in an organic partnership, they will not be properly equipped to  tackle these matters. It is crucial that the style of policing in the community  is agreed on as soon as possible. That obligation lies with the PSNI.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member please bring his remarks to a close?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  Furthermore, the role of the district policing partnerships, in the coming  merger with the community safety partnerships, should develop sooner rather  than later.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  Behind every headline, there is more than a crime number or an insurance claim;  there is an individual or family traumatised by the experience of having been  victims of robbery. We must not forget the human element that lies behind each  press headline. Sadly, it is mainly the elderly and other vulnerable groups who  are on the receiving end of some of these robberies.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will never forget visiting an elderly lady who had been  burgled and physically abused by five thugs. Her distress and fear was very  obvious. Sadly, her experience is not unique in East Londonderry or any other  constituency in Northern    Ireland. In some instances, we have seen  pictures of senior citizens who have been murdered or battered black and blue  for a few pounds. They are easy targets, picked on by cowards who want easy  money.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">My colleagues have called on the Minister of Justice to  produce a more effective strategy. However, it looks as though we need to  develop a strategy. I appreciate that the Minister is new to the job, and I  wish him well, but I hope that he agrees that this is an area of his remit  wherein real progress can be made. As I have said, we are not talking about  numbers but about people and families. It is all too easy to overlook that, but  any new strategy must have that consideration at its heart. I am aware that  tackling the problem of robberies is not an easy task, but, unless we do so, we  will allow the thieving scum who indulge in such despicable behaviour to terrify  the vulnerable in their own homes.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There are three things that will be of great help in  addressing the issue. The first is to ensure a higher level of community  policing; the second is to help the vulnerable to secure their home; and the  third is to have a sentencing policy that will act as a deterrent. I also urge  local communities to be as vigilant as possible, particularly around the homes  of pensioners. For all the cost implications, we must not permit people to live  in fear of being robbed in their own home.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">With respect to my first point, people find it reassuring  to see police personnel in the neighbourhood &mdash; on foot, rather than driving  past quickly &mdash; especially in areas where robbery is a problem. My second point  is about a practical way of displaying the Assembly&rsquo;s commitment to tackling  the problem. Doubtless, the Minister will look towards the voluntary sector for  help in implementing that type of approach. As to my third point, those who  commit such acts should receive punishment appropriate to the crimes they  commit. Too often, the perpetrators are given a smack on the wrist and told not  to do it again. That does nothing to deter those thugs from committing such  acts again. Frequently, one hears that individuals with numerous convictions  are fined or given suspended sentences. That must stop, or the system will help  to make worse the problem of robbery.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Let me return briefly to point one. There is another effect  that additional police personnel on the beat may have: they could help to  prevent the street muggings and attacks that are all too frequent.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have mentioned only a small number of points that may be  included in an overall strategy to tackle the rising tide of robberies.  However, I hope that the whole Assembly will support the motion and that the  Minister will begin, as a matter of urgency, the process that is required to  develop a new and workable strategy to tackle the problem. I fully support what  is a very worthwhile motion.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I also welcome the debate. Crime and its effect cannot be reduced to a series  of statistics. Anybody who has had to endure a criminal attack, robbery or  crime of violence first feels hurt, then sometimes injured and violated. The  traumatic effect of that on a person&rsquo;s life, lifestyle and family is very  serious. It creates great insecurity and causes great suffering. Therefore, we  cannot look at the situation simply in terms of statistics.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That having been said, it should be recognised that in real  terms our crime levels are falling, not increasing, which is to be welcomed.  They are lower than those in England  and Wales,  which is, again, to be welcomed. Although any attack on or crime committed  against the elderly should be seen as a terrible outrage, it must be kept in  mind that the volume of attacks or crime against them is lower than that  perpetrated on younger people and their households.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Nonetheless, as I said originally, statistics do not  matter: a crime committed against a person has a deeply traumatic effect.  Therefore, we must seek ways and means to reduce those figures and the  potential threat to those who are older and vulnerable, such as single parents,  children and young people. As legislators, we demand a strong community  policing strategy. A community policing strategy will be most effective in  preventing crime because criminals most fear being caught. It is not the  deterrent effect of sentencing that they fear most, it is being caught. Hence,  community policing and the resources put into it are very important.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We should not see community policing as an add-on to  ordinary policing. Policing at large should be community policing. The position  should be that an ordinary policeman knows his neighbourhood, the colour of  someone&rsquo;s car and the number of children in a household &mdash; he is familiar with  the area and its people. That is how real community policing is delivered.  Achieving that is intensive, but it is the way in which the police can relate  to the community and, importantly, the community can relate to and support the  police.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In dealing with crime, the Minister of Justice has an  enormous task. Of course, as legislators, we must support him. We will use our  critical faculties to scrutinise what he and the various institutions in his  remit do. However, it is important that we are supportive, that we encourage  community policing and provide the resources for it and that we encourage  initiatives such as neighbourhood watch, which is also important and chimes  with community policing. In addition, it is important that we look at  technological means of protecting people, property and homes and that we  provide comfort and support to victims of crime.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Bring your remarks to a close, please.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  The sign of a community that really cares is support for those who have been traumatised  through crime. Victims can take comfort from the fact that their community  truly supports them.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Irwin</strong>: I  very much welcome the opportunity to speak on this important issue, and I thank  my colleagues for tabling the motion. Robbery and the theft of property are  becoming worryingly commonplace across Northern Ireland. Only a few weeks  ago, I suffered the theft of a Land Rover and a cattle trailer from my farm.  Therefore, I fully understand the hassle that such crimes cause to those who  lose property in that way, not to mention the cost and inconvenience to  individuals and businesses. In my case, the people behind the theft used my  Land Rover and trailer to steal cattle from a farm a few miles away from mine.  Obviously, the perpetrators felt at liberty to steal a trailer and a Land Rover  from one farmer and then, using those stolen items, steal cattle from another.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The cost of agriculture-related theft over recent times is  alarming. It seems that there is not a week that goes by when we do not hear of  a farmer being targeted by people who steal their trailers, tractors and  cattle. It is an ever-growing problem, especially in my constituency. However,  although one would perhaps relish catching those individuals in the act, there  is a more sinister and brutal aspect of stealing that has become prevalent in Northern Ireland:  incidents of our elderly constituents being robbed. When someone is confronted  and attacked by a masked gang in their home, they must watch, in fear for their  lives, as their belongings are ransacked and valuables taken. That is a most  horrendous ordeal.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Only a couple of years ago in Tandragee, an elderly council  colleague, Councillor Heather Black, went through the trauma of having masked  men in her home looking for valuables. The effect on her was devastating.  Recently, another pensioner in Mountnorris was attacked, and the money that he  had saved for Christmas was taken. I think that five bold men were involved in  that attack in which an elderly man was robbed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is no surprise that robbers target the elderly because  they know that their victims will be unable to show any great resistance. The  callous individuals who are behind those incidents may think that they are on  their way to a fast buck. The reality, of course, is that real damage is done  in the form of the pain and trauma that is left in the wake of such attacks. I  have spoken to elderly people after such attacks, and it is apparent that,  although the bruises heal, the emotional scars remain for a long time. We must  consider the effects that those attacks have on the elderly population. They  live in fear after such attacks. That is an unfortunate reality.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Robbery and the theft of property represent a blight on our  communities and are most damaging to the most vulnerable in our society. I echo  the calls of my colleagues for a more effective strategy to protect the most  vulnerable and, indeed, to reverse the growing perception that the thugs who  are behind the crimes are getting away with it while the victims are left to  pick up the pieces. That, undeniably, ties in with the need for greater  resources for the PSNI and the great need for a visible deterrent. Police  patrols are not as visible as they used to be, and that must be addressed. We  owe it to our elderly especially and to all our law-abiding citizens to tackle  this growing problem. I support the motion.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I support the motion. It seems that, when we hit times of economic crisis, the  number of robberies and burglaries escalates. That has certainly been the case  in my constituency of Strangford. I carried out a computer search of my press  releases concerning robberies in the past six months, and there were 17.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That is not every one, but it indicates the number of  incidents that have taken place. To some people, that may not seem like many,  but there would have been a lot more if every robbery had been reported to me.  My point is that there are clearly issues in the area that I represent.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">5.00 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The district policing partnership &mdash; I declare an interest &mdash;  decided to work with the PSNI to support an initiative to address the spate of  burglaries in Ards town centre. In the past six months we have had a tiger  robbery, the robbery of a Securicor van at Ards Shopping Centre and a smash and  grab at a filling station. Things seem to have escalated to a horrifying scale,  and it is clear that decisive and affirmative action must be taken. It is a  shame and a disgrace that, over a few weeks, there was a concerted spate of  robberies on elderly people in Newtownards town centre. Elderly and vulnerable  people have been subjected to a level of theft, and it is clearly distressing  that they were targeted at all.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I yin kirk thair wur a wheen o&rsquo; parishioners at wur robbed  oan a Sabbath morn quhan aa thair prayers. They aa heided tae church i thair  normal wie an&rsquo; cum hame tae differ amoonts o&rsquo; devestation es thair hooses hed  bein ransacked an&rsquo; veluables tuk&rsquo;. Hit&rsquo;s clear at thon wus a concerted an&rsquo;  dedicated attack oan fowk fae thon kirk at hed a set wie o&rsquo; gaein an&rsquo; preyed  oan fowk gaein tae church.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">One Sunday morning, several parishioners from the same  church were robbed while worshipping. They all left church according to their  normal pattern and came home to varying levels of devastation. Their homes had  been ransacked and their valuables stolen. That was clearly a concerted and  dedicated attack on members of that church by people preying on those with  established routines.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There was also a spate of targeted robberies in the east  end of Newtownards, where elderly people were robbed at home. One elderly lady  awoke to see intruders in her room. She was a sweet little lady who was well  loved by all who know her. She was also a little bit fiery, but her years meant  that most people would have been careful. One intruder kept her prisoner while  another went through her things. Not long after that, the lady died. Despite  her bravado, I believe that the robbery played a great part in her death. She  is not the only lady in that part of town to have been robbed, which is why I  contacted the PSNI to address the issue. In particular, with the help of the  East End Residents Association, I spoke to the crime prevention officer for the  area in order to highlight elderly people&rsquo;s safety needs and to discuss ways to  make the town safer. The meeting was a success, and a large number of elderly  people came to the office to get free door alarms and details about additional  locks. The horrific robbery of that elderly lady in the town was followed  shortly afterwards by other robberies in the Glen.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Through its crime prevention officers, the PSNI is able to  assist people and give advice about security measures and aids. However, it was  right to bring the motion before the Assembly, because the Minister of Justice  needs to know of the blight. We must work with crime prevention officers.  However, I am disturbed to hear that the PSNI will no longer utilise crime  prevention officers but turn instead to civilian posts. I am not saying for a  second that a civilian could not do the job, but a person with 25 years&rsquo;  experience as a crime prevention officer is the sort of person that a community  needs to have in place, so I suggest that that is what we should be doing. Is it  not better to go to a crime prevention officer who has knowledge and expertise  and is able to give advice and allay fears? That must continue, as well as  having an effective and co-ordinated strategy to handle burglaries and  robberies.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have no doubt that the PSNI is a superior force and that  its officers work hard; however, it needs to have resources in place. Although  the Minister of Justice is new to his post, he will know that no matter what  area of the Province one is in, in recent months, the number of robberies and  burglaries has increased, so now is the time for action. That is what the  motion asks for, and that is why I support it. I congratulate my colleagues on  tabling it, and I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s response. I know one thing:  the crime prevention officers in Ards need to be kept in place.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice (Mr Ford)</strong>: Before today, I never realised why Ministers need so  long to respond to debates. Nonetheless, I welcome the opportunity to respond,  and I congratulate Ian McCrea and Trevor Clarke on securing the debate. I thank  all Members who participated. Since this is my first opportunity to respond as  a Minister, no one seems to have given me the blame. Doubtless, things will  change.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is clearly the view of every Member in the Chamber that  all citizens, particularly the most vulnerable in our community, have the right  to live safely in their home, free from fear and the threat of being burgled.  Although Members mentioned different instances in which senior citizens have  been burgled, we must recognise that, statistically, crimes against older  people are, thankfully, relatively rare in this society. However, we all  acknowledge that one crime is one too many. As a number of Members said, the  burglary of a domestic dwelling can have a devastating impact on a vulnerable  person &mdash; indeed, not only on that person but on their family, their friends and  the wider community.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In Northern Ireland,  the risk of becoming a victim is much lower than it is in England and Wales, the only area for which we  have directly comparable statistics. In recent years, that gap has widened, so  the risk is now even less. We all know that there are particular difficulties  in particular areas. Indeed, Mr Adams highlighted the hot spots in his West Belfast constituency.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The bulk of the debate focused on domestic burglary.  According to the NISRA comparison of crime surveys, the comparative figures  show that the recorded crime rates for domestic burglary in Northern Ireland are less than four fifths of  those for England and Wales. Of  course, we have to take account of the level of reporting, but those are the  crime surveys, not instances of the police receiving reports directly after the  event. As a result, they are probably the most reliable statistics, and Alex Maskey,  with his experience on the Policing Board, made that point.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Not only is our burglary rate lower than that of England and Wales, but, in absolute terms, we  are making progress. The number of domestic burglary crimes has fallen over the  past seven years from roughly 10,000 to 7,270, which is the figure for  2009-2010.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We heard examples of particular issues. For example, Lord  Morrow mentioned the large increase in robberies in his area. The number of  robberies in the Dungannon and south Tyrone district increased from 13 to 41.  That may be a high percentage increase, but the number of burglaries is low.  The Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency has a very low crime rate compared  with the rate for Northern    Ireland, which we know to be low for these  islands. We must face the fact that there has been an upswing in the number of  burglaries, although, thankfully, it is a relatively small one. As Jim Shannon  said, the upswing is largely down to economic issues. As we heard from all  sides of the Chamber, there is absolutely no doubt that there are still too  many victims of domestic burglary, and I want to ensure that all victims of  crime receive the highest standards of service from the justice system.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will shortly announce a programme of work that is  specifically designed to improve victims&rsquo; experience of the criminal justice  system, and it will include a new code of practice setting out the minimum  standard of service that people can expect. The Department of Justice supports  Victim Support Northern Ireland  to the tune of more than &pound;2 million per annum in grant aid to assist it in its  work in supporting victims. The justice Bill, which we hope to see introduced  later this year, will make further provisions for victims. In particular, it  will provide for the establishment of an offender levy, which will be used to  create a victims of crime fund, and for the introduction of special measures to  assist vulnerable and intimidated witnesses when giving evidence in criminal  proceedings. As other Members said, that will ensure that people are not only  caught but caught and convicted safely, with good evidence being given against  them.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  Does the Minister agree that the perception in the community is largely that, when  the culprits of heinous crimes are caught, their punishment does not fit their  crime?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I think that my colleague may have been reading a few lines  further down my notes from over my shoulder.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A range of contributions is to come from the Department,  largely to do with ensuring that the PSNI is adequately resourced. It is not  that the Minister should be second-guessing the Chief Constable&rsquo;s operational  decisions. Rather, it is about ensuring that resources are there to enable  community policing to move ahead; to support the various regional initiatives  through the Organised Crime Task Force; and to tackle domestic burglary,  through similar regional initiatives and through support for bodies such as  community safety partnerships, enabling them to look at the best local measures  to protect their communities.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As a number of Members said, the Chief Constable&rsquo;s actions  in the resource to risk programme put 600 police officers on the streets over a  very short period, and I believe that in excess of 400 officers have now been  moved from desk jobs to real operational duties. That is one major way of  instilling confidence in the community that work is being done. However, I  suspect that the precise issue as to how paperwork is handled, as well as the  interplay between the Police Service and other agencies, is beyond the scope of  the debate.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As Minister of Justice, I want to see devolution make a  difference. One aspect of that will be the development of a firm, robust and  up-to-date community safety strategy, which will, as my colleague Stephen Farry  said, have to be rounded, multidepartmental and multiagency. It will also have  to involve aspects of the voluntary sector to ensure that we make movement on  building a shared future and that we reduce offending so that we can produce the  safer society that we all need to see. I believe that devolution provides the  opportunity for that more joined-up and cohesive approach to the strategy, and  I look forward to working with the Justice Committee, Members and a variety of  public agencies as we develop that strategy.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The proposals that we are working on to integrate community  safety partnerships and district policing partnerships will provide a more  effective delivery and a better focus so that, alongside monitoring the  performance of local police, local communities can look to the real issues of  concern in fighting crime in their neighbourhoods and can see the action that  is needed on that front. I look forward to seeing how that will be shaped as we  engage in further discussions over the coming months. Those proposals will be  in the justice Bill, and they will allow for better local delivery and  accountability for us all.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A number of other issues were raised. My colleague&rsquo;s point  as to whether sentencing is adequate in Northern Ireland needs to be re-examined.  Similarly, prison reform has been highlighted as a matter of concern. Alex  Attwood raised the issue of knife crime, the levels of which are low but  worrying. We need to look at whether there are issues with sentencing  guidelines, alongside the ongoing Knives Ruin Lives campaign, for example.  Those issues cannot be put into legislation this year, as many of them need to  be consulted on. However, I trust that I or my successor will be in a position  to include those issues in a future justice Bill as the work of the Assembly  goes ahead under devolution.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Attwood also talked about reviewing the role of the PPS.  There are clearly issues as to the way in which the PPS relates to the criminal  justice family. However, I am not going to second-guess the role of the future  Attorney General, who will be accountable to the Assembly for the operation of  the PPS, rather than the Justice Department. However, there is no doubt that  the reports that the inspectorate highlighted show a greater need for  involvement where I do have a role, which is in ensuring that the Criminal  Justice Board brings together all the relevant agencies, including the PPS, to  ensure that we have the speediest, most effective, most joined-up and  successful system of justice possible. I will continue to work on that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department is continuing to work on a number of  awareness campaigns that are on the theme that Members talked about, which is  that crime prevention is better than cure. I am not giving Mr Shannon any  promises as to who will carry out the crime prevention role, because it may be  one of those issues where serious consideration must be given to whether it  requires the full authority, as opposed to the experience, of a police officer  to give people proper advice. However, I can assure him that crime prevention  will continue to remain a firm priority for the Department, whatever way it is  carried through. For example, the current awareness campaign, Close it, Lock  it, Check it, is being delivered across the media, and there will be a range of  different opportunities to get that message across. Recently, around 42,000  homes in areas where it was felt that there was a particular need to emphasise  that point, including Craigavon, north and west Belfast and Foyle district command units, received  a home security pack. Those are all initiatives to encourage the public, the  community sector and statutory bodies to work together to ensure that we make Northern Ireland  safer.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As I highlighted, crime prevention officers and the work  that is done by neighbour policing teams in bodies such as Neighbourhood Watch  have a role to play. They work with communities right across Northern Ireland  as we seek to develop and move forward the partnership approach that has  characterised the PSNI in recent years.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Members who took part in the debate. I am  grateful for the acknowledgement that it is early days for the Department of  Justice and that I am not going to be held responsible for everything that has  happened in the past, although, no doubt, that will not happen the next time  that we meet.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">However, it is clear that there are major concerns in this  society. Although the rate of domestic burglary and other robberies is low,  domestic burglary is an important crime area because of the fear that it inflicts  on society, rather than the actual concerns that it creates.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We will continue to work on crime prevention, detection,  appropriate disposals, and we will continue to support victims. Although there  has been some success in reducing the level of burglary, and although we face  particular difficulties in the current economic circumstances, more remains to  be done, and we will do it.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">5.15 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  I apologise for not wishing the Minister well in his new post during my earlier  comments. He referred to the work he intends to do to encourage people and make  the vulnerable feel safer at home. Will he also take on board the statistics  for unreported crime and encourage those who fail to give information to the  police to do so? That is equally important in tackling the problem.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I take the Member&rsquo;s point and thank him for his good wishes. Alex  Maskey raised that point in the context of the work being done by the Policing  Board, and the statistics I quoted were taken from the latest Northern Ireland  crime survey rather than the number of reports to the police, as the figures  appears to be more accurate. It will be a success if, next year, there is an  increase in reported crime with no increase in actual crime. I trust that  Members will explain to the public, as we debate this issue in the future, why  greater reporting of crime is a success and not a bad thing, as superficially  appears. There is a real issue around getting the statistics correct so that we  can target resources to where they are needed, and I look forward to the Member  and his colleagues supporting me on that issue.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is no doubt that we are now engaged in working to  ensure that devolution delivers and that we have an overall community safety  strategy for Northern Ireland in which this area can be set alongside others as  part of a coherent overall package. We can also make Northern Ireland a safer  place and build on the work done by CSPs, DPPs and the wide range of voluntary  organisations that work with the institutions of the criminal justice system.  There is much more to be done, but under devolution we have the opportunity to  develop an effective response in partnership with the range of agencies  involved. The entire House and community want to see devolution delivering.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>: I  declare an interest as a Member of the Northern Ireland Policing Board. I thank  all Members who took part in this worthwhile debate and my colleagues who  tabled the motion.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am very heartened today, because there has been unity  across the Chamber on robberies and burglaries, which are serious issues for  all of our communities. We have also seen the brutalising of many of our  elderly folk &mdash; a theme that emerged throughout the debate &mdash; particularly in  relation to thugs who enter the houses of the elderly and the vulnerable and  very often come away with small amounts of money, yet leave those people living  in fear. Most Members were on the election trail over the past number of weeks  and saw old folk locking themselves in their houses even before it got dark.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  I apologise to the House for being absent for the debate. I was in another  place in the Building.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I visited one elderly woman who leaves money on her kitchen  table frequently. She is afraid that she will be burgled, so she leaves the  money there in the hope that the burglars will take her purse and leave her  alone. I am sure the Member will accept that it is a terrible situation when  elderly people are living in so much fear that they must place money  strategically in their homes. Losing their possessions is not an issue for  them; they are doing it to prevent attack. We have seen so many attacks, and I  am sure that the Member will accept the point that I am trying to make.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>:  Yes, that is the point that I was trying to make, and it illustrates the  genuine fear experienced by the elderly and vulnerable people in our  communities.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The other theme that emerged during the debate was the need  for highly visible and effective community policing. That is how to assure  elderly people and all of the victims in our communities of a police presence  in their area, which makes them feel safer. Highly visible community policing  will deter many crimes. The one fear of criminals is that of getting caught.  Statistics will not prove the good news story that x number of crimes has been  prevented as a result of such policing. The Policing Board and the Department  of Justice are trying to achieve that aim, and I encourage them to move forward  as quickly as possible.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I shall cover some of the issues that Members raised. In  proposing the motion, Ian McCrea highlighted the issue of elderly people being  robbed and described how the fear of crime makes victims feel. He also referred  to the theft of ATMs, and, although that issue did not come up often in the  debate, it has been mentioned consistently by Members. Mr McCrea talked about  the lack of police in some areas, and, in doing so, reinforced up the point  that we want to encourage more community policing. That is the crux of the  matter, and that is what will benefit folks.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Gerry Adams spoke about elderly people in his constituency.  He mentioned the recent bravery of a shopkeeper and a customer who tackled  criminals. He also mentioned the disbandment of the car crime unit in west Belfast, which has done  sterling work in the past number of years. That issue will be raised at the  Policing Board, because the unit dealt with car crime that also affected other  areas, because the cars concerned were used outside west Belfast. Car crime is a problem for all  areas, not only west Belfast.  I and other members of the Policing Board will want to know why the unit has  stopped its operations.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">David McNarry mentioned the action plan for older people  and asked the Minister what action had been taken on that. In response, the  Minister referred to several areas and talked about some of the security  devices that have been provided to elderly people through schemes such as those  run by community safety partnerships.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Alex Attwood raised several issues with the Minister, particularly  those aggravated burglaries that lead to death. He asked the Minister whether  he would introduce the same tougher measures and laws on knife crime as the  Home Secretary has introduced. The Minister said that the Bill that is due to  come before the House will cover many of the issues that were raised by the PPS  and the recommendations on criminal justice.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Stephen Farry mentioned the level of crime in Northern Ireland,  and he talked about elderly people. He said that the PSNI had a major role to play  in the prevention and detection of crime. Those should be the two main  principles of any police service.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The fear among elderly people came through in the remarks  of the Chairperson of the Committee for Justice, Lord Morrow, who mentioned a  &ldquo;distraction burglary&rdquo;. Someone called at the home of an 80-year-old to say  that he or she wanted to carry out work around the house. During that time,  however, the house was burgled.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">He also said that there was a 236% increase in crime and a  54% increase in burglaries in Dungannon. That is high for that rural area. The  Minister referred to the number of robberies in the Dungannon area. He said  that they had increased from somewhere in the region of 14 to 36, or some  number around that; I did take a note of it. Sometimes, the actual numbers and  the percentages are completely different when they are looked at together.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Alex Maskey referred to the difficulties that are caused by  serious crime and the trauma felt by victims of crime. He mentioned the need to  get to grips with trends in local areas, and he suggested that the DPPs have an  active role to play in that. He also said that the Policing Board has initiated  a new objective to increase the number of crimes that are reported.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Alban Maginness mentioned the elderly as well, and he said  that there was a need to reduce crime. He mentioned the community policing  strategy, which is important to all of us.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Jim Shannon referred to the number of crimes in the  Strangford area, and to the elderly. He also mentioned the importance of crime  prevention.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister said that Northern   Ireland is a safe place and that there is less crime in Northern Ireland than in other parts of the United Kingdom.  The NISRA figures show that. He mentioned a number of programmes and answered a  substantial number of questions that were asked.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">This has been a good and sensible debate, and it shows that  crime affects all of our communities in the same way. We can sit in the House  and have proper debates about these issues, and I welcome the fact that that is  what we have done in this first justice debate. I recommend the motion and ask  the House for its unanimous support.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly condemns the spate of robberies within  local communities across Northern Ireland; and calls on the Minister of Justice  to produce a more effective strategy to protect citizens&rsquo; private property and  vulnerable people in our society.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Adjourned at 5.28 pm.</p>
