    <p class="H4StageHeading">Justice Bill: Second Stage</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice (Mr Ford)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That the Second Stage of the Justice Bill [NIA 1/10] be  agreed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I begin with an admission: I take some pleasure in standing  before the House as Minister of Justice for Northern Ireland and presenting to  the Northern Ireland Assembly the first Justice Bill to be considered in this  Chamber for almost 40 years. It is a matter not simply of personal pleasure but  pleasure on behalf of the Assembly and of all the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Today is a day of some significance. Following my formal  introduction of the Justice Bill on 18 October, today is, I hope that Members  will agree, a significant day for all of us. It is significant for the  devolution of policing and justice. Since 12 April, I have stressed that the  touchstone for the Department of Justice will be the creation of justice  legislation for Northern    Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly was given the powers to legislate on policing  and justice almost seven months ago. Within an even shorter period, we are  already considering legislation that will make major changes to the justice  system. That legislation and the wider work around it will lay a foundation  stone for future development. Collectively, we have taken major steps forward  since devolution on 12 April; we should all take credit for that. Today,  therefore, has significance for the Assembly, which is now delivering for the  people of Northern Ireland  justice powers that have been created specifically for our needs. Executive  Ministers have considered the Justice Bill in draft form, the Justice Committee  has been briefed on the proposals for the Bill and been involved in their  development, and from today the Assembly as a whole can play a part.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is also a day of significance for the justice system  itself. The Assembly will be considering legislation that will make significant  changes to the way that the justice system does its business. The legislation  will improve the services that we provide to victims and witnesses, enhance  community safety, better engage communities and allow us to do our business  better, more effectively and more efficiently in the current economic climate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It would be dishonest of me, however, not to register some  personal pleasure, too, in bringing justice legislation before the Assembly  today. It has significance for me and for my Department. On 12 April, as part  of the Hillsborough Castle Agreement, I was charged with bringing forward a justice  Bill for Northern Ireland.  In a little over six months, we have a major piece of legislation for Members&rsquo;  consideration. I pay tribute to those who helped along the way &mdash; to my staff on  policy matters, the draftsmen and the Committee that helped to shape the  legislation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The legislation was not created in isolation. It sits in a  wide programme for change that my team and I have been working vigorously to  deliver. It is part of a broad programme of work at many levels designed to  reshape Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  justice system and to deliver for the people of our region.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At the most strategic level, we have secured Executive and  Assembly agreement on an addendum to the Programme for Government to map out  the way forward for the Department. Wider afield, I have developed a close  working relationship with ministerial colleagues outside Northern Ireland:  the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Justice, the Scottish Cabinet  Secretary for Justice and the Irish Minister for Justice and Law Reform.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At the managerial and delivery level, the Department has  established a criminal justice delivery group, chaired by myself, which will  oversee the work of the Criminal Justice Board. It has overseen a new programme  of work, delivered through the Criminal Justice Board, to streamline processes  and eliminate wasteful delay in the criminal justice system. It has brought  forward reforms to the legal aid system, with the objective of aligning legal  aid expenditure with the available budget by 2012.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have also set in train a wide programme of change. I have  commissioned reviews and have launched key consultations. The reviews will  examine the conditions of detention management and oversight of all our  prisons; public legal services in Northern Ireland, to decide how best  to help people to secure access to justice; and the arrangements for police  injury-on-duty awards. Just yesterday, as the House will know, I announced a  major review of our youth justice system.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">For the Bill, there were, for example, consultations on legal  aid, community safety structures and funding for victims&rsquo; schemes. There is a consultation  on sentencing guidelines mechanisms to examine how best to establish a clearer,  transparent and more consistent framework for sentencing and a consultation on  a new code of practice for victims, with the intention of placing that code on  a statutory footing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill that has its Second Stage today sits squarely in  that reform agenda in our Programme for Government and is built on and delivers  key aspects of our strategic initiatives as part of our victims strategy,  community safety strategy, public protection and sexual offender management  agenda, our recently published strategy to manage women offenders, our work to  improve access to the justice system and, crucially, our planning policies for  Budget 2010. The Bill is a key part of our strategic reform and development  agenda. It undoubtedly reflects a need for change in our justice system and a  desire in the justice system to do its business better, deliver better and  enhanced services to victims and witnesses, improve public safety and build  stronger and safer communities, and reduce costs, particularly for legal aid.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Let me explain what the Bill seeks to achieve in broad  principles. It is designed to improve services and facilities for victims and  witnesses, to improve our community safety arrangements, to tackle problem  areas such as sports law and to improve provision to deal with offenders and,  at the same time, to allow the justice system to do its business better by  improving systems and reducing costs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Without going into too much detail, the Bill delivers on  those key principles across nine parts. I want to highlight a number of them.  Part 1 will improve services to victims through the creation of an offender levy  to make offenders more accountable for the harm that they cause by requiring  them to make a financial contribution towards support services for the victims  of crime. Whether offenders are in prison or in the community, a levy would be  imposed on them that would go directly to fund and extend victims&rsquo; services.  Part 1 also expands the services and protections given to vulnerable or  intimidated witnesses when they appear in court. Special measures are sometimes  required to provide extra protection or to help people who are vulnerable or  subject to intimidation to participate fully in court proceedings. The  provisions will increase the opportunities for help, which include video  evidence or allowing certain witnesses to have someone with them in support.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Part 2 deals with similar territory, in that it will allow  wider use of live link facilities in courts in the justice system for  vulnerable people and for the general improvement of live link availability.  Live links are facilities whereby defendants and witnesses can participate in  court proceedings by live video link, where appropriate. The Bill provides for  such links to be available between courts and psychiatric hospitals to ensure,  for example, that a mentally ill patient could be catered for without the  trauma or difficulty of travelling to a court.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Together, parts 1 and 2 are important features of a wider  programme of work to improve provision and services for the victims of crime  while allowing us to do our business better.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Part 3 restructures our community safety and district  policing partnerships, which are currently separate. The Bill integrates the  roles of both to create single partnerships for each district council. They are  to be known as policing and community safety partnerships, and they will  provide for a unified operational community safety and policing tier in each  council area, each with its own policing committee. As well as streamlining  administration, the new structures will improve public engagement, consultation  and delivery while maintaining the functions of the district policing  partnership. Part 3 is a key feature of our community safety and public  engagement work, and it will build confidence in the justice system more  effectively.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Part 4 will provide a major package to improve our laws on  sporting events. It is designed to address the worst incidents of misbehaviour  by so-called sports fans and to improve the enjoyment of those who wish to  attend sporting events without trouble. The package complements the Department  of Culture, Arts and Leisure&rsquo;s safety at sports grounds initiatives and  legislation, and it will tackle in-ground offences, such as offensive chanting.  It will also tackle the potential for trouble on the way to and from grounds  and the role of alcohol.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Part 5 improves a number of existing sentencing powers so  that particular offences and sentences can be dealt with. It largely concerns  violent offences, and it is designed to improve safety and tackle problems that  face communities. Sentencing for common assault, knife crime, sexual offences  and public protection is enhanced.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Parts 3, 4 and 5 are important aspects of our community  safety engagement and public protection strategies.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Part 6 will deliver alternative methods of prosecution by  increasing the opportunities for fixed penalty notices issued by police and  conditional cautions that could be imposed by either the police or a public  prosecutor. The sheer volume of minor offending, which largely refers to  disorder offences where guilty pleas are frequent and fines relatively low, can  clog up the court system. Under part 6, relevant offenders will be dealt with  quickly and effectively by police or prosecutors, and offenders will be able to  avoid the court process. The provisions in part 6 assist our efficiency and delay  programmes by way of powers that would free police time for front line policing  and allow courts extra time to concentrate on more serious cases.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Part 7 makes changes to our legal aid legislation. It  creates a power for a new means test for legal aid; it will allow legal aid  costs to be recovered from those who can afford them; and it will loosen some  of the restrictions on the Legal Services Commission to allow successful cases  to cover the costs of unsuccessful ones. Those powers are but one aspect of the  wider reform programme for legal aid services as we seek to stem and reduce the  apparently ever-increasing pot of money required. Not only will that be a key  feature of our Budget 2010 but, by targeting money at the most appropriate  cases, it will improve access to justice for those most in need.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Without diminishing their importance, parts 8 and 9 are  more miscellaneous and focus on very particular improvements to the court  system. They will adjust the court tiers at which bail cases can be dealt with,  revise membership of the rules committees and improve arrangements for  third-party witness summonses.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I should perhaps say a few words about the items that I had  wanted to legislate for but for which I could not find room. A major programme  of reform is under way in the Department of Justice, and there are so many  areas that could be tackled. The Bill cannot tackle everything, but it is  undoubtedly an important start. With 108 clauses and seven schedules, the Bill  is perhaps the largest that the Assembly has considered or will consider.  However, there simply was not enough room to cover everything.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">10.45 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I had hoped to introduce further system improvements by  reforming court boundaries to create a single territorial jurisdiction for  Magistrate&rsquo;s Courts and County Courts. That would have allowed court business  to be done more effectively. I had also hoped to create new powers for the  Public Prosecution Service, including powers for prosecutors to consider and  issue fines and summonses, again allowing for a more effective system for  courts and prosecutors.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">For various reasons that are largely technical or  operational, I also had to drop previous plans to legislate on the Upper  Tribunal&rsquo;s role in judicial review applications and to create a power of  inspection of property in criminal cases, as well as a proposal for certain  judicial salaries to be charged to the Consolidated Fund. There was not the  capacity to deal with some of those issues, which will have to be left for  another day.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Other matters got as far as the drafting of new provisions.  I consulted on matters and presented to the Committee areas in which I fully  intended to deliver change. Those areas include conferring the rights of  audience on solicitor advocates in the higher courts and changes to court funds  law to provide for the payment of certain fees from investment accounts in  specific circumstances, with the approval of the court. Those were ready for  inclusion in the Bill but were withdrawn at a late stage owing to issues over  legislative competence. Subject to those issues being resolved &mdash; my officials  are already working on doing so &mdash; I intend to seek to reintroduce the  provisions by way of amendment at an appropriate stage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In a similar vein, I needed to adjust the sports law  package quite late on, removing aspects of the football banning order procedure  and the restrictions on alcohol in private facilities at sports grounds. The  same was true of my plans to legislate for the improvement of cross-border sex  offender reporting. We needed to accommodate a recent court judgement in the  underpinning law, and, as it is a cross-jurisdictional issue, we are now  pursuing that with other jurisdictions. Again, if those sex offender and sports  law issues can be resolved, I hope to bring at least some of those features  back by way of amendment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One further matter is worth drawing to Members&rsquo; attention,  and this is the only time that I will refer to a specific clause in the Bill at  this stage. Clause 34, which is part of our community safety restructuring,  places a duty on public bodies to consider crime, antisocial behaviour and  community safety implications in exercising their duties. That duty is of  practical and strategic importance. At a practical level, it provides an  important base for the new policing and community safety partnerships. It  creates a statutory basis for co-operation that is much stronger than the  current voluntary arrangements. At a higher level, clause 34 has a strategic  and visible importance for the way in which we as a body of devolved Departments  now work together on shared concerns. Clause 34 has the principle of  partnership at its core as we face up to the challenges of how we can jointly  deal with crime, antisocial behaviour and community safety.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When I obtained Executive approval to introduce the Bill,  some Executive members discussed clause 34 and its implications for their  Department. They agreed to the inclusion of the clause, but with the caveat  that the position would be brought back to them after the Justice Committee&rsquo;s  consideration. The Committee wanted to give it further consideration to ensure  that any consequences of having a statutory duty were justified. I look forward  to hearing any views that may be expressed today on clause 34 and to the  Committee&rsquo;s views in particular during its scrutiny of the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will conclude by looking to the future, a future in which  the Bill sets out an important template for the justice system, for the  devolution of policing and justice powers, for the delivery of local democracy  and for our shared future. That future will see further changes to the justice  system and will result in the Assembly&rsquo;s continuing to consider and improve our  justice legislation. It will include a programme of tribunal reform in Northern Ireland;  a review of the accountability arrangements for the Public Prosecution Service;  a new offender management strategy; a comprehensive strategic framework for  reducing offending; further key and strategic consultation exercises on  alternatives to custody; and a new community safety strategy. Some of those issues  will be for the next justice Bill in the next Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Today, we have a Justice Bill before the House that makes  important changes to the way in which we deliver our justice system, seeks to  improve our community safety, and, perhaps most important of all, reminds us of  the importance of victims in the justice process. The Justice Bill is a  platform for the Assembly as a whole and is a major stepping stone in the  devolution of policing and justice powers. I commend the Justice Bill to the  House.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Justice (Lord Morrow)</strong>: We always seem to want to say,  as I have written in my notes, that the Justice Bill is the first of its kind  that the House or a local Administration has had either the audacity or,  indeed, the pleasure to debate. The Minister was at pains to make that point in  his statement. Therefore, I had better make it as well. That seems to be the  way to do it. Hence, I want to say that the Justice Bill is the first for some  40 years that any elected forum has had the pleasure to debate in the House.  That having been said, I want to move on quickly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill is important legislation that covers diverse and  wide-ranging issues. The Committee for Justice commends its main themes of  improving efficiency and effectiveness in the justice system; improving public  safety and building stronger and safer communities; and, as was mentioned  earlier, delivering better and enhanced services to victims and witnesses.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At the first meeting of the Committee for Justice in April  2010, it was advised of the Minister&rsquo;s intention to bring forward a Justice  Bill. Subsequently, during May and June 2010, the Committee received written  and oral briefings on the Bill&rsquo;s potential content and on a number of  departmental consultations on justice policies that were earmarked for  inclusion in the Bill. The Committee used those briefings to comment, raise  issues and make suggestions on a number of policy areas that the Minister of  Justice has taken into account in the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">More recently, on 18 October 2010, the Committee was  briefed by departmental officials on the contents of the Justice Bill and on  areas that are not included in the Bill but may be introduced through  amendments at a later stage. I will return to those issues later. I take this  opportunity to thank the Minister and his officials for their assistance to the  Committee throughout the pre-introductory stage of the process. I look forward  to continuing our good working relationship during Committee Stage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Today, the Assembly considers the principles of the Justice  Bill. The Bill, as introduced, is large, with 108 clauses and seven schedules.  As I indicated, the Committee for Justice supports the broad principles of the  Bill. However, concerns have been expressed that large parts of the Bill simply  reflect changes that have already been made to the criminal justice system in  other jurisdictions, particularly in England and Wales, and that an opportunity  to develop solutions that are tailored specifically to Northern Ireland has  been missed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will comment on each of main themes in turn as they are  presented in the Bill. Under the theme of providing better services for victims  and witnesses, the Bill provides for the creation of an offender levy; extends  a number of special measures for the giving of evidence by vulnerable and  intimidated witnesses; and extends the provision of live video links. The  Committee fully endorses proposals that put victims&rsquo; interests at the centre of  the justice system and will examine closely whether proposals in the Bill will  go some way to realising that ideal.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When the Committee scrutinises the Bill, it will look  closely at the practical administration of the offender levy, the costs  involved and the outworking of the proposed victims of crime fund. The  Committee will want to be assured that the levy revenue can be ring-fenced in  the way that is envisaged by the Department of Justice and that the programmes  that are financed by the funds generated through the levy will have real impact  and will be additional to current statutory provision.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One proposal for the funding is to enable the introduction  of independent sexual violence advisers who can travel through the justice  system with victims of rape or serious sexual offences. Recently, the Committee  received a briefing on the handling of sexual violence and abuse cases by the  criminal justice system. Given that we heard about the lack of service that is  provided to victims, we would all welcome such a development.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">During the policy briefing stage, the Committee raised concerns  with officials that the rate of the proposed levy at that time did not  necessarily reflect the seriousness of the offence that was committed. The  Committee is pleased to note that the Minister has taken on board the  Committee&rsquo;s concerns on that matter and that the Bill now includes provision  for a two-tiered levy rate to be applied to immediate custodial sentences in  recognition of the greater harm caused to victims by those who are convicted of  serious and violent crimes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the fact that the Bill will also formalise the  presence of a supporter in the live link room for vulnerable and intimidated  witnesses giving evidence.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In his proposals under the second theme of enhancing  community safety, the Minister has included provisions in the Bill to bring  together the functions of district policing partnerships and community  partnerships through the creation of new policing and community partnerships.  Provisions under that scheme also include new sports laws and adjustments to  existing sentencing powers. On the creation of new policing and community  safety partnerships, the Committee is aware that, although the consultation  responses received on the Department&rsquo;s policy proposals broadly supported the  principle of a single partnership, there was no consensus on the model to be  used. The Committee will want to consider in further detail the single model  being proposed and the accountability arrangements that it is likely to  deliver.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee has also received correspondence from  sporting organisations on the provisions in the Bill relating to the  introduction of a package of new sports and spectator laws. The Committee will  seek assurances that the provisions do not present a one-size-fits-all policy  and are targeted and proportionate to the problems that exist rather than being  legislation for legislation&rsquo;s sake. The Committee will also wish to explore the  practical outworkings of the provisions and how sectarianism can be  specifically covered in the clause on offensive chanting. Given the interests  of the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure in that area of the Bill, we  will seek the views of that Committee on those clauses.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On the third theme of improving access to justice through  system efficiency and effectiveness, the Bill provides for the introduction of  new and additional alternatives to prosecution, including an expanded fixed  penalty notice scheme and the use of conditional cautions. The Bill also  contains financial reforms on legal aid to allow for the introduction of means  testing, for example.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On the alternatives to prosecution provisions, the  Committee will want to ensure that the interests of victims remain to the fore.  The Committee will want to be assured that the new provisions represent a fair  and proportionate way of dealing with first-time and non-habitual offenders who  have committed relatively minor offences, while acting as a genuine and  effective disincentive to further reoffending. We will also wish to consider  whether the range of offences for which fixed penalties will be applied is  appropriate and whether those powers will make a significant impact in  unclogging the judicial system.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill also makes changes to legal aid legislation,  including a rule-making power for a new means test for the granting of criminal  legal aid. In considering the enabling power, the Committee must be satisfied  that there is no intention to set the means test at a level that would diminish  access to justice for those who need it most.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee will wish to consider carefully the content  of the Bill and explore further the reasons why issues regarding legislative  competence arose at a very late stage prior to the introduction of the Bill and  resulted in proposals that were expected to feature in the Bill not being  included. Those proposals include the conferring of rights of audience on  solicitor advocates in the higher courts and football banning orders for fans  travelling to matches outside Northern    Ireland. The Committee is aware that there  is disappointment in some quarters that those proposals are not in the Bill.  The Department has indicated that, if it can address concerns raised by the  Attorney General, it proposes to bring those provisions back as amendments at a  later stage in the Bill&rsquo;s progress.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee will wish to explore its position on those  issues, even though they are not part of the Bill as it stands. There may well  be other areas that the Committee may wish to see included in the Bill. The  Committee for Justice is seeking written evidence on the Bill from a wide range  of organisations and individuals, and we look forward to considering the views  expressed and exploring any issues raised during Committee Stage. The Committee  will report its findings to the Assembly in due course.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.00 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That is all that I want to say as Chairperson of the  Committee. However, I want to make a point or two as an MLA. I recently  listened to a radio programme on which an MLA talked about legislation; he  wondered where it was and what was happening to it. I would have thought that  that MLA would have known where it was. Anyway, it is a very simple exercise to  find out where a Bill is if one is in any doubt. That MLA is here with us  today, so I remind him that the Bill will now be referred to the Committee,  which will take control of it, and it will probably be with the Committee until  at least January or February of next year.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">For that Member&rsquo;s sake, I am telling him that that is where  the Bill will be. The next time that he is on &lsquo;The Stephen Nolan Show&rsquo;, he may  wish to make it clear that he knows where the Bill is, because he did not seem  to know where any Bills were. He thought that they might have got lost in the  maze. I assure him that the Bill will not get lost in the Committee, because we  will look after it and scrutinise it in great detail. It will be with us for a  considerable time. I hope that the Member takes note of that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Ar dt&uacute;s, ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilte a chur  roimh an Bhille at&aacute; os &aacute;r gcomhair ar maidin. Beidh Sinn F&eacute;in ag obair leis an  Aire, leis an Roinn agus leis an Choiste leis an Bhille a bhun&uacute;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Minister for his presentation. Sinn F&eacute;in  welcomes the Bill. When the Chairperson was speaking, I looked around the  Chamber to see whose feet were shuffling the most to see who the guilty person  was. Fortunately, they are all good poker players.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes the Second Stage of the Bill &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I wonder whether the Member feels that we should institute an inquiry to find  the guilty person. Perhaps Lord Morrow will tell us later.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  Perhaps. I hope that legal aid will be sorted out by that stage, so access will  not be denied. However, that is another issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in sees the Bill &mdash; the first piece of legislation  from the Department of Justice &mdash; as evidence of the need for and the delivery  of the transfer of policing and justice powers to the Assembly. The Bill is  evidence of the Assembly legislating for the people whom we represent. We  should shape it in such a way so that when it becomes law, it represents all  the people whom we represent.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill sits well alongside other initiatives of the  Department, such as the review of prisons and the review of the Youth Justice  Agency. Alongside the valuable work of the Criminal Justice Inspection, it has  allowed us, as MLAs and as members of the Committee, to look at the strengths  and weaknesses of the justice system so that, as we try to shape it, we find  out which areas need improvement and how we can build on its strengths.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We all accept that there was a limited window of  opportunity between now and the end of the mandate. However, the Bill, by the  extensive nature of what it covers, demonstrates that it was not the easy  option but that it is an extensive piece of work. As we take it through the  Committee, we will see the detail required to scrutinise it as we should. I  speak on behalf of Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n and John O&rsquo;Dowd when I say that we are  ready for that, as, I have no doubt, are the other members of the Committee.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister outlined in detail the principles of the Bill,  as did the Chairperson of the Committee, which is what this part of the process  is about. What we now need to do in the Committee is shape the legislation to  ensure that it covers and is representative of the needs and demands of the  people of the North. The Bill covers victims and witnesses, community safety  and system efficiency, and effectiveness. Those are three excellent recurrent  themes for the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have heard the Minister and the Chairperson of the  Committee outline sub-themes with regard to vulnerable and intimidated  witnesses; the offender levy; how community safety partnerships and the DPPs  could and should work better in future; and sports law. In times past, I sat on  the Culture, Arts and Leisure Committee, which discussed sports law. This  legislation is welcome because aspects of sports law need to be addressed. It  is, perhaps, not as big a problem here as elsewhere, but it is something that  we need to address. Alternatives to prosecution, based on fixed penalties, will  be welcomed by most people.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee received a number of presentations on the  legal aid system and was well informed as to the various views on how legal aid  should be administered. Coming out of this process, we should have a better  system. We have listened to the officials and to all the presentations and it  is important that access to justice remains a fundamental threshold in which we  examine all that we do. We cannot have a system that, in some ways, denies  access to justice. Our justice system should be designed and have at its core a  sense that we have a good justice system that is accessible, represents all  people equally and has no hidden spots.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Initially, when going through the process in Committee,  Sinn F&eacute;in raised some concerns about the screening out of some aspects of the  Bill, but we are reassured that the EQIA will examine the process to ensure  that section 75 issues will be covered at the conclusion of our work. We are  committed to the programme of work that the Chairperson has outlined, and we  will come at this matter with a view to ensuring that the Bill is in the best  interests of the justice system and the people we represent. Go raibh maith  agat.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  In general, the Ulster Unionists welcome the Minister&rsquo;s initiative in laying  the Bill before the House. However, there are issues that we wish to detail and  matters that have arisen on which we seek clarification.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I understand that the revenue gained from the offender levy  is to be used solely for the victims of crime fund. Before I address the  benefits and distribution of the fund, let me say that when the Ulster  Unionists met the Minister on 12 August, we were informed that the levy was not  intended to replace existing services for victims, but would complement them. I  should be grateful if the Minister were to confirm that that is the case.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">With respect to the extraction of payments, it is clear  that payment of compensation orders will take priority over the levy, although  the levy, in turn, will be collected before a fine or court costs. In clause 1,  the levy can be reduced even to nil if an offender is judged to have  insufficient means to pay. Clause 3 states that the governor is empowered to  deduct money from a prisoner or young offender in order to meet the value of a  fine imposed by the courts. However, in clause 4, it is stated that the court  cannot set a default period of imprisonment for non-payment of the offender  levy. Therefore, there is no punishment by imprisonment for not paying the levy,  but if an offender defaults on a fine or is imprisoned or given a community  service sentence, the court can remit a part of the offender levy that is yet  to be paid.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I ask the Minister to clarify when an offender will be  informed that he or she is liable to pay the levy, and, equally important, when  a victim will be made aware of an offender paying the levy. Will a victim be  told of the sum of money deducted and to be contributed to the victims of crime  fund? Does it mean, therefore, that where an offender defaults on a fine and is  imprisoned, and a court remits a part of the levy yet to be paid, that such a  fine could end up being paid for an offender by the victims of crime fund?  Surely that could not happen. The victims, the important people, will want  reassurances. After all, we are all potential victims, and the public interest  in this aspect of the Bill is extremely high.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If an offender has paid the levy, will it be set against  the actual sentence laid down by the court, or will it be set against what  appears to be the normal adjustment of time served, which is shorter? If that  is the case, will any outstanding levy amount be discharged by an offender in  time for his release from prison or detention?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I can see the Minister&rsquo;s good intentions in the levy,  and as I can see it going some way to give satisfaction to a victim, I want to  help the Minister to establish it, but as an extra bounce to a punishment that  could make an offender think twice about offending again. Moreover, it may make  an offender think about his unfortunate victim, because it must be remembered,  and this is the rub for most victims, that although the extra bounce is  something that we would all like to see, it is not apparent.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The victims of crime fund will not gain extra money. It will  simply move money from one pot to another or from one type of fine to another.  If that is the case, the Minister needs to do something more convincing on the  following: he must demonstrate that the levy imposed is not only proportionate  to the level of offence committed, but that those convicted of serious  offences, and who arguably cause the greatest harm to their victims, contribute  a greater sum to the fund through the levy; he must ensure that the  justification of an offenders&rsquo; levy is not used to weaken or to reduce the  impact of a punishment because it would rank below a compensation order; and he  must ensure that, where the proposals are to have small, weekly deductions from  prison earnings, those deductions will be made and will be paid towards the  levy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not want that to be seized upon by the liberal loveys  with whom the Minister has been known to fraternise in the past. They will want  to know whether he is seeking to punish prisoners even more, or even punish  them too much, which is what I hear from the walls outside: poor old prisoners,  indeed. It is the poor and often damaged victims whom we should be thinking of,  many of whom are and will remain vulnerable, such as the elderly and the  law-abiding people. Many of them will wonder why, and will be outraged to know,  perhaps, that when people receive custodial sentences, not only are they well  fed, kept fit, ensured of recreation time and the freedom to watch TV or to  catch up on a hobby, but they are actually paid for being in prison. The money  going into the victims&rsquo; of crime fund is deducted from weekly prison earnings.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Perhaps the Bill might also consider how victims feel about  people who battered them, turned their home upside down and hospitalised them.  They will want to know why those people are apparently entitled to prison  earnings.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My colleagues will deal with other aspects of the Bill. No  doubt when it comes before the Committee, more points of clarification will  arise.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Part 4 of the Bill deals with sport. It seems very unfair  on soccer. I want the Minister to justify why that is the case. He needs to be  more open and transparent in admitting to whom the subtext refers. Clearly, the  emphasis in regulated matches is on soccer.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Last year, in a report by Millward Brown on international  soccer, 80% of those questioned agreed that the IFA works for all sides of the  community; 78% thought that the IFA had worked hard to move football forward  over the past four years; 76% agreed that Northern Ireland games had become  family friendly; 73% said that the Northern Ireland team is representative of  the whole community; and 86% said that the IFA had eradicated sectarianism over  the past four years.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">With all the superb efforts that have been made by all  sports to tidy up and to remove images that no one could be proud of or find  acceptable, I find the pitch of this part of the legislation against soccer to  be offensive. Soccer is the only sport that is being picked on unfairly. It deserves  to be given a better press or presentation than would seem to be the case in  the proposed legislation. To that end, the Minister should reflect on the  singling out of soccer and come back to the House with a more appropriate draft  that is less damaging to soccer.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.15 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I believe that ordinary, decent soccer fans will recoil  from the typecast that is being created, which paints a wrong picture that  soccer fans, more than any others, are a bunch of drunken hooligans. Any groups  of people who are overladen with too much alcohol are likely to let the drink  turn them into drunken dopes. I fully appreciate that, on the other hand, the  provisions that are outlined in the Bill are to fill gaps in the law in respect  of existing criminal law and legislation that covers antisocial behaviour and  alcohol abuse. I acknowledge that the Bill will be seen as supplementary to the  controls that are exercised by organisers of sporting events. I recognise the  intended effort that is being co-ordinated to improve the level of sports  spectators. However, it is admitted in the Bill that there appears to be  difficulty in defining a drunk. It seems to be categorically problematic, which  begs the question: if the legislation is introduced, just who will decide  whether an individual is drunk?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A similar difficulty arises with chanting. There is no  definition of &ldquo;indecent&rdquo;, and there is even less sure ground regarding  sectarianism, which is now deemed to be found somewhere loosely under the  description of offensive. I think that a variety of events organisers, from  reading the Bill, will have noticed the inability to specifically identify a  prescriptive offence for being drunk or chanting sectarian abuse. That is a  type of person whom we see too often in public, but I am glad to say that it is  not frequently attributed to today&rsquo;s typical football or soccer supporter or  any other supporter going to a sporting event. It would be helpful if the  Minister would detail how clause 38 on chanting and clause 41 on being drunk at  a regulated match would be enforced.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Continuing with sport, I will now pursue a further number  of points for the Minister to consider. Most clubs supplement their incomes by  selling alcohol at their grounds. A case can be made that, under supervision of  the clubs, overindulgence by a fan can be controlled. However, the provisions  in clauses 42 and 43 introduce the ability to encourage potential spectators  away from the clubs and to attend local bars, where the control of consumption  may not always be provided, on the way to a match. Indeed, that would cause a  loss of income for the local club facility, added to which an increased number  at local bars may create trouble in the form of unruly behaviour kicking off,  so to speak, before or on the way to a match. Will the Minister clarify whether  alcohol could be served inside grounds, and, if so, by whom? How will clauses  42 and 43 be enforced? How does he propose to change the law on alcohol on the  terraces? Will he reverse that for soccer matches or will he introduce it for  other sports matches?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 45 concerns ticket touting. Why is the provision  applicable only to soccer matches? Does ticket touting not take place at  popular or sell-out rugby or GAA games? Will the Minister explain his thinking  on that clause? Does it further illustrate that he, his officials and the  draftsmen see the soccer fan as different to other sports fans? I understand,  as I am sure do most Members, that, in most cases, Irish league soccer games  are not ticketed. Perhaps that reflects the numbers involved and the good sense  of the fans in as much as touting is not a particular problem. Therefore, why  is the Department on record as stating that the reason for the provision is to  keep supporters segregated?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If a social aspect is part of soccer fans&rsquo; views of going  to a match &mdash; I think that it is; it is part of their day &mdash; they would need to  be champion hurdle jockeys to jump the obstacles placed before them. They  appear to be picked on as the most likely to get drunk, brawl, chant  obscenities and fall for ticket touting. To cap it all, so bad is their behaviour  that they must be kept segregated from each other. There we have it. At a time  when integration is under particular popular scrutiny, when the debate is being  forced in another direction by the First Minister, and when rewards are being  offered to improve and enhance integration, clause 45 tells us that soccer fans  should be segregated.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Dare I move on to banning orders? That provision &mdash; yes,  Members have guessed; they have worked it out &mdash; will apply only to football  matches. Why again single out soccer unfairly? Hopefully, the Minister will  enlighten us as to how banning orders will be enforced. How will stadium  officials know that an individual is banned? Will a culprit&rsquo;s photograph be  circulated to all grounds and pinned up at the entrance gate for the officials  who will search for the banned person? Will banned people be excluded from all  football matches, including ones held outside Northern Ireland? Furthermore, will  it be the job of the PSNI to administer and to enforce those orders? That is  not clear.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I know that, as we have asked, the Minister will reflect  seriously on the part of the Bill that covers sport. In obliging, he may  meditate on the constructive thrust of the manner in which I have raised issues  and ask himself specifically what problems are solved by the Bill&rsquo;s provisions  on sport. Will he consider fully the undertones of allegations that the sports  provisions are a form of elitism, to the extent that, in citing and  highlighting soccer in an over-the-top fashion, the Department cannot escape  responding to the charge in the sports consultation paper that Protestant  working-class males will be unfairly impacted?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, I turn to the part of the Bill that has so  endeared the Minister to those who practise law, namely the provisions on legal  aid. I agree that the present legal aid system is not sustainable. That may  have little to do with spending reviews or the Chancellor&rsquo;s Budget, although  the savings, if made, will help to lower costs. I question how anyone can argue  for the continuation of a system that is given a budget of &pound;85 million but,  seemingly, is allowed to get away with spending more than &pound;104 million. Is it  the case that lawyers have turned legal aid into their own form of quantitative  easing? Was it the case that, under direct rule, the Northern Ireland Office  was happy to let lawyers spend taxpayers&rsquo; money without keeping an active watch  on any overspend?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am a little wary of upsetting any exponents of the noble  profession. One never knows when one or two of them might come in handy. One of  these days, I may need one in my office. I hope not, but, if the fee is  acceptable, I suppose that any offence caused might be offset by the ability to  pay up on time, because that is what it is about. It is unfortunate, therefore,  that legal fees in general, across the convoluted board, are not under scrutiny  today or, for that matter, on any other day. If they were, I suspect that those  fine artisans of advocacy would kick up one hell of a fuss compared with the  one that they raised about legal aid costs being reduced. After all, if some of  them can live off legal aid to the tune of around &pound;1 million a year, think how  much others can earn without even having to tap into little old legal aid  cases. That may be why, when they see the paltry pay that we get for making  ourselves accountable for introducing legislation, which they will pick over  much later in the courts, with a few notable exceptions, so few members of the  profession are attracted to local politics.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Unless the Minister makes some changes to the Bill, by the  time that he has finished, the average soccer supporter whom I mentioned may  not be able to access legal aid. I am particularly interested to hear more from  him about the relationship between access to legal aid and the financial capability  of victims of domestic violence to pursue a non-molestation order. As with all  issues in the legal aid part of the Bill, the issue is complex. Nevertheless,  perhaps the Minister will touch on that matter and the other matters that I  mentioned.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I shall return to most of the following matters in  Committee. However, I shall take this opportunity to ask the Minister to  address clause 85, which makes provision for a means test to grant criminal  legal aid to sit alongside the merit test. To what extent will the means test  reduce legal aid costs by decreasing the number of defendants eligible for  criminal legal aid? Will the Minister give as accurately costed figures as  possible for the claim that is made in the explanatory and financial  memorandum? Furthermore, will he give his opinion on whether the more stringent  means test will make access to justice more difficult for more people, or is  that really the point that he wants to make? In clause 86, titled &ldquo;Order to  recover costs of legal aid&rdquo;, recovery of defence costs orders (RDCOs) were  initially to apply only to the Crown Court. Is it anticipated that the measure  will be rolled out to the Court of Appeal?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill will also lift the restriction on the Northern  Ireland Legal Services Commission, which is a quango that funds services under  a litigation funding agreement. On the face of it, that seems to be a positive  way in which to harness the revenue gained and to use it properly. However, is  the very nature of allowing litigants to pursue money damages, including for  personal injury litigation, on the basis that they would not be liable for  their legal costs if they are unsuccessful, contrary to current discussions in  England, and &mdash; I do not know whether it is &mdash; is it open to the reverse outcome  and to fees being hiked when cases are successful?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A high degree of responsibility for the Bill and its  passing into law rests on the Minister&rsquo;s shoulders. It is a credit to him,  therefore, that he has shown boldness in the pursuit of delivery, and less  arrogance than others whom I could name in mastering the presentation and  bringing of the Bill to the House, both of which are crucial and complex  endeavours. My colleagues will raise issues of undoubted concern, and I will  listen intently to the Minister&rsquo;s responses to them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">However, subject to what he has to say and to  further probing at Committee Stage, the Ulster Unionists are content to allow  the Minister the space and their full support to develop the Bill. We wish him  well in that transfer.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.30 am</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  The Minister of Justice and the Chairperson of the Justice Committee have  reminded us that this is the first local Justice Bill in 40 years. It is timely  to remember that. Of course, it is cited as a step in the right direction and  as progress in relation to devolution, and I recognise that. However, I remind  Members of the unhappy record of our predecessor institution, the Stormont  Parliament, and its passage of justice-related legislation such as the Special  Powers Act and the Public Order Act, which are rather unhappy precedents. I  hope that this institution will adopt a progressive approach based on human  rights, fairness and on trying to achieve justice for all in the community. We  have started that process with the introduction of the Justice Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It has to be said, however, that the Bill was effectively  mandated by the Hillsborough agreement. The Minister himself said that the Bill  was brought about by that agreement and was agreed on at those political  negotiations. The Bill&rsquo;s provisions are diverse and disparate, and it has  effectively been tacked together. It is not, in any sense, an elegant piece of  legislation. It puts a number of different issues into one Bill and attempts to  tackle them. However, that is not to say that it does not contain good  provisions; it clearly does. I hope that, in the coming months, the Assembly  and, in particular, the Justice Committee can refine and perfect those  provisions. It is important that we do our work diligently and conscientiously  and try to get the best out of the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill is also memorable in what it ignores. It is  necessary to highlight a number of outstanding issues in that regard. The  Minister has mentioned one, which is the relationship between the PPS and the  Assembly. Quite clearly, that relationship is inadequate, to put it mildly.  There is a lack of accountability, which is something that I, as SDLP justice  spokesman, have highlighted over the past number of months. We need to address  that issue. We cannot simply have an institution that is entirely autonomous  and over which we, as the democratic forum for the people of this region, have  no influence or say. It is essential that we look at that relationship. If we  do not do that, we will let down the public in Northern Ireland. That requires a  review, and I know that, in his address this morning, the Minister said that he  is aware of that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are also ignoring the whole area of sentencing. The Bill  does not address sentencing in any concerted fashion, although it does so  peripherally. I know that there are plans to introduce and to have consultation  on a sentencing council. However, that issue is very alive amongst the public.  If people talk to me about one issue, it is sentencing. It is important that  we, as legislators, get a handle on that, and it is essential that, as a  legislature, the Assembly gets it right. Sentencing is not included in the Bill  in any serious sense.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, we are ignoring the bizarre position in which  only the PPS can refer lenient sentences to the Court of Appeal. Previously,  the Attorney General could do so. However, our Attorney General cannot do that.  The PPS and the Director of Public Prosecutions can do that. However, the  Director of Public Prosecutions and the Office of Public Prosecutions are, in a  sense, a judge in their own cause because they are intimately involved in the  whole court process and are, therefore, involved to some extent &mdash; albeit  peripherally in some cases &mdash; in the sentence produced. Therefore, the law is  demanding that the PPS reviews an alleged lenient case and attempts to  determine whether it is an issue for the Court of Appeal. That is a bizarre  position in Northern Ireland  that needs to be examined very carefully. However, such a provision does not  appear in the Bill, and it is important to address that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We need to look specifically at a number of provisions in  the Bill in the next number of months. There has been much mention of the  offender levy. It is a good idea, and I do not think that anybody in the  Chamber will be opposed to it. However, from my limited experience of criminal  courts, I wonder whether many defendants are capable of paying an additional  amount, over and above, for example, a compensation order or a substantial  fine. In some cases, a person may be able to afford to do so, but I am not  absolutely convinced that that is the right way to proceed. The intention,  namely to contribute to ameliorating victims&rsquo; positions, is good. It is an  important principle, but we must look at it in more detail as time goes by.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill contains provisions to improve the legislation to  assist vulnerable and intimidated witnesses by way of special measures to  enable them to give their best possible evidence in criminal proceedings.  Again, that is welcome. However, we have to look at the detail. For example,  there is provision for automatic entitlement for adult complainants of sexual offences  to give video-recorded evidence in chief. It may well be that, in certain  circumstances, that entitlement should not be automatic. There should be the power  to do that but making that automatic is a measure that we would have to look at  seriously.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We need to look again at the provision for the  formalisation of the presence of a supporter in the live link room when a  witness is giving evidence. In principle, having a supporter in the link room  is a good idea, but could that person influence the way in which a witness  presents his or her evidence? Would that be a good influence or a bad  influence, and would it enhance or embellish a person&rsquo;s evidence? That is a  critical issue when we examine that provision. In the main, people will say  that it is a good idea because a vulnerable witness needs to be given some  support. However, one also needs to be cognisant of the effect that it could have  on the way in which the evidence is given and on the substance of the evidence  that is given.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One has to welcome the relaxation of restrictions on  witnesses giving additional evidence in chief after their video-recorded  statement has been admitted and the provision to allow intermediaries to be  made available to vulnerable defendants. All those measures are to be welcomed.  The provisions on live links are sensible and progressive. We have to look at  the details and be absolutely confident that we are not causing any form of injustice  to people by, perhaps, overemphasising live links.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My colleague Dominic Bradley will address the House on  policing and community safety partnerships, and I will make one general point  on that. We agree with the fusion of the partnerships and believe that there is  a synergy between the two; it is important that that be institutionalised. At  the same time, we are firmly committed to the Patten reforms, and any changes  must reflect Patten&rsquo;s original provisions on DPPs. We will defend that position  robustly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McNarry made a number of points on the provisions that  the Minister outlined on sports law. I do not share his misgivings about  soccer, and I do not think that the provisions pick on it unduly.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Humphrey</strong>:  Northern Ireland  football supporters have been in contact with my office to express their  concern about the Bill on the point that Mr McNarry made. The House should  remember that Northern Ireland  football supporters are effectively recognised by UEFA as the best supporters  in Europe.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I am heartened by the Member&rsquo;s last remark. In due course, I presume that the  Committee for Justice will hear from the supporters or their representatives. I  fail to see that soccer supporters are being picked on unduly as a result of  the provisions in the Bill. I am open to persuasion, as I am on many other  occasions, and I will consider very carefully anything that is said on soccer.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the main, it is important that there be civilised  standards at sporting events. The Bill&rsquo;s provisions will enhance behaviour at  those events, and everyone in the House should welcome that.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.45 am</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way. I ask him to turn to an issue that I have  noticed with clause 37, which deals with conduct at regulated matches. Under  the clause, it is an offence to throw anything at, towards or adjacent to the  playing area at any time during the period of a regulated match. Does the  Member agree that it might be a good idea for the Committee to look at the  wording of that clause, given that, for example, a malevolent or malicious  complaint might be levied against someone who throws a ball back into play? The  clause as currently worded means that some benign act that was not aimed at  injuring any spectator or participant may be construed by a malevolent person  as an act of aggression or of intended harm.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  The Member makes a reasonable point. On the face of it, someone who is  returning a ball from the terraces might be deemed to be committing an offence.  However, in practice, I doubt very much that &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I wish to clear up this point, which has already been raised in a  question that I answered. If Members look further down the clause, they will  see that it is an offence to throw anything at or towards the playing area:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;without lawful authority or lawful excuse&rdquo; .</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">As a general rule, returning a ball to play will be  regarded as lawful excuse.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I am very happy to accept the Minister&rsquo;s reassurance on that. Nonetheless, Mr  Campbell raised an interesting point. Part and parcel of our function here is  to scrutinise legislation, and I am sure that we will proceed in that fashion  at Committee Stage under the stalwart chairmanship of Lord Morrow. We have a  lot of work ahead of us in the coming months on the issue of sport and on other  aspects of the Bill. The whole issue of sectarianism in sport in Northern Ireland  needs to be addressed, and the Bill does that to some extent. However, perhaps  we can enhance those provisions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill has some useful provisions on the treatment of  offenders. In particular, it makes provision for increasing the maximum period  of sentence deferment to 12 months. That will help judges to deal with cases  where they want to test how an individual behaves, because they will be able to  extend the period of time that that person is effectively put on good behaviour  to either six months or one year. There are a number of issues relating to  that, but I will not go into those now.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Another useful part of the Bill is the alternatives to prosecution,  which includes new diversionary disposals and wider powers for fixed penalty  notices. That is important, because many minor offences clog up the court  system, and one way of alleviating that blockage and of dealing quickly and  effectively with people is by way of a fine or monetary penalty. In response to  a question asked at Committee, an official indicated that people who have to  pay such fixed penalty notices will not be deemed to have committed a criminal  offence. That is important, because if somebody does something that is  uncharacteristic, and it is their first offence, they should be given a certain  latitude.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A monetary penalty, by way of a fixed notice, is sufficient  for dealing with those people without staining their characters for the rest of  their lives. There is a benefit in fixed penalty notices, and the provision is  something that we will have to look at in detail. However, such notices are a  very helpful innovation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Conditional cautions, which the prosecution can bring  about, are also helpful and would avoid clogging up the courts system with  relatively minor offences.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that means testing for legal aid grants be  properly introduced. The detail remains to be worked out, and I hope that we  can have an input on it. I welcome means testing, which is long overdue. Also  long overdue is the provision for a separate enabling power to allow the courts  greater power to recover costs from legal aid defendants who are convicted. It  is important that those who have the where&shy;withal to pay for their legal  defence make a contribution or pay all their legal aid bill if the court  determines that they are in a position to do so. It is quite unjust for the  public to carry the burden of providing legal aid.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">An important innovation that is to be welcomed is the  removal of the restriction on the Northern Ireland Legal Services Commission  from establishing or funding services under litigation funding agreements.  However, I would like to see the details of how that would be worked out. In  the main, the Law Society and the Bar, of which I am a member &mdash; perhaps I  should declare an interest at this point &mdash; support the provision. We should be  working towards the creation of a civil legal aid organisation or  administration that can pay for itself and not be a burden on taxpayers in Northern Ireland.  I welcome the provision and hope that there can be creative thinking around it.  However, I warn the House that, in England, success fees, which are a  consequence of such an arrangement, have been strongly criticised by many  people. We should learn from the English experience that success fees can  become burdensome and make legal proceedings very expensive. We have to look at  that provision carefully.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, we welcome the Bill and most of its  provisions and will vigorously scrutinise it. The Bill is progress, and I thank  the Minister for introducing it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Before I call Dr Stephen Farry, I ask all Members to check that their mobile  phones are switched off. A mobile phone, or phones, is causing a major problem  to the amplifying system in the Chamber. If Members cannot switch their phones  off, can they please put them on silent? As I said, a mobile phone is having a  serious effect on the amplifying system.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: It  will come as no surprise that I, too, warmly welcome the Bill. The Assembly has  been looking forward to this legislation for quite some time. I will resist the  temptation to make the point that has already been made by others that this is  the first Justice Bill in 40 years. However, I think that I have done so  anyway, albeit indirectly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The more significant point is that, in addition to the good  work that the Department is doing, it is important that the Assembly is seen to  be taking ownership of justice. In considering, and hopefully passing,  significant justice legislation, it is important that we are seen to  copper-fasten the process of the devolution of policing and justice. This is  yet another landmark in that respect. If we can send out a strong message to  the wider public that the Assembly is taking justice matters seriously and is  doing hard work that will make a real difference to people, we will enhance its  credibility.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to address some themes that have not yet been  addressed directly in the Chamber, but which have been touched on in other  discussions about the Bill. The first point is that the Bill is simply a  rolling forward of the work that was commenced by the Northern Ireland Office.  It is important to stress that there were a lot of discussions prior to  devolution. Alban Maginness referred to the Hillsborough Agreement. That was  not imposed on the politicians of Northern Ireland; it was very much  written by locally elected politicians. All the parties were at Hillsborough Castle during the negotiations,  although, before Mr Kennedy intervenes, I will say that some were slightly more  involved than others and were present for slightly longer than others. However,  we shall not go back on history too much. Suffice it to say that that process,  in which the parties decided what policies they wanted to see, reflected  discussions that had already taken place, and the Alliance Party was extremely  vocal beforehand in trying to articulate what was important in taking  devolution forward. I have no doubt that, in the dying days of direct rule over  justice, the NIO reflected on where it felt that the political parties in Northern Ireland  wanted to take some of the important issues that needed legislative attention.  However, beyond that, it is important to stress that important modifications to  some of the different aspects of the Bill have been made since the NIO carried  out public consultations on them. Therefore, in that respect, the Bill is very  much made in Northern    Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The point was also made that the Bill is simply a  replication of legislation in England  and Wales,  albeit with certain time differences. In some respects, that accusation could be  made across the board as regards how the Assembly legislates; it does not just  apply to justice. However, it is important to stress that that claim is grossly  exaggerated. In practice, there are a lot of solutions tailored to meet the  needs of Northern Ireland.  I will come to some of those later on in my contribution, but, initially, I  want to draw attention to the alternatives for prosecution and, in particular,  the establishment of policing and community safety partnerships. Those  partnerships are very much bespoke and tailored to our particular local  circumstances. No doubt that approach will be reflected when the eventual  direction of legal aid is decided on.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Alban Maginness also referred to a number of items that are  not in the Bill, but it is important to stress that a Minister can only bring  substantive matters to the Assembly if a public consultation has been carried  out. All the items in the Bill have been through public consultation in recent  times. Items cannot simply be dropped in. In particular, the issue of  sentencing is out for public consultation. The Minister regards it as a very  important priority, and I have no doubt that he will look to legislate in that  area as soon as possible, based on the results of the consultation. It cannot  simply be dropped in without us having gone through the consultation process of  listening to the views of the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Another issue that requires a much wider debate is the role  of the PPS and its accountability. I do not necessarily disagree that there is  a problem with accountability in relation to resourcing and, at a general  level, the policy and practices that the PPS wishes to pursue. However, it is  important to stress that it goes without question that the operational  independence of the PPS over individual prosecutorial decisions must always be  protected. That is an important safeguard in any democratic society or in any  society that is based on the rule of law.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.00 noon</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My final general point is that this is a very lengthy piece  of legislation. It is commendable that we are able to work on it. There is a  lot of work to be done to scrutinise the Bill over the next number of months. I  recognise the commitment of the Chairperson of the Committee for Justice, and I  have no doubt that that Committee will give the Bill proper and due regard in  an efficient and effective manner. Legislation of this size and complexity will  inevitably be amended as it proceeds. I would be stunned if, come Consideration  Stage or Final Stage in February or March, we are here discussing a Bill that  is word for word what we have today. The legislative process involves bringing  on board the views of other Members and, in particular, the Committee. It  involves the Department and the Committee having discussions and, hopefully,  making agreed and consensual changes based on those discussions. We look  forward to the outworking of a process that is perfectly natural for any  democratic institution.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to highlight a number of important principles that  guide the legislation. First of all, there is a focus on the individual and on  how we handle each person. Those individuals can be victims of crime, witnesses  to crime or, indeed, perpetrators of crime. There is also a focus on enhanced  community safety and reducing crime. Ultimately, the Assembly&rsquo;s success or  failure in dealing with criminal justice must be judged by how people feel in  the community and whether they feel secure at home and on the streets. We also  hope to facilitate a reduction in offending and reoffending. The Bill will aid  the process of shifting the balance towards prevention and early intervention,  which we have talked about a lot in respect of not just criminal justice but  policy right across the board.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill not only provides for the appropriate punishment  of offenders but guides their rehabilitation. I will address that point in a  bit more detail when I speak about the offender levy because there are  different views on that in the House. The Bill also places a focus on the  importance of local and community solutions and the involvement of different  partners. It recognises that solutions to criminal justice matters are not  simply a matter for the Department and that solutions cut across all levels,  Departments and agencies of government. The proposals will also contribute to  and reinforce developments towards a shared future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I turn now to some specific aspects of the Bill. Members  will be pleased to note that I will not go through all nine parts; the  Committee will no doubt do that for us. The offender levy is win-win in many  respects. It is clearly seen primarily as something that will assist victims.  It is important to stress that that assistance will be additional to the  resources that will be available to support those who have suffered at the hands  of offenders. It is also a source of assistance for offenders in the process of  rehabilitation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a notion about an emerging split between people  who want to be hard on criminals and others who are perceived as soft on  criminals. There is also a notion about whether the focus should be on  punishment or rehabilitation. I stand here as a liberal, although certainly not  a liberal luvvy. The Minister is a liberal and has never been anything else.  The ultimate guide should be what works and what delivers enhanced community  protection and safety and a greater reduction in offending. As the Minister has  stressed on many occasions, we do not send people to prison for punishment;  they go there as punishment. What happens in prisons is critical to community  safety after offenders have been released. Virtually every person who goes to  prison will be released one day. What happens at that stage is important. There  is clear evidence that there is a problem with reoffending; there are very high  levels of reoffending in Northern Ireland. In many respects, what happens in  the prison setting can have as much influence on reducing crime and the  perceptions and outcomes of community safety as the work of police officers on  patrol, partnership working and other preventative work. Therefore, what  happens in the prison system is critical to the wider system.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not see prisons as being at the end of the spectrum of  criminal justice; they are part of a virtuous circle in trying to rehabilitate  offenders. This process is not about being nice to or soft on criminals. Going  to prison and losing liberty is a serious sanction. What happens in prison,  through rehabilitation, is important for everyone in this Chamber and wider  society.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The proposed offender levy will bring home to people the  reality of their offences and will teach them some responsibility through money  being deducted from earnings. That is a way of trying to normalise behaviour.  NGOs in the criminal justice field will recognise the process that I described.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that alternatives to prosecution are taken  forward. They are viewed as being appropriate for certain levels and kinds of  offending. Their benefits will include a reduction in costs, and they will help  to unclog a very bureaucratic justice system in which the progression of cases  is very slow, which is detrimental to victims and witnesses. Indeed, it is  detrimental to perpetrators, when it comes to getting them sentenced quickly  and starting the process of rehabilitation. In that sense, the proposals will  be much more efficient and effective when dealing with a certain kind of  offending, and they should not be viewed as being soft in any shape or form.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Alternatives to prosecution will have the added benefit of  freeing up police resources, and we are all very aware of the pressures that  they are under, particularly in light of the growing threat from dissident  republicans. It is incumbent on us to make the lives of the police as easy as  possible when dealing with the bureaucracy of the criminal justice system. The  police should be allowed to deal with what the public regard as the most  important issue: keeping us all safe. I know that the police support such  measures; indeed, they would probably urge the Department to go even further in  some respects. However, for good reason, at this stage, the Department has  proceeded with only two options for alternatives to prosecution. It is worth  noting, though, that there is a larger spectrum of what can be done. The  Assembly may wish to return to the other options at some stage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is an important issue about the interface between the  police and the Public Prosecution Service and about where discretion should lie  when making almost routine decisions about low-level offending. There should be  scope for a greater role for the police on that issue. The Public Prosecution  Service may have been set up for good reasons under the criminal justice review  of 2000, but, as time passes, it is important that we keep the balances that we  have struck under review and adjust them accordingly in light of changing  circumstances.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The next item that I want to focus on is policing and  community safety partnerships. Again, I stress that they are not simply a  rationalisation of DPPs and CSPs in addressing duplication and trying to find  cost savings. However, that is undoubtedly an important element and  consideration in what we do. Again, that reflects the wider reform agenda that  a number of parties in the Chamber are talking about. The focus should not just  be on cost; it should be much broader. The issue is to find a solution that is  greater than the sum of its parts and enhances community focus to deliver  outcomes in community safety. It is important that we take on board experience  in other jurisdictions where that model has been beneficial. In particular, we  should note the importance of senior partners coming to the table with greater  standing and how that helps the organisation to deliver results. We should also  note the importance of the duties placed on the statutory partners for crime  reduction and community safety.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is also worth nothing that the new model could fit  neatly with a future return to the review of public administration,  particularly with the new responsibility for community planning being given to  councils as part of that. The model for community safety in the Bill will sit  well with the wider responsibilities for community planning that will hopefully  be given to councils in the near future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">While we discuss a new strategy for cohesion, sharing and  integration, including responsibilities for good relations among councils, the  new policing and community safety partnerships will have an important interface  with good relations, because, as we all recognise, divisions in our society and  a lack of good relations intersect significantly with a lack of community  safety.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Our model reflects the particular circumstances of Northern  Ireland in the police accountability measures. It is important that we make  reference to the important continuation of the Patten arrangements for police  accountability. The accountability of the police has been one of the great  successes of our political peace process; it has been well championed and has  been recognised internationally. That said, it is also important that we do not  have a fixed institutional design for how that will be conducted and that we  are open to new models. That will mean that the rolling function is clearly  preserved and that we can also move with the times and reflect our changed  financial circumstances and the different challenges and pressures on the  police to deal with administration and bureaucracy. It is also important that  we recognise the important interface between policing accountability and  community safety and that we find that synergy. I welcome the model that the  Department has taken forward; it tries to reflect best international practice  while respecting the very good practice that has been established in Northern  Ireland over the past decade.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is regrettable that we have to consider the measures in  the Bill that concern sport. Perhaps the problems that we have had in Northern  Ireland have not been as severe as those elsewhere in these islands and further  afield. However, we would be burying our heads in the sand if we denied that  there have been problems in recent times, particularly in the footballing  arena.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I recognise the strong work of the IFA on community  relations. I also recognise the very different atmosphere that has been  established at Northern Ireland international matches, both home and abroad. That  has been a major success in breaking down barriers and creating a much more  inclusive array of supporters for the Northern Ireland team from all sections  of the community. However, problems continue and have occurred  disproportionately at the domestic level in Irish League football. I do not  need to recite individual cases &mdash; Members will be aware of them &mdash; but they have  included racial and sectarian aspects. So, it is important, albeit regrettable,  that we take forward the measures in the Bill.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, I want to recognise that legal aid is a major  financial challenge facing Northern Ireland. Legal aid is an important service  that is provided to the victims and perpetrators of crime to ensure that we  have a proper legal system and that everyone has access to justice. That said,  we cannot ignore the fact that we have spiralling costs that are out of line  with other jurisdictions. We simply cannot sustain those costs, particularly in  the current public expenditure environment. Therefore, it is important that we  consider reforms to legal aid that will control costs while preserving access  to justice, which is absolutely critical. The Bill is only part of the dialogue  that will need to take place over the coming years.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We very warmly welcome the Bill. That will be no surprise  to the Minister or the Chamber. On behalf of the Alliance Party, I commend  David Ford, as the Minister of Justice, and recognise the very hard work that  has been put in by him, his officials and the Committee to get us to this stage.  Although appreciating that we are moving towards the end of this Assembly  mandate, we look forward to the Bill being taken forward as serious legislation  that will, hopefully, be passed before the Assembly stands down next spring.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Givan</strong>: I  welcome this opportunity to speak on the Justice Bill. I will not go into a lot  of the detail of the Bill; the Committee will give me the forum to do that.  However, I want to touch on some areas covered by the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">With the Justice Bill, our focus should always be on the  victim and, therefore, on the protection of society. Some Members made comments  that make me ask whether they believe the focus should be on the victim or the  perpetrator, who has more rights and how those competing rights are managed. I  will go into that some more when I get to the relevant points.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The first area is the offender levy, which I welcome.  However, I do not want to exaggerate the significance of that levy, referring  as it does to amounts between &pound;5 and &pound;50. I certainly do not feel that victims  of crime, when they see the perpetrator being asked to pay an additional &pound;5 or  up to &pound;50 will feel that justice has been served. However, I welcome it being  brought in. The establishment of a fund to help the victims of crime is a  welcome step, but we should not overplay it. Stephen Farry said that the levy  would really enforce the rehabilitation of people and enforce on the  perpetrators of crime the need to take responsibility for their actions. I  really do not see how a levy of &pound;5 will have an impact of the magnitude that  the Member seems to want to portray. We should not overplay this; nevertheless,  I welcome its introduction.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Alban Maginness referred to the levy, and his concern was  about the ability of the perpetrator to pay. I certainly do not have any  concern about whether a perpetrator will be able to pay an additional &pound;5 or &pound;50  on top of whatever other compensation they may well have to pay. My focus is  not on the perpetrator; it is on the victim, and we should not overstate the  impact that the levy will have with regard to the feeling of justice having  been served. However, I welcome its introduction.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Alban Maginness made some relevant points about special  measures that we need to consider so that there are no unintended consequences.  However, my initial reaction is that we want to help people who are vulnerable  and we want to allow intermediaries and that people who make complaints of a  sexual nature should be given more protection and rights. My gut reaction is  that I support that and we should take steps to help those individuals, but we  need to get into more of the detail on the issues that Alban Maginness raised.  Committee Stage will allow us to do that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the move to streamline district policing  partnerships and community safety partnerships into policing and community  safety partnerships. There are many similarities in the functions that the two  existing bodies exercise, and to streamline them will be a welcome measure. My  only concern is around the composition of the bodies. My reading of the  situation is that councils will identify problems in their area, and the new  partnerships will go about putting together a plan to tackle those problems.  Therefore, a wholly elected institution will identify the issues, but  responsibility for dealing with them will be handed over to a body that will  have a minority of elected members on it. I will want to tease out in Committee  how that accountability will be returned to the councils, as they have  identified the problems but are not ultimately responsible for tackling them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The bodies will be made up of councillors, independents and  people from designated statutory and voluntary organisations. I wonder whether  the independents will be solely independent because when independent members are  picked, as they are for district policing partnerships, they often have a  voluntary or statutory connection. Therefore, we need to get more clarity about  how, beyond their elected members, we will decide the membership of the bodies.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On the sporting provisions, I am sure that all Members will  support the intent of promoting good behaviour at sporting events. I confess  that I am not a frequent attender at GAA events, so I cannot comment on  behaviour at those matches.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Not a frequent attender?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Givan</strong>: I  should clarify that I have not attended any GAA matches. I see only what is on  the television, and, when we are looking at banning orders, I sometimes wonder  whether we will end up banning some of the players for brawling on GAA pitches.  Therefore, when we talk about the promotion of good behaviour among the fans,  there is also a responsibility on players to promote good behaviour. However,  undoubtedly, the overwhelming majority of people who attend any type of  sporting event conduct themselves in an exemplary fashion, not least, as my  colleague William Humphrey highlighted, Northern Ireland football supporters,  who have played a positive role for which they have been appropriately  recognised. Therefore, I do not think that we should exaggerate the problem.  Nevertheless, we should not deny that, on some occasions, there are  difficulties with some individuals at all types of sporting events. I have been  to some sporting events that I would not have wanted my family to attend, and  the legislation is looking at dealing with that minority of individuals. We  will need to get into the detail of how the provisions will be implemented, but  the intention is a good one. However, we need to get into the detail of the  Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome how Part 5, which deals with the treatment of  offenders, is bringing other legislation up to date. Gaps in existing  legislation are being filled in, including the extension of court sentencing  powers to include the offence of hijacking, which is a problem in our part of  the world at particular times of the year. Knife offences, such as possession  with intent and possession on school premises, are also covered. I welcome  bringing up to date the overall package to deal with knife crime.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that alternatives to prosecution are not seen  as a soft option. I look at the offences that will be included, such as  criminal damage and shoplifting, and those are certainly not victimless crimes.  They impact greatly on the business community in particular. I want to look at  alternatives to prosecution in more detail to ensure that they are not a soft  option.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly should not feel that it is a tough option to  send individuals who engage in low-level crime for prosecution because, often,  they go through the system and the judiciary or the magistrate simply gives  them a slap on the wrist. It is not the case that prosecution is a tough  option. If I have any complaint, it is against the judiciary for its failure to  administer stronger sentences and to deal with that type of crime much more stringently.  As I look at the Bill, it is not lost on me that, often, prosecution does not  lead to stiffer sentencing. I am prepared to give it a fair wind.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I note that the eligibility thresholds for fixed penalties  are around &pound;100 for petty theft and &pound;200 for criminal damage for first-time  offenders. I will bear that in mind when we consider fixed penalties in  Committee. They must not be a soft option. I want and am willing to be  convinced of that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the provisions on legal aid. The legal aid bill  is a big problem. I commend the Minister for his efforts to tackle it. It is a  difficult problem to tackle. There are many vested interests, particularly  among the legal profession, many of whom have made their bread and butter on  people&rsquo;s ability to claim legal aid. We need to grapple with that issue and  ensure absolutely that, while everyone has access to justice through legal aid,  we do not gold-plate that access and provide a level of legal cover that goes  far beyond the representation that exists in other jurisdictions. The Committee  is aware of that issue. Certainly, I support the Minister&rsquo;s efforts to tackle  the problem.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, I look forward to the Bill&rsquo;s Committee  Stage. It is a large Bill. I welcome many of its areas and remain to be  convinced about others. It is important legislation. I look forward to dealing  with it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Business Committee has arranged to meet immediately upon the  lunchtime suspension. I, therefore, propose, by leave of the Assembly, to  suspend the sitting until 2.00 pm, when the next Member to speak will be Car&aacute;l  N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The sitting was suspended at 12.28 pm.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">On resuming (Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr McClarty] in the  Chair) &mdash;</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Like other Members, I welcome the  Bill and its significance. This is a big day for us in the devolution of  justice to this place. I understand and appreciate that the purpose of this  debate is, primarily, to deal with the broad principles of the Bill, and it,  therefore, gives Members who are not members of the Justice Committee an  opportunity to talk. Of course, we have the undoubted workload of the  clause-by-clause scrutiny ahead. The Bill has 108 clauses, seven schedules and  nine parts. It is probably the biggest Bill that we have had before this place  since the current mandate began in 2007.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Despite some of the obvious concerns, the tone of the  debate thus far has been very good. Like many Members who have spoken today, I  welcome certain aspects of the Bill. I want to touch on aspects that might be  amended. I do not know whether they will be amended, but there has been talk of  potential amendments from the Minister, the Department and political parties  through their Members.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to use this opportunity to talk about statutory  provision. We talk about statutory provision for the community safety  partnerships; that is very important, but I know that it is not the same thing.  Other partnerships have existed, and I will use neighbourhood renewal as an  example. When other Departments and bodies were at the table with the community  and voluntary sector, they nipped in and nipped out and ducked responsibility  and passed the buck. That is the last thing that we need; we need delivery.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I was encouraged that the Minister repeated the remarks  that our party made in the debate on the addendum to the Programme for  Government around real partnerships, engagement and, above all else, delivery.  That is absolutely crucial to this Bill and any other for that matter. Even  though there are, perhaps, concerns around the make-up of the board and the  issues of democracy and representation, I welcome the fact that the ability to  put things on a statutory footing is there; that is important. To that end, I  repeat the call that I made in the past in the Committee and on the Floor that  statutory powers need to be given to the Prisoner Ombudsman. That is crucial.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will talk about Part 1 of the Bill in a general sense.  Alban Maginness, in particular, talked about vulnerable witnesses and victims,  intimidated witnesses, and so forth. Mention was made of people with mental  health difficulties who give evidence, either as a victim or as a witness, and  about the role of support there. It is to be welcomed. He raised some  interesting features, which, I think, will be further developed during the  Bill&rsquo;s Committee Stage. This is where the Department of Justice does not stand  on its own. During our recent debate on the review of the juvenile justice  system, it was said that Departments are dependent on one another, particularly  when integrated services are involved. I would argue that there is a better  need for integrated services, and I use this Bill as an opportunity to do that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although there are still concerns about the implementation  of the Bamford review, particularly around the Department of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety, the Department of Education and other Departments  and their roles, lessons have been learnt from the review. The people and user  groups who participated in Bamford are the people who I would encourage to come  to the Committee, MLAs or political parties with regard to clauses that deal  with such areas. That flexibility should be extended to many other people.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We may get caught in a time warp in this place, but this  Bill is talked about quite a lot in the community, for good and bad reasons.  David spoke a lot about soccer. I do not know a lot about soccer; it is not a  girl thing. I am just not into soccer, but I appreciate, and I have been  lobbied about, some concerns that people who support soccer have, which have  left them feeling demonised. Although I do not share their love of that sport,  I understand that there are sensitivities around that issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also understand that, as with many pieces of legislation,  but particularly this one, there is and will always be overlap and confusion  when it comes to law and justice. Paul Givan could certainly not be described  as a liberal lovey, but he made a contribution about the offender levy.  Concerns have also been raised with us about that, but, on the other side of  the coin, I do not think that anyone who has been a victim of crime would  appreciate an offender being given a &pound;5 fine. However, I do not think that that  is the principle; it is about additional ways for people to recognise that an  offence has been committed and that there are other ways to pay for that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Stephen Farry raised an issue that our party has raised  time and time again, and we would not be expected to act differently. Going to  jail is punishment; people do not go to jail to be punished further and to have  their rights denied.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I believe that even with the different backgrounds of the political  parties, the detail of the Bill will be bedded down during Committee Stage. So  far, regardless of people&rsquo;s positions, politically and on justice issues, there  is a sense that the Bill is much needed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I attend a multi-agency meeting &mdash; not a community safety  partnership &mdash; in north Belfast with many statutory bodies, and I appreciate and  value the work of such partnerships. The participation of local people, and the  ability of ordinary residents to challenge elected representatives, such as me,  plus the PSNI, the Housing Executive and other bodies with statutory  responsibility for delivery, is very important. That is local, participative  democracy at its best. I do not see it as being something that should exist  instead of local partnerships. I see it as being additional to them; something  that they can feed into and perhaps have better results. I return to the idea  of real partnerships, proper engagement, proper consultation and proper  delivery.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is much more in the Bill, and the Minister alluded to  that at the start of his remarks. Through no fault of the Minister or anyone  else, it looks like the next mandate will have an in tray containing what is  not covered in this Justice Bill; whatever parts that we cannot get through or  that cannot be done through amendments will still exist. That is the situation  today, and I imagine there will be many more besides those. We have to work on  the assumption, even though some of us may be complacent, that there will be  new people coming to the Assembly next year. They will have their own  experiences, which is a good thing, regardless of their political party or how  they come through the door. They will also have experiences, not only as  individuals, but in relation to the people they represent.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One thing that is very clear and that I am happy about &mdash;  and I was not happy about it at the start &mdash; is that the Bill will be subject to  a full equality impact assessment. I was concerned that there may have been  different families within the justice system who were screening bits of it out  while others were perhaps prepared to go further. It is a good step that the  whole Bill will be scrutinised and given a full equality impact assessment.  That sends out the right message.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also commend some of the work of the Criminal Justice  Inspection, which has enhanced what is being discussed today. We can have that  information with us when we are going through the Bill, clause by clause,  particularly areas such as avoidable delays, because that is relevant to  improving access to justice. Those who have been on remand for a long time  constitute a category of people who are entitled to access to justice, as well  as those who have been the victims of crime or who have been witnesses and are  vulnerable. Many improvements are needed to increase their access to justice.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a list of stuff here, but one issue that I would  like the Minister to look at &mdash; and the Committee, during its clause-by-clause  scrutiny of the Bill &mdash; is &ldquo;designing out crime&rdquo;, under the heading of reducing  crime and dealing with the consequences. That has been an invaluable service in  our community, looking at the environmental ways in which we can enhance or  reduce the prospect of crime. I believe that that service is going to be  changed and centralised. That is not necessarily a good thing; such is the  feedback that we are getting.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are very lucky to have a good crime prevention officer  working in north Belfast. Like any representative worth her salt, I do not want  to lose him. Whoever gets him will be lucky. We do not want a Bill that will  improve access to justice but deny access to an essential aspect of community  safety, which is very good. Sometimes you do wrong for trying to do good. That  needs to be looked at. There is still a lot of work to be done. Despite the  fact that there are 108 clauses, seven schedules and nine parts to the Bill,  there is still much more to do.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This point was made earlier. I have said it on numerous  occasions, and I repeat it every time. I support the total independence of the  judiciary. However, I do not want the judiciary, or any other family within the  criminal justice system, to think that it should not be accountable or open to  scrutiny like any other Department. That point must be made. Take the example  of repeat offenders who have been out on bail a lot. Other people in the  criminal justice family &mdash; the PSNI or designated social workers &mdash; may say in  court that a particular repeat offender should not be out on the street, yet he  keeps getting bail under conditions and coming in and out, in and out.  Questions are asked about why that happens, but there is almost a smack of an  answer: we are independent, and you cannot delve into it. As an elected  representative, I speak for many others when I say that that is not good  enough. That is not to say that I do not support the independence of the  judiciary, but the point needs to be made.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I just want to raise this: it could be about reducing  crime, safer communities or alternatives to prosecution. I would like to see a  better role for community restorative justice. Paul Givan made the point that  sometimes prosecution may seem like a blunt instrument, but it is not the  easiest way to make amends. Sometimes sitting down and owning or taking  responsibility for what happened with the people who have been offended or  affected is a harder thing to do. If the principle of restorative justice is  missed in this Bill &mdash; and there are certainly things that are missing from the  Bill &mdash; that would be a bad thing. If restorative justice is not incorporated  into the Bill, Sinn F&eacute;in may look to see where it can be included as the  Committee goes through the Bill, clause by clause.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Bill and the opportunity to talk on it. I am  a member of the Justice Committee, and I do not particularly look forward to  the amount of work that we need to do. This is the largest and most detailed  Bill that I have seen yet. It is something that we have looked for and fought  for for so long, and I am delighted that it takes its Second Stage today. Go  raibh maith agat.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Browne</strong>:  I welcome the chance to speak on the Second Stage of this extremely important  Bill. As a relatively new member of the Justice Committee, I look forward to  having the opportunity to go through the Bill in more detail when it reaches Committee  Stage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As has been outlined, the Bill addresses three major  themes; namely, services for victims and witnesses, community safety and  improving access to justice. Those issues will not be easy to address, but I am  sure that the Committee will bring its expert knowledge to bear as the Bill  goes through Committee Stage.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There has been a long-standing problem with ensuring that  victims and witnesses receive the necessary support to make the justice system work  by giving their testimony, particularly at trial, but also beforehand. An  increase in the upper age limit for entitlement to special measures provision  is long overdue, as it removes the ludicrous situation whereby an arbitrary  line was drawn between those entitled and those not entitled.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are difficult issues here, and perhaps most difficult  is redressing the imbalance between the impact that crime has on a victim and  on a perpetrator. As we have heard, the Bill contains many interesting ideas,  not least the offender levy. I look forward to exploring that at Committee  Stage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Another big issue in justice over the past decade has been  the idea of alternatives to prosecution. I am pleased that the Bill will bring  forward more alternatives, and thus the possibility of avoiding unnecessary and  sometimes costly trials.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Another challenge in the Bill will be issues around legal  aid entitlement. It will be a serious task to strike a balance between saving  money and ensuring that we do not compromise the underlying principles of the  legal aid system. If the Committee is able to strike that balance, it will be  doing a lot to make the justice system more efficient and to maintain fairness  and equity.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We will face challenges when we consider the Bill at  further stages. Those challenges must be met, and I am sure that we are up to  it. I welcome the Bill&rsquo;s Second Stage.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I congratulate the Minister on moving the Second Stage of the Justice Bill. It  is a much-anticipated piece of legislation, which has the potential to make a  real difference to various aspects of the criminal justice system. I recognise  the challenges and complications that accompany the establishment of a new  Department. Although he may at times question it, I commend the Minister and  his Department for the speed with which they have brought the Bill forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We now have devolved policing and justice powers, and it is  important that we make the most of the opportunity before us. That will involve  working to improve the criminal justice system as a whole for the people of  Northern Ireland, and I really mean for everyone. We also have the ability to  make policing and justice legislation that is sensitive to the specific needs  of Northern Ireland, and we must make full use of that particular advantage as  it has been lacking for a number of years.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As well as containing provisions concerning the offender  levy, Part 1 of the Bill focuses on assistance to vulnerable and intimidated  witnesses. Any measure that will go towards encouraging and reassuring victims  and witnesses that the criminal justice system is accessible and accommodating  is desirable. The Bill raises the upper age limit, under which a young witness  is eligible for special measures, from 17 to 18 years of age. It also removes  the separate category of child witnesses who need special protection, putting  all child witnesses in the same position regardless of the offence. Those are  very welcome changes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are other improvements in that part of the Bill,  including automatic entitlement for adult complainants of sexual offences to  give video-recorded evidence in chief, and permitting intermediaries to be  available to vulnerable defendants to ensure that the accused receives a fair  trial. Such measures are to be commended.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I now turn to the provisions in Part 2 of the Bill, which  expand the range of measures that can be dealt with by way of a live link. On  the face of it, these are very encouraging improvements as the additional  provisions will extend the conditions for a vulnerable accused live-link  direction to be given to individuals of any age who have a physical disability  or who suffer from a psychiatric illness. The Bill also intends to improve the  services for offenders with mental disorders by allowing them to establish  live-link connections between courts and psychiatric hospitals.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is clear that the new provisions are designed to  increase the use of live links in courts, prisons and hospital psychiatric  units and to provide a more cost-effective and secure means by which patients  and prisoners can participate in hearings. However, in order for the provisions  to produce cost savings and to provide for secure participation in hearings, I  imagine that most, if not all, courts in Northern Ireland will have to have  access to the live-link technology. The same must be said about hospitals and  prisons. Therefore, I ask the Minister to provide the Assembly with information  pertaining to those issues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The discussion is also relevant to the court estate. The  Department&rsquo;s intention is to reduce the number of rural courthouses in Northern  Ireland, so access to such measures will be further restricted, as they will be  in any event if only the major courts have access to the technology. In such  instances, the measures may not be cost-effective due to the fact that  witnesses or an accused will either have to attend court in person or be  transported to the nearest court that has live-link facilities. I look forward  to hearing the Minister&rsquo;s comments in that regard.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Since we are discussing improvements to the facilities and  measures to assist the individuals who are most vulnerable and intimidated, we  should also think about those who are victims of domestic abuse, rape and other  serious sexual assaults. The introduction of specialist courts to deal with  such cases should be considered. The judges who would look after such cases  would be experts in the area and would, therefore, be able to deal with the  cases promptly, efficiently and effectively.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The proposal in Part 3 of the Bill to amalgamate district  policing partnerships and community safety partnerships is something that I  support. The mechanisms for public/police consultation are vital, so it is  essential to get this aspect right. Clearly, the current system, which consists  of DPPs and CSPs, is wasteful and a considerable burden on resources. I commend  the Minister on his intention to rectify that. I say that as someone who has  served as a chairman of a district policing partnership and of a community  safety partnership. I have long since argued for that point to be taken on  board. Having spoken to an individual who is involved in the Belfast District  Policing Partnership, I am pleased to note that the current structure of a  principal DPP with four subgroups will remain, albeit with new titles. I  commend the Minister for that decision. In order for the partnerships to work,  they must include individuals who understand the community and have a sound  knowledge of the problems that face them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill will make certain improvements to sentencing  provisions for common assault and knife crime. That is to be commended. My  colleagues will discuss that further in due course. Knife crime appears to be  becoming more prevalent in Northern Ireland, and I support measures to reduce  it and to deter and punish offenders. As an Assembly, we must send a serious  and unambiguous message to the public that carrying a knife is absolutely  unacceptable.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill will permit courts to defer sentencing for up to a  maximum of 12 months, as opposed to the current allowance of six months. Will  the Minister explain the rationale behind that increase? It will only further  delay sentencing and prolong the agony of victims and the uncertainty for  offenders.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Part 6 of the Bill introduces penalty notices and  conditional cautions that are aimed at disposing offenders outside the  courtroom by being offered, in suitable cases, as alternatives to prosecution.  Offenders will retain the right to ask for their cases to be heard in court  instead, and I believe that provisions that attempt to ease the pressure on the  court and prison systems are, in general, very welcome.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although I recognise the potential benefits of penalty  notices and conditional cautions and the consequent reduced burden on the court  system, we have to be mindful that such tools should not be improperly used and  warn against their use in more serious offences. As far as possible, the  distinction between those who police the law and those who enforce it must be  maintained. Will the Minister comment on whether fixed penalty notices have been  successful deterrents in England and Wales?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: As Question Time commences at 2.30 pm, I ask Members to take their  ease until that time. The debate will continue after Question Time, when the  next Member to speak will be Dominic Bradley.</p>

    <p class="OralAnswers-H2DepartmentHeading">Education</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">DE: Comprehensive Spending Review</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">1. <strong>Mr Cree </strong>asked the Minister of Education to outline her Department&rsquo;s response to the  comprehensive spending review.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  397/11<a name="AQO397/11" id="AQO397/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education (Ms Ruane)</strong>: F&oacute;gra&iacute;odh toradh an athbhreithni&uacute;ch&aacute;in ar chaiteachas  ar an 20 Deireadh F&oacute;mhair. Shocraigh s&eacute; seo leithdh&aacute;ilt&iacute; buis&eacute;id don Choiste  Feidhmi&uacute;ch&aacute;in do na ceithre bliana at&aacute; le teacht.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The spending review outcome was announced on 20 October.  The Executive discussed it, and the Member will be aware that the First  Minister and the deputy First Minister have requested a meeting with the  British Prime Minister. It is up to the Executive to agree a Programme for  Government and a draft Budget setting departmental spending plans. Until that  happens, I will not be in a position to make detailed decisions on future  funding for education services. What I can tell the Member is that I will do  everything in my power to ensure that the most vulnerable in our society and  front line services are protected and targeted on the basis of need and that we  adhere to our equality duties.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member will also be aware that the establishment of the  Education and Skills Authority is one of my Department&rsquo;s planned key reforms. I  hope that we make progress on establishing the authority, which would produce savings,  create money for other front line services and potentially release &pound;80 million  over the next four years. On top of that, it would streamline and reduce  expensive bureaucracy and administration.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her detailed response. Does the Minister welcome the  coalition Government&rsquo;s decision to increase education funding in the CSR and to  introduce a pupil premium to tackle educational underachievement among those  from socially deprived backgrounds? Does the Minister intend to introduce the  pupil premium in Northern Ireland?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: There are elements of targeting on the basis of need that we  should look at in this part of Ireland. That said, there are huge areas of the  Budget that I am extremely concerned about, particularly the decisions that  have been made to cut the capital budget and the failure to adhere to  international agreements. I will be looking at how we can continue to target on  the basis of need. If the Member looks at the various policies that I have  brought in since coming into office &mdash; the revised curriculum; giving extra  resources to the schools that our most vulnerable children attend; the primary  school uniform grant, which I brought in for the first time; or including free  school meal entitlement as one of the criteria for transferring from primary to  post-primary school &mdash; he will find that every action that I took was based on  equality and on targeting on the basis of need. I welcome the Member&rsquo;s support  for initiatives that target on the basis of need, and I share his view that  that needs to be done.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  The Minister referred to the meeting that the First Minister and the deputy  First Minister will have with, as she put it, the British Prime Minister. I am  glad that there was no confusion with the Norwegian Prime Minister. Subsequent  to whatever discussions take place, will she ensure that whatever capital  budget she has is deployed according to the priority to replace primary and  post-primary schools that are in very bad shape?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I look forward to the outcome of the discussions that the First  Minister and the deputy First Minister have with the British Prime Minister. I  hope that common sense will prevail on budgets in the North. There has been  historical underinvestment in our capital programme, but, thankfully, over the  past three years, we have been able to spend more money than at any other time.  We have 43 new schools in sight, and, indeed, straight after Question Time, I  will be on my way to the Belfast Model School for Girls in north Belfast for  the official opening of its new school building. I am looking for the House&rsquo;s  support to prioritise capital funding for the schools estate in order to deal  with the legacy of underinvestment. We must continue not only with the school  building programme but with those in health and housing. If we are to do that,  it is essential that the British Government adhere to international agreements  that were made with us.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burns</strong>:  What measures is the Minister taking to protect front line education services?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I have stressed very clearly that every policy that I have put  forward targets on the basis of need. We have shifted resources to ensure that  some of our most vulnerable children get the support that they need. We are  also engaged in progressive reform of the education system &mdash; a jigsaw of  interconnected reforms &mdash; including a new curriculum, new transfer arrangements  and schools working together at post-16 level so that we do not duplicate  courses.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The establishment of ESA is one of my key priorities; that  is the single biggest way to reduce unnecessary spending on administration. In  the past, nine bodies administered education; I want that to move to one body.  We have a convergence programme in operation at present. It is too early to say  yet what measures can be taken, because we do not know what our budget is or  will be and further work remains to be done.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have already mentioned the meeting requested by our First  Minister and deputy First Minister. The Member can be sure that I want to  continue key programmes such as extended schools, free school meals criteria as  part of transfer arrangements, and a raft of other proposals for our special  needs children, Traveller children and other disadvantaged children.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  The Alliance Party agrees with the Minister about the savings that could arise  from the establishment of the ESA. However, why does she not also talk about  the even greater savings that can be found through shared education, not  necessarily by way of a single system for Northern Ireland but through better  collaboration and area planning between all the sectors?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I just talked about the importance of shared education. A few  minutes ago, I mentioned the importance of post-16 pathways. Yesterday, before  I came here, I spent a very productive morning with 600 teachers from the north  Belfast area learning community and from every school in the area, working  together to determine curricular provision for young people. The Member will  also know that I visited the Limavady learning community. On the day of that  visit, I saw young people wearing three or four different uniforms studying  together, as they do every week.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member will be aware that I am actively promoting the  Lisanelly shared campus, where post-primary and special schools come together  on a former British Army base to work with one another. He will also be aware  of the importance of transfer arrangements. The socially segregated two-tier  arrangements form one of the greatest expenses in our system. We are socially  segregating our children by having a two-tier system in which the pathways are  far too narrow. In the past, when children passed a test, they went to a  certain school and, if they failed, they went to another school. We need to  integrate those systems.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I believe firmly that the area learning communities need to  work together and that schools across the system should do likewise. Gone are  the days when we could afford to have four teachers taking four A-level  classes, with four or five young people in each, in the same subject in one  town. The cost of that must be looked at because our primary schools badly need  investment. I always speak about shared education and about supporting  integrated education and integrating education, and I will continue to do that.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Schools: Epilepsy</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">2. <strong>Mr G  Robinson </strong>asked the Minister of Education to outline any contact between her  Department and Epilepsy Action about developing a knowledge base for teachers  dealing with pupils who have epilepsy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  398/11<a name="AQO398/11" id="AQO398/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: D&rsquo;eisigh an Roinn, le c&uacute;namh &oacute;n Roinn Sl&aacute;inte, Seirbh&iacute;s&iacute;  S&oacute;isialta agus S&aacute;bh&aacute;ilteachta Poibl&iacute;, treoir dar teideal &lsquo;Ag Tabhairt  Taca&iacute;ochta do Dhalta&iacute; a bhfuil Riachtanais Speisialta C&oacute;gais Acu&rsquo; chuig gach  scoil i m&iacute; an Mh&aacute;rta sa bhliain 2008.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Education, with assistance from the  Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, issued a guidance  document entitled &lsquo;Supporting Pupils with Medication Needs&rsquo; to all schools in  March 2008. On foot of that guidance, the Department of Education provided  funding to the education and library boards to provide training to principals of  all schools over the 2008-09 academic year to meet the needs of pupils with  medical requirements, including those with a diagnosis of epilepsy. I will  forward a copy of the medical needs guidance to the Member.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  Will the Minister explain why some teachers in my constituency have a limited  knowledge of how to deal with pupils who have epilepsy because of her  Department&rsquo;s withdrawal of vital funding?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: The Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety is  responsible for the diagnosis of health conditions, and that Department works  closely with my Department in that regard. Training for teachers and school  staff on health conditions is provided by the relevant health and social care  trust and will be in line with a pupil&rsquo;s individual healthcare plan and subject  to ongoing review. Obviously, I will not discuss individual pupils today; the  Member will not expect me to. However, if the Member wants areas to be  developed or wants to pass information to me, I will look at that and pass it  on to the relevant authorities.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. The Minister referred to a joint  publication by her Department and the Department of Health, Social Services and  Public Safety. What specific measures were taken by the Department of Education  to improve support for pupils who need it?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: My Department provided funding to the boards to offer training  to principals of all schools over the 2008-09 academic year to meet the needs  of all pupils with medical needs, including the needs of children with  epilepsy. In February 2010, the Department of Health, Social Services and  Public Safety, in partnership with my Department, developed a document,  &lsquo;Guidelines for Management of Anaphylaxis in Educational Establishments&rsquo;, which  complemented the information contained in &lsquo;Supporting Pupils with Medication  Needs&rsquo;. It outlined the specific roles and responsibilities of the school, the  school meals service, parents, carers, pupils and the school health team. The  Department provided &pound;248,000 to the boards to train all school principals in  the 2008-09 academic year.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  Is there a designated member of staff with responsibility for first aid in  every school? Furthermore, does the Department of Education provide specific  training on first aid skills to those designated members of staff?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Every school has a special educational needs co-ordinator, known  as a SENCO, who works with the relevant authorities &mdash; the education and library  boards or the health authorities &mdash; to ensure that the needs of children with  medical needs are met. I outlined earlier what my Department and the Department  of Health, Social Services and Public Safety are doing to ensure that the needs  of those children and young people are met. If the Member has any further ideas  or suggestions, I am happy to take those comments and pass them on to the  relevant authorities.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Teachers: Employment</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">3. <strong>Mr Ross </strong>asked the Minister of Education to outline the most recent figures in  relation to the number of newly qualified teachers who have been unable to  secure a permanent teaching post.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  399/11<a name="AQO399/11" id="AQO399/11"></a>)</p>

    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I  fear that someone did not do their homework correctly before Question Time. The  Minister will accept that there is still the huge problem of many newly  qualified teachers being unable to get a permanent post. A number of years ago,  the Assembly agreed a motion that called on her to investigate introducing an  induction year. Has the Minister examined in detail a teacher induction year  and compared the costs of such an induction year against the current huge cost  of training new teachers for a career in which they will find it difficult to  get a job?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: The importance of doing homework cannot be overstressed, and it  is important that parents work with their children in doing homework.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member will be aware that the Scottish authorities  introduced one-year posts following teacher training. Some studies are being  carried out on that, and, already, they show that a huge amount of money is  spent for the outcome. It would be very expensive for the Assembly or my  Department to introduce an induction year, and there are better ways of using  resources.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have reduced the number of teacher training places by  25%, and we have ring-fenced teacher training places in areas in which we do  not have enough teachers, such as Irish-medium education, which is a growing  sector; special educational needs, which is going through curricular changes;  and the STEM subjects. I look forward to working with all parties in the  Assembly, when we complete our discussions on the Budget, on how we can continue  to support teachers and teacher training. I look forward to receiving the  support of the party opposite on that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  The Minister said that teacher training places had been reduced by 25%, but  there still seems to be a considerable number of teachers who, having gone  through the training course, do not have a job. What criteria does the Minister  use to advise the Minister for Employment and Learning on the number of  teachers who should be coming out of our teacher training colleges? Does she  plan to revise that in the future?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I had a number of meetings with Reg Empey in his capacity as  Minister for Employment and Learning. I pay tribute to him publicly for the  work that we did together on teacher training and on careers advice. As the  Member knows, our Departments published many joint policies, and I look forward  to working with Danny Kennedy in his new role.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Reg Empey and I discussed the need for areas of growth,  curricular provision and lack of teachers in particular areas. Earlier, I  mentioned, for example, science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)  and the lack of Irish-medium teachers. We discussed areas of policy development,  special educational needs and early years. Rather than training teachers for  jobs that may not be there, we encouraged young people to specialise in  particular areas, and we ring-fenced places in the teacher training colleges  for those areas.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Ba mhaith liom a fhiafra&iacute; den Aire  &mdash; chuir m&eacute; an cheist seo uirthi sa bhliain seo caite, agus beidh s&eacute; suimi&uacute;il a  fh&aacute;il amach an bhfuil aon dul chun cinn d&eacute;anta &mdash; an bhfuair an teastas  iarch&eacute;ime san oideachas sa Tuaisceart aon aitheantas sa Deisceart.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I asked the same question of the Minister last year: what  progress has there been in gaining recognition in the Republic of Ireland for  the PGCE that is awarded in Northern Ireland?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: The Member wrote to me about that matter, and I provided him  with a response. I will now get an update and provide him with that, too.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McHugh</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. What impact does employing  temporary teachers have on the ability of perhaps much better academically  educated young people to gain permanent positions as teachers in schools? Has  any assessment been done of the ability of teachers who have taken expensive  severance deals from the education system and then taken up temporary  positions?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: That is a very important question. Everybody is aware of the  need to create opportunities for newly qualified teachers. As the Member says,  far too many teachers leave the system, get packages and then come back to fill  temporary positions. My Department is liaising with all the bodies that employ  teachers; it is not the Department that employs them but the various governing  bodies, and we have told them that they must employ newly qualified teachers.  As an incentive, the Department has made it more expensive to employ teachers  who have a greater number of years&rsquo; service than others, as well as teachers  who have been out of the system, because we want newly qualified teachers to  get opportunities. We have also changed the pay points on the scales.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are carefully monitoring all the temporary teachers who  have been placed in schools by the employing authorities, and we will continue  to do that. If we see a pattern where retired teachers are being brought back  into the system, we will engage with the relevant employing authority. We must  give our young people opportunities.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question 4 has been withdrawn.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">DE: Budget</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">5. <strong>Mrs M  Bradley </strong>asked the Minister of Education for an update on her Department&rsquo;s  budgetary position.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 401/11<a name="AQO401/11" id="AQO401/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Maidir leis an mbliain reatha, t&aacute; buis&eacute;ad s&oacute;cmhainne na Roinne  de &pound;1&middot;3 billi&uacute;n agus an buis&eacute;ad caipitil de &pound;182 milli&uacute;n go hioml&aacute;n  leithdh&aacute;ilte. T&aacute; m&eacute; ag s&uacute;il le l&aacute;nchaiteachas i mbliana.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department&rsquo;s resource budget of &pound;1&middot;9 billion and  capital budget of &pound;182 million are wholly committed in the current year. I  anticipate full expenditure in this financial year. The capital budget remains  under pressure. I spoke earlier about the significant funding that we have  committed and about the schools that we have built. Members will be glad to  know that we have spent 99&middot;9% of our capital budget. We recently received extra  money in the September monitoring round, and all our projects are well under  way.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have consistently highlighted to Executive colleagues the  urgent need for further sustained investment in the schools estate. As I said  earlier, the First Minister and the deputy First Minister have sought a meeting  with the British Prime Minister. We are still awaiting the outcome of that and  the resolution of certain issues. Once that happens, the Executive can agree  and shape priorities, including a new Programme for Government and a draft  Budget. My Department is obviously willing and ready to play its role in doing  that. Once those plans have been agreed, I will be able to assess the outcome  and the implications for further services over the next four years.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her answer. Will she outline the possible effect of a  7&middot;9% reduction in revenue and a 37% reduction in capital?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: It is premature to speculate about percentages. I am working  with the Executive to get the best possible outcome for the Executive and the  Assembly as a whole, and I am playing my role in the Department. Members should  not accept that what the British Prime Minister has presented is the final  settlement: I certainly do not. The Executive are seeking further meetings  about that. Agreements were reached about capital and other funding, and we  need to ensure that we get the best possible financial settlement for this part  of Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  The Minister may be aware that the Committee for Education met school principals  recently. To that end, what discussions has she had with school principals  and/or their representatives about the Budget?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I meet school principals on a daily basis, and we have regular  discussions about the priorities for what needs to happen. As I outlined, the  sequence of events is that we have discussions with the British Prime Minister  through our First and deputy First Ministers and then we prioritise our draft  Programme for Government and budgets as an Executive and an Assembly. That is  consulted on, and school principals will be a major part of any consultation,  as will all education stakeholders. I have no doubt that other Departments will  be carrying out similar consultations.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: Has  the Minister had time to read the Oxford Economics report on the financial  benefits of shared education? Is she prepared to meet the Integrated Education  Fund to discuss that further?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minster of  Education</strong>: As I said, I will be available to meet groups from all education  sectors, and consultations will be organised at the right point in the process.  The Member knows that, at all times, I have met the integrated sector and  worked very closely with its representatives. Members can see that there has  been a growth in that sector during my term in office. I look forward to that  growth continuing, and development proposals have been brought to me on the  transformation of schools and the creation of new schools. As I outlined in my  comprehensive answer to the Member&rsquo;s colleague, I believe in integration and  integrating.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Armstrong</strong>:  Will the Minister assure the House that she will seek to agree a Budget with  her Executive colleagues in light of the comprehensive spending review?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I have said clearly that I am willing and ready to play my role  as Minister of Education in the process as set out by the Executive. I will not  say that again, because it would be boring for Members if I were to repeat  myself too often; I would not like Members to be bored. I will play my role,  and I am already way ahead of the posse. I very much look forward to Members on  the opposite Benches supporting the establishment of the Education and Skills  Authority. In bringing that forward, we would save &pound;80 million in four years,  which could go towards front line services. Therefore, I look forward to  support from the Benches opposite.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Early Years Strategy</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">6. <strong>Mr  O&rsquo;Loan </strong>asked the Minister of Education how much funding she intends to  allocate to the early years (0-6) strategy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  402/11<a name="AQO402/11" id="AQO402/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: T&aacute; acmhainn&iacute; substainti&uacute;la i bhfeidhm agam cheana f&eacute;in lena  bheith mar bhonn agus taca ag an strait&eacute;is 0-6.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have already put substantial resources in place to  underpin the nought-to-six strategy. Since coming into office, I have  prioritised funding for the early years and primary sectors. For example, we  provided &pound;21 million in funding for the Sure Start programme; &pound;50 million for  the preschool education expansion programme; &pound;32 million for the provision of  classroom assistants for all year 1 and 2 classes; specific funding for  planning, preparation and assessment time for primary school teachers; funding  for the primary languages programme and the primary sports programme; and  funding for initiatives to assist the children of Traveller families.  Additionally, the substantial funds in the aggregated schools budget for  primary 1 and primary 2 include over &pound;22 million for supporting the particular  requirements at the foundation stage of the curriculum. This year, we have  already allocated &pound;1&middot;5 million to take forward the early years strategy, and I  have lodged priority bids as part of the Budget 2010 process.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Notwithstanding that, it is imperative that we make the  best use of the significant resources already available. When the Department of  Education budget is finalised, I will look through the review of the funding  formula to secure the correct balance between investment in early years and  investment in other stages of school education.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her answer, and I welcome what is being done. Sound  academic evidence shows that, for every pound that is invested in early years  education, &pound;17 is saved later in the education process. Does the Minister  accept that evidence, and will she reflect it in the investment that she makes  in early years education?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I agree with the Member that investing money now saves money at  a future date and, more importantly, provides the best outcomes for children,  whatever stage they are at.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I was recently at an early years launch at which Siobh&aacute;n  Fitzpatrick made the same point as the Member. We will continue to invest  significantly in early years, and the Member will be able to see that there has  been an increase in the resources allocated to that area since I came into  office in 2007.</p>

    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: For the benefit of Members and the Minister, questions 10 and 11  have been withdrawn.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Higher Education: Funding</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">1. <strong>Ms  Purvis </strong>asked the Minister for Employment and Learning for his assessment of  how the Browne report &lsquo;Securing a Sustainable Future for Higher Education&rsquo; and  the Stuart report &lsquo;Independent Review of Variable Fees and Student Finance  Investment&rsquo; came to such contrasting conclusions and when he expects  consultation on the issues to commence.&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  412/11<a name="AQO412/11" id="AQO412/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">4. <strong>Ms Lo </strong>asked  the Minister for Employment and Learning how he intends to reconcile the Browne  report &lsquo;Securing a Sustainable Future for Higher Education&rsquo; and the Stuart  report &lsquo;Independent Review of Variable Fees and Student Finance Investment&rsquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 415/11<a name="AQO415/11" id="AQO415/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">8. <strong>Mr  McGlone </strong>asked the Minister for Employment and Learning to outline his  Department&rsquo;s position on the Browne report &lsquo;Securing a Sustainable Future for  Higher Education&rsquo; and the Stuart report &lsquo;Independent Review of Variable Fees  and Student Finance Investment&rsquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  419/11<a name="AQO419/11" id="AQO419/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">12. <strong>Mr  Bresland </strong>asked the Minister for Employment and Learning for his assessment  of Lord Browne&rsquo;s recommendation that the cap on higher education tuition fees  should be removed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 423/11<a name="AQO423/11" id="AQO423/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning (Mr Kennedy)</strong>: With your permission Mr Deputy  Speaker, I will answer questions 1, 4, 8 and 12 together. That will require  your indulgence, because the answer will be a little more detailed and longer  than usual. However, given that the interest in and importance of the matter  are reflected in the questions, I want to take this opportunity to address the  concerns raised.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the three weeks since Lord Browne and Joanne Stuart&rsquo;s  reports were published, I hope that all Members have had an opportunity to  begin to digest the detail and complexity of their recommendations. As my  predecessor and party colleague indicated when Lord Browne&rsquo;s report was  published, the recommendations, if implemented as proposed by Lord Browne, have  the potential to fundamentally change the higher education system for many  future generations. Of course, Lord Browne&rsquo;s review is not just about fees; it  proposes a total remodelling of higher education funding in England.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the questions indicate, there are clear differences in  the two reports&rsquo; recommendations. The reasons for that are quite simple. We led  the way in Northern Ireland when, at the end of 2008, my predecessor  commissioned Joanne Stuart to carry out an independent review of fees. At that  time, our fee and funding regime was similar to that in England, and Joanne was  carrying out her review in a relatively settled context. During the Stuart  review, Westminster tasked Lord Browne with making recommendations on the  future of fees policy and financial support in England. The reviews, while  focusing on some common issues, had very different remits; their terms of  reference were different, and many more issues came within the scope of Lord  Browne&rsquo;s review. Furthermore, the different timescales for the reviews led to  differences as the operating context changed. Joanne Stuart reported to my  predecessor earlier this year when the full extent of the financial pressures  was not yet clear. Since then, the economic landscape has changed rapidly, and,  in her report, Joanne Stuart made clear that her recommendations need to be  reviewed in the context of Lord Browne&rsquo;s report.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is vital that we have an informed, mature and  responsible debate, and we started that process yesterday. As part of that,  Joanne Stuart has kindly agreed to update her report now that Lord Browne&rsquo;s has  been published. It is, of course, only right that the implications of the  comprehensive spending review, which was announced on 20 October, are also  factored in to any proposals.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As my predecessor indicated in the Assembly last month,  departmental officials are studying the detail of Lord Browne&rsquo;s proposals,  including the recommendations relating to the removal of the cap on fees and  the changes to repayment arrangements. I am now studying the proposals, and we  are considering the options and potential implications for Northern Ireland. We  are also awaiting the comprehensive response by the UK Government to Lord  Browne&rsquo;s proposals. I can confirm that officials will engage with the external  stakeholder group within the next few weeks to discuss the range of issues  before us, and it is my intention to bring forward a paper for public  consultation as early as possible in the new year.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is clear that ensuring fair access to higher education  is a key issue, and it is worth noting that the existing fees regime has not  impacted adversely on our participation rates. Of course, there will not be any  change to existing arrangements without full consultation with the Executive,  the Assembly and other stakeholders. There is a legislative cap on what fees  Northern Ireland universities can charge, and any change to that will need  Assembly approval.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Purvis</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his answer and congratulate him on his new post. Is the  Minister of a mind to retain the cap on student fees, or is he of a mind to  lift it?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I thank the Member for her question. It would be  wrong of me to second-guess or predetermine the outcome of the review that we  have asked Joanne Stuart to undertake. We also have to consider the Browne  report and the comprehensive spending review (CSR). I can indicate that it  appears that some cap will exist in the future. However, what that cap will be  will largely be determined by the outcomes of the Stuart and Browne reports and  the CSR.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>:  Does the Minister accept that the primary principles of both reports should be  fairness and quality: fairness in that we continue to allow children from  socially disadvantaged backgrounds to access university; and quality to ensure  that our world-leading British universities are allowed to continue to be  world-leading British universities?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I thank the Member for his question. I agree  entirely with his starting concept. We want to ensure that, as we move forward,  we get a Northern Ireland-based system that meets the needs not only of  students but of parents and the people of Northern Ireland. That is what we  hope to achieve. We also want to retain the important and world-class status  that Northern Ireland universities enjoy at a very high and distinguished  level.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: The  report was commissioned by the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor. Therefore, we should  have ownership of that report. Joanne Stuart recommended keeping the cap &mdash; no  change. However, we are now asking her to go back to tweak the report to fit in  with the recommendations of the Browne report. That is almost insulting to the  stakeholders &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Member to come to her question.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: Does  Joanne Stuart have independence in deciding the outcome of her report?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I thank the Member for her question. I assure her  that Joanne Stuart is, and will remain, completely independent. However, it is  also important to realise that circumstances have changed since the original  Stuart report was produced. Those changed circumstances are the Browne report  and the financial considerations that we all have to face. We simply cannot  ignore the Browne review. If that is the Member&rsquo;s suggestion, it is not a sensible  one. I assure the House that Joanne Stuart will be given full access and that  her report will be completely independent of me and my Department.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I formally congratulate the  Minister on his appointment; it is well deserved. What was the level and nature  of the consultation between Lord Browne and the Department for Employment and  Learning? Did Joanne Browne &mdash; sorry, Joanne Stuart &mdash; participate in that  consultation? Will the Minister confirm that Joanne Stuart was firmly of the  view that there should be no increase in the cap?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I thank the Member for his kind comments and for  making the mistake between Stuart and Browne, which is easy to do. Joanne  Stuart&rsquo;s recommendations were presented at a time from which we have now moved  on. Circumstances dictate that we must take account of changes, not least the  Browne review and the CSR. The Member will appreciate that Joanne Stuart has  been tasked with updating her report. All the key stakeholders will be involved  as we move forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Yesterday, I met student leaders at my request. We had a  very useful discussion, and I want such discussions to continue. I also spoke  with Joanne Stuart and the vice chancellors of our two universities. I will  meet the Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for Employment and  Learning later this afternoon. It is my intention that we move forward together  on an agreed basis towards what is best for universities in Northern Ireland  and protects students, parents and the international reputation that our  universities enjoy.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bresland</strong>:  I wish the new Minister well in his demanding and challenging role. Will he  undertake to do all in his power to ensure that our young people, especially  those from low-income backgrounds, are not put off going to university by the  fear of being plunged into debt?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I thank the Member for his good wishes. I reassure  him that I confirmed that in yesterday&rsquo;s debate. It was a useful debate. There  was a bit of political grandstanding, but generally there is an agreed approach  that access to university places in Northern Ireland should always be based on  ability and not on ability to pay.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I also wish the Minister well in  his new role. Joanne Stuart&rsquo;s report was commissioned in 2008, and we got sight  of the finished document in October 2010. Is that a reasonable time frame for a  report into something as important as student fees?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I thank the Member for her good wishes. Joanne  Stuart carried out a comprehensive review, which my predecessor published in  October. The situation has moved on, and what is important now is that we  reflect not only on the recommendations of the Browne report, taking account of  the financial situation that we are in, but that we give Joanne Stuart the  opportunity to update her findings and to report back to the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Student Funding</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">2. <strong>Mr Irwin </strong>asked the Minister for Employment and Learning, in light of the Browne  report &lsquo;Securing a Sustainable Future for Higher Education&rsquo;, what steps he is  taking to ensure that students from low-income families are not placed at a  disadvantage in pursuing a course at university.&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 413/11<a name="AQO413/11" id="AQO413/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">5. <strong>Ms S  Ramsey </strong>asked the Minister for Employment and Learning for his assessment of  the impact that the potential increase in student fees may have on students  from socially disadvantaged areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  416/11<a name="AQO416/11" id="AQO416/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: With your permission, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will  answer questions 2 and 5 together.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Fair access to higher education is an economic, as well as  a social, imperative. Since 2000, my Department has been addressing the issue  of fair access to higher education through a number of policy initiatives and a  range of specific funding mechanisms.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Northern Ireland has the highest rate of participation in  higher education of any area of the United Kingdom. Almost half of our young  people are participating in some form of higher education. In addition, the  proportion of those attending who come from socio-economic classes 4 to 7 is  much higher than it is in England and Scotland. The existing fees regime has,  therefore, not impacted adversely on our participation rates.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Nevertheless, there remain some stubborn pockets of  under-representation within sections of the population. That is why my  Department is leading the development of a new integrated regional strategy for  widening participation in higher education. The implementation of the new  widening participation strategy will be a key element in ensuring that  university education continues to be accessible and affordable to people from  all economic backgrounds.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although we are going to have to take some difficult  decisions on future funding arrangements, one of my chief concerns will be to  protect, as far as possible, Northern Ireland&rsquo;s position of having the highest  participation rate for those from socially disadvantaged backgrounds in higher  education of all the UK regions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A key principle reflected in both Lord Browne and Joanne  Stuart&rsquo;s reports is that students should not pay up front. Only when they  graduate will they be liable to begin paying, and that will be dependent on  their income. Under Lord Browne&rsquo;s proposals, no one earning less than &pound;21,000  will pay anything at all.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Of course, there will not be any change to fee levels  without full consultation with the Executive, the Assembly and other  stakeholders. The Assembly will have to decide on how we secure investment for  our universities and ensure that access to university is decided on ability and  not on an individual&rsquo;s means to pay.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a legislative cap on the fees that Northern  Ireland universities can charge, and any change to that will need Assembly  approval. I am sure that this important subject will receive the mature and  responsible debate that it requires.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Irwin</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his answer and wish him well in his new post. Does he  agree that an educated workforce allows us to compete internationally, and,  therefore, access to higher education is imperative for those from low-income  families?</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I thank the Member for his kind good wishes. I  agree entirely with the sentiments that he expresses. Our international  reputation is greatly enhanced through our universities. We had evidence of  that at the recent economic conference in Washington, which was attended by my  predecessor and the First Minister and deputy First Minister, where great  emphasis was placed by potential US investors on retaining excellence at our  universities and in higher education. We are rightly proud, and have done well  to ensure, that participation rates and access have been widened, so that people  from all social scales can go to university, excel there and play their part in  the economic revival of Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. He will be aware of the worries and stress  of the students&rsquo; union bodies across Northern Ireland. Will he assure the House  that Joanne Stuart&rsquo;s review will be kept very tight, the consultation process  will commence immediately and the Committee, in particular, and the House will  have its findings as soon as possible?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I am grateful to the Member for his question. It  is important that Joanne Stuart is given the appropriate time to conduct,  finalise and present her report. I know that she is very keen to involve all  key stakeholders, and I am keen for her to do so. As I said, I purposely met  the leaders of the students&rsquo; unions yesterday, and I spoke with the vice  chancellors and with Joanne Stuart. I am very keen indeed that the Committee  for Employment and Learning is actively involved in this issue, and I hope that  together we can address the issues that confront us. They are serious issues:  they are financial issues, but also issues whereby we want to do what is best  for the students of Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms M Anderson</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat. I, too, want to congratulate the Minister in his  post, and I look forward to his support for the expansion of Magee University  in Derry. If fees increase, will there be an increase in student grants? If  that is the case, has that been costed, and does he have the costing?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I again indicate my thanks for the Member&rsquo;s good  wishes. She mentioned other issues that are separate from the question that she  posed, and we will leave it at that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The financial outworking is not yet available. Obviously,  it is dependent on a number of factors, not least the responses to the Browne  and Stuart reviews and, most particularly, the CSR. I have no doubt that the  Member, through her party colleagues who serve on the Executive, will want to ensure  that higher education and education in general do not lose out in any respect  on future funding.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  It is something of a challenge for the Minister in that I am right behind him,  which, I am sure, gives him great confidence. We will see how supple he is now  about doing some turns.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In light of the investment required to continue the  excellent work in widening participation, does the Minister welcome the First  Minister&rsquo;s statement that the Department for Employment and Learning should  receive only a light touch when it comes to cuts?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I thank the Member. I have no doubt that he is  behind me, and is behind me in everything I do. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member will be unsurprised to hear that I fully and  heartily endorse the comments of the First Minister, and I read his words with  interest. I trust that not only I read them but that the Finance Minister read  them. Those comments do not simply give me comfort as the Minister in charge of  my Department; they are an encouragement to all of us in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Student Complaints</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">3. <strong>Mr P  Maskey </strong>asked the Minister for Employment and Learning what measures his  Department currently has in place to address student complaints in further and  higher education institutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  414/11<a name="AQO414/11" id="AQO414/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: Further education colleges and universities have  established formal and robust complaints procedures for their students. Further  education colleges have developed and implemented their own complaints  procedures, but if students cannot achieve a satisfactory resolution, they can  refer the matter to my Department for investigation. Higher education  institutions also have formal complaints procedures for students, including a  process to allow for the independent adjudication of such complaints through  the Visitor system. My Department has no remit to intervene in individual  student complaints. Responsibility for the independent adjudication of such  complaints rests with the Visitors and the board of Visitors of the University  of Ulster and Queen&rsquo;s University, respectively.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. I wish the Minister well in his new post. I wonder how he  will answer question 11. Will he answer his own question? It will be the first  time that I will have seen that. Does the Minister think that the systems are  robust enough? How many complaints have been received and how many have been  referred to the Minister&rsquo;s Department from the Visitor system?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I am grateful to the Member for his good wishes.  Had he listened carefully to the Deputy Speaker, he would have known that  question 11 in my name has been withdrawn.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Those are important issues in respect of appeals, and  processes are already in place. Following a review of the work of the Northern  Ireland Ombudsman a number of years ago, there were suggestions to include the  adjudication of student complaints. It was considered and recommended as part  of a wider review, but that was in 2004. It was recommended that that should  fall within the ombudsman&rsquo;s remit. However, the implementation of the  recommendation rests with the Office of the First Minister and deputy First  Minister. I understand that implementation would require primary legislation,  and, earlier this year, the Committee for the Office of the First Minister and  deputy First Minister, which I previously chaired, agreed to progress such  legislation. We will see how that is brought forward and what views, if any,  Members will have.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I am sure that the Minister will join with me in commending the students and  others who worked very hard over the Halloween weekend to ensure that there was  no real disturbance in the Holylands area of Belfast.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Further to the Minister&rsquo;s response on the complaints  mechanism and the systems that are in place, that is not my understanding of  the student experience of those systems. Will the Minister undertake to find  out from student union leaders what the user experience is in that regard?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I am grateful to the Member for her supplementary question.  Student union leaders raised concerns about that topic in my discussions with  them yesterday. We will be happy to reflect on those concerns to see whether we  can make progress that satisfies everybody.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  I join in the consensus to welcome the new Minister. The Minister will be aware  that, on occasion, students go to colleges where the ethnic, political or  religious origins of the other students are not of their background. That  happens in border areas in particular, and there have been problems in the past  at the Magee campus and in other campuses. Will he ensure that, where possible  and practical, steps are taken to ensure that college campuses are open to all  students and not just to students from a majority background in a local  community?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I am grateful to the Member for his good wishes. I  share any concern that he might have regarding the treatment of any student in  a minority or majority community. Colleges have to be safe environs. I know  that that is the Member&rsquo;s wish; it is my wish as Minister and the wish of all  involved in further and higher education.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lyttle</strong>:  I, too, congratulate the Minister on his appointment. Has the Minister made an  initial assessment of the impact that proposed redundancies at Belfast  Metropolitan College will have on students at that further education  institution?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. That is not the subject of the substantive question.  Minister, it is entirely up to you whether you wish to answer.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I thank the Member for his kind comments in  wishing me well; then he bowled a googly. Nonetheless, the issue is important.  Unfortunately, it is caught up in the financial workings of Belfast  Metropolitan College over a number of years. I have spoken to the chairman of  its board of governors, which is attempting to work through the issues as  fairly as possible. It is not an easy situation, but every effort will be made  to make progress in a reasonable and measured way.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question 4 was grouped with questions 1, 8 and 12. Question 5 was  grouped with question 2.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Higher Education: Lecturers</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">6. <strong>Mr  McHugh </strong>asked the Minister for Employment and Learning for his assessment of  whether students in higher education are getting value for money in relation to  the fees they currently pay, given the amount of time that lecturers spend on research  compared to lecturing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 417/11<a name="AQO417/11" id="AQO417/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I am aware of the debate on teaching and research  and am of the view that good teaching goes hand in hand with good research. The  issue is about getting the right balance. It is to the credit of its lecturers  and researchers that Northern Ireland is fortunate to have a university system  that is recognised for its quality teaching and research.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Of course, students choose which universities they wish to  attend, and in doing so, they take into account what universities offer and  other students&rsquo; experiences. They have access to tools, such as the Unistats  website, to assist them in their decisions. That allows them to compare recent  student experiences in their chosen discipline at a range of UK institutions.  In the most recent national student survey, more than 80% of students here were  satisfied with the quality of their courses and with their access to academic  staff.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The quality and standards of a university are also subject  to external validation. In that respect, the Quality Assurance Agency for  Higher Education has expressed confidence in the soundness of Northern Ireland  universities&rsquo; present and likely future management both of academic standards  and of the learning opportunities that are available to students.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McHugh</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I, too, wish the Minister well. In  the Assembly&rsquo;s first mandate, he was the Chairperson of the Committee for  Education.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Parents have expressed concern, which I share, that  university life does not seem to be what it used to be. Universities now  compete with one another greatly in the field of research; tutors are pressured  to conduct research on the basis of status and name. Is it not wrong that when  students pay fees &mdash; perhaps they will have to pay a great deal more &mdash; they  receive as little as five or six hours&rsquo; direct, person-to-person tuition a  week? Students go to universities, principally, to gain from research, but also  from their tutors&rsquo; knowledge and experience. Through no fault of their own, but  because of pressure from colleges, tutors simply cannot give that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I thank the Member for his kind comments. It is  important to realise that students are not asked to finance research. Subject  to financial considerations, the Department intends to continue to fund research,  which is an important element of university life. It is important not only for  lecturers but for students.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I refer the Member to the good reputation of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  universities. It is an international reputation, as evidenced at the Washington economic conference, when potential investors  were very taken, not only with Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s research facilities, but with all  aspects of its universities&rsquo; output.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Therefore, although I understand his comments, I do  not think that some of them are fair in the sense of our universities&rsquo; outputs  and the opportunities that they give to our students.</p>

    <p class="H4StageHeading">Justice Bill: Second Stage</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Debate resumed on motion:</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That the Second Stage of the Justice Bill [NIA 1/10] be  agreed. &mdash; [The Minister of Justice (Mr Ford).]</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Earlier, my colleague Alban  Maginness gave a comprehensive response to the Bill on behalf of the SDLP. I  want to refer in particular to Part 3, which is about policing and community  safety partnerships. The SDLP is anxious about any possible reconfiguration of  the Patten arrangements. Throughout the peace process, those arrangements have  been one of the anchors of political development. Even when the Assembly was  suspended and not all parties were on board in supporting policing, the Patten  arrangements stood us in good stead.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The district policing partnerships (DPPs) and community  safety partnerships (CSPs) are an important part of the entire policing project  and are an aspect of policing in which the public have great faith. The  arrangements have led to stability and accountability, and it would be neither  helpful nor healthy to tinker with them in any way that might reduce that  element of accountability. I believe that, if the role of the DPPs or the CSPs  were to be diminished in any way, there would be a danger that those who wish  to exploit such a situation &mdash; the people who advocate violence &mdash; would take  solace from it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Today is a good time to pay tribute to the members of the  first DPPs and CSPs, who, despite intimidation and harassment, had the courage  of their convictions and ensured that those important accountability mechanisms  became embedded as part of policing here. The SDLP is of the strong view that the  Policing Board should have primacy of accountability for new partnerships. We  believe that the partnerships should be democratically accountable in the way  in which the current membership and composition of the DPPs is.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Notwithstanding what I said, we are in favour of fully  integrated single partnerships that will enable local policing and community  safety functions to operate and be delivered more effectively and efficiently.  That can be achieved by building a model that ensures a clear accountability arrangement  for the delivery of local services and improves the connections among the  public, the police and the other agencies involved.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are dealing with the Bill&rsquo;s general principles, which,  as I said, my colleague Alban Maginness comprehensively addressed on behalf of  our party. I will leave it at that for today.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I declare an interest as a member of the Policing Board.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My colleagues talked about some aspects of the Bill, but I  will focus on areas that particularly pertain to policing. It is true that the  public have high expectations of us and are relatively impatient. Some feel  that, despite the Bill&rsquo;s complexity and size, we ought to do more and that many  things in our society need to be resolved. However, it may be better to get one  Bill through first and see where we go from there.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The inordinate delay in delivering justice to anybody is  the most important thing that I hope the Minister will tackle. Only today I  heard about cases that were adjourned. They were not particularly large or important  cases, but people went to give evidence, and the court then said that the case  would be adjourned and that it was going to do something different and all the  experts went away. The result of such incidents is that justice takes longer to  be arrived at. I have had a look at all the work that Keir Starmer did with the  Crown Prosecution Service in England  and Wales,  and, indeed, he was greatly associated with the board for many years. I am  really interested to see whether there is a way that we can improve the  timeliness of getting some form of decision.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I listened to Alban Maginness talk about the PPS. It seems  rather strange that we do not have some sort of democratic accountability for  that institution, given the importance of its impact on the flow of the  delivery of justice. Perhaps the Minister will address that point in his  summation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also listened to what Dominic Bradley said about the  Patten initiatives. There is something of a danger in remaining fixated on  things that were developed many years ago in completely different  circumstances. Now that the board has taken control of the oversight of the  Patten process, the only outstanding area in which we do not appear to be doing  terribly well is neighbourhood policing and community engagement. Something is  not working correctly in some of our areas, and many people will look at DPPs  as something of a failure and a waste of time. They see them as something into  which an inordinate amount of time and effort has gone for very little outcome,  frankly. I accept that other communities that have not perhaps had such a good  working relationship with the police in the past may find DPPs useful. However,  there is no getting away from the fact that ensuring that we get community  buy-in to policing and justice in general is central to our ability to develop  our communities and democratic institutions. We have to find a way of resolving  that issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I know that the Minister is aware that there has been lots  of discussion on the board and in the DPPs about how and why the community  safety partnerships and the DPPs should come together as proposed. There is  general agreement that we do not want unnecessary duplication. However, as has  been made clear by other Members &mdash; I wholeheartedly support this &mdash; direct involvement  in the DPPs or whatever they will be called is fundamental to the continued  good governance of the Policing Board. That is the only way that we can get  local accountability, local interaction and confidence-building measures. I  notice that the Bill states that some form of joint committee will oversee  those matters, but I am not sure whether that has been worked out yet.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am also mindful that a White Paper on policing is going  through Westminster.  Perhaps the Minister will think about the issues related to that when he is  talking about the matter, or perhaps the Committee itself will take it up. The  White Paper proposes the direct election of some form of policing commissioner  as a way of restoring democratic accountability. Given that we have a Policing  Board and various other bodies, that may not be appropriate, but there is  something about how we get a wider range of people directly involved in our  community engagement to consider. We may have to look at some way of ensuring  that the DPPs or whatever they are called now &mdash; I have forgotten their name &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>:  PCSPs.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  We have moved to four-letter acronyms; I will never be able to manage those. I  can do three-letter acronyms easily, but four letters are too difficult.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a serious issue about how we ensure that we get  people involved. Perhaps directly elected people should come on board. I do not  just mean that they should come from the councils &mdash; Paul Givan mentioned his  concern about that in relation to the democratic deficit &mdash; but there needs to  be some way of ensuring that we get balance on those issues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will move on to the issue of alternative forms of  justice, particularly fixed penalties. I am on record as saying that I believe  that that is the appropriate way to move forward, because many misdemeanours  could and should be dealt with in a less bureaucratic manner. Of course, that  raises the issue of how much we trust the police. The PPS has said that,  because of the changes that have been brought through under Patten, the PSNI is  a relatively inexperienced and new police service and that it has some concern  about those issues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">After more than 10 years of change, we are now getting to  the stage where there are appropriate oversight mechanisms for the PSNI, both  from the Policing Board and the Police Ombudsman, and we really ought to  understand that the professionalism that we require in the police is in place  and we can therefore start to let them use their discretion a bit more. I  realise that that is a significant step to take, given that certain people have  had concerns in the past, but I was interested to hear the submission from the  Sinn F&eacute;in Deputy Chairperson of the Committee, who stated that we were bringing  the Bill forward in the best interests of all the people of Northern Ireland  and that there is a basis to move forward on that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If we were able to have some meaningful engagement, as we  have on the Policing Board, we could reduce bureaucracy at the same time as  increasing accountability and reducing risk, but it takes political will and  political cover from all sections of the community to say that that is what we  would like to do. Nevertheless, in my experience it would be a good thing, and  it would certainly show all our diverse communities that we support the PSNI.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am interested in the issue of taking more money from  offenders &mdash; the offender levy. It is not clear to me exactly how that will  work. Will it happen at the same time as other fines are imposed? Perhaps the  Minister will clarify the position on that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will finish by saying that we are interested in the Bill  as genuine and substantive legislation that will perhaps form the foundation of  other legislation yet to come. I think it is what the people of Northern Ireland  expect us to be dealing with up here. Although we have all had fairly benign  and kind words to say at this stage in proceedings, when it gets to the  Committee I am sure there will be some very detailed discussions about the whys  and wherefores of things.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will offer an observation from my position as chairperson  of the human rights and professional standards committee. On closer  examination, the detail of the law is absolutely imperative. That is what is  judged. Therefore, the work that the Committee will undertake is not trivial.  It is really important that we get the syntax exactly right. Many of the things  that we wish we could do now we cannot do just because it is not drafted in  current legislation. There is an excellent opportunity to do good work, and I  am sure that the Committee, under Lord Morrow, will take that forward. The  Ulster Unionist Party wishes it all the best.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  I became a member of the Justice Committee as recently as 13 September, and I  am aware that there has been a considerable amount of work already carried out  on this important and substantive Bill. When I spoke in the House on the  Department of Justice addendum to the Programme for Government, I praised the  Minister for the work that he was doing. Although I do not want to heap a lot  of praise on him, I feel that he is to be commended for bringing this  significant legislation before the House. That said, however, I have some  reservations about the Bill, which I will come to shortly.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It has been said in the press and even in the House today  that this is the first justice Bill to be introduced in Northern Ireland  for some 40 years; in a technical sense that is true, but it is also a bit  misleading. We have had no justice legislation in the House simply because policing  and justice powers were removed from Stormont in 1972 and all policing and  criminal justice legislation since then has been passed at Westminster. However, there has been no  shortage of criminal justice legislation for Northern Ireland over the past 40  years. A series of criminal justice Orders was passed by Committee at Westminster, the most  recent in 2008. That came at a time when the Labour Government were obsessed  with criminal justice legislation. Such was the extent of that legislation that  the criminal justice system struggled to cope. Although Northern Ireland  legislation was tailored to some degree to meet our needs, it broadly reflected  the prevailing mood of the Westminster Government of the day.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am keen to ensure that we keep a close eye on all  developments in England and Wales and that  we do not allow our criminal justice regime to wander too far down a separate  path. Under devolution, we have the opportunity to drive the vehicle and make  the changes that we need to suit Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate that at Second Stage we are meant to stick to  broad principles and not get bogged down in detail, so I will keep my comments  brief. I have no doubt that there will be plenty of time for detailed scrutiny  in Committee, and I anticipate many hours of deliberation and discussion of the  Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I particularly welcome the Bill&rsquo;s focus on victims and  witnesses; that has been expressed by the whole House. I welcome the Bill&rsquo;s  aims of reducing delay and ensuring speedier forms of justice where possible  and its proposals to contain the soaring cost of legal aid. However, I also  feel that it is a missed opportunity, as it might have addressed some key  community concerns. People are worried about crime in the community, robbery,  thefts and assaults, especially on the vulnerable and elderly in their own home  and elsewhere. They are worried about antisocial behaviour, and they often feel  nervous when they go out and are confronted by gangs of young people hanging  around street corners, in our parks and shared spaces.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I know that the Minister will point to the statistics and  tell us that crime levels are falling. He will also argue that some of the  provisions in the Bill address those very matters. However, he must understand  that the perception is very different from what the statistics tell us. We need  to take action that will build public confidence in the criminal justice  system. The Bill goes some way to addressing those concerns, and the Minister  said that it will start to make a difference. However, it could do more than  simply make a start; it could do much more to make a difference. Some important  matters are conspicuous by their absence. Domestic violence is on the increase  and needs to be tackled. We also face the growing menace of human trafficking,  a matter that was debated in the House some weeks ago and must be tackled.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to look briefly at some of the key areas covered by  the Bill, and I do so in the order in which they appear in it. The intimidation  of victims and witnesses has gone on for far too long, and on far too many  occasions it has prevented justice being done and being seen to be done in the  Province. The Bill seeks to put victims at the heart of the criminal justice  system, and we must do what we can to protect victims and witnesses.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I was interested in the offender levy and the victims of  crime fund. Such schemes operate in England,  Wales, the USA, Canada,  Australia and New Zealand. I  understand the logic of the levy; however, we need to know more about how it  will work. Perhaps we can learn from the experience of those jurisdictions. For  example, we have the ongoing problem of fine default. Is it likely that fine  defaulters &mdash; those who refuse to pay any money &mdash; will cough up between &pound;5 and  &pound;50 towards a victims fund? How much will the levy generate, and how will it  help victims? How will the scheme be administered? Many questions need to be  answered as we go through the Bill. The Committee considered the levy at a  meeting in June, before I was a member, when considerable scepticism was  expressed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill contains a proposal to merge the district policing  partnerships and community safety partnerships. Like others Members, I welcome  that move, as it will produce a more effective use of resources. However, we  need to be careful how those are set up and how they will seek to deliver. There  is also the issue of how best to address the differing structure of local  government districts and police districts. The police need to be fully  committed to the new policing and community safety partnerships, and the  attendance and performance of district policing partnerships leaves something  to be desired at times. We may need to consider whether there would be merit in  having a PCSP in each police district rather than in each council district.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome some of the new provisions on sport, but I wonder  whether disorder at sports grounds is on a scale that requires such extensive  legislation at this time. Perhaps it is. I understand that similar provisions  are already in place in the rest of the UK. I know that there can be  problems on the pitch at some GAA matches and that Glentoran versus Linfield  matches are not for the faint-hearted, but I remain to be convinced that we  need to devote so much of the Bill to that issue. However, I welcome the new  controls over possession of alcohol at sporting events.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Part 5 proposes the enhancement of a range of sentencing  powers. That will certainly help to improve public confidence. We will no doubt  go through those in some detail in Committee, but I am glad that the sentence  for common assault is to be increased from three months to six months. We often  hear of assaults on people going about their work &mdash; doctors, nurses, healthcare  workers, teachers and so on &mdash; and I am glad that the penalty for such attacks  is to be increased. However, I wonder whether that increase is severe enough  and whether we need to go further. The Minister has already publicised the fact  that possession of a knife on school premises will attract a four-year maximum  sentence. That is also to be welcomed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In proposing alternatives to prosecution in Part 6, the  Bill continues a trend towards more fixed penalty notices and conditional  cautions. The aims are laudable: to free up police time for front line duties  and to unclog the courts. I can see considerable merit in the idea. It will  introduce a useful element of flexibility to the system, but I wonder how it  will work in practice. We must ensure that we do not become too casual in our  attitude to the administration of justice. The draft legislation is complex,  and the detailed arrangements will be set out in guidance, so we will wait and  see.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, I wish to say a few words about the legal aid  proposals in Part 7 of the Bill. I fully agree with the Minister that change is  inevitable and necessary in that area. The whole system is costly, bureaucratic,  slow and inefficient. Legal aid costs were in the region of &pound;104 million last  year, while the budget sat at some &pound;85 million. That is simply not sustainable.  Means testing is a start. It already exists in relation to legal aid for civil  cases, and, although I support the proposal that wealthy offenders should be  required to pay back legal aid on conviction, surely proper means testing would  ensure that wealthy defendants did not qualify for it in the first place.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I note that most of the provisions in Part 7 are enabling  powers and that the detail remains to be worked out in guidance or subordinate  legislation. I await, with interest, the remainder of the debate and look  forward to engaging with my colleagues on the Committee and departmental officials  on the finer points of the Bill. I welcome the Second Stage.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I  declare an interest as a member of the Policing Board. There are certain  elements of the legislation that will impact on some of the areas in which the  Policing Board has authority, such as the DPPs. The Member for Lagan Valley Mr  McCrea mentioned that this afternoon. I also speak as a former member of the  Justice Committee. I was a member of that Committee when it received a number  of briefings on the legislation and what was to be included in it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill is a fairly significant piece of legislation. The  road to the devolution of policing and justice was a long one. We had to make  sure that we got it right. We wanted those powers so that we could have a  tailored approach to issues specific to Northern Ireland. That is something  from which we can benefit in future. It is also true to say that much of the  Bill is a sort of catch-up, which demonstrates that, before we had the  devolution of policing and justice, Northern   Ireland was not keeping up to speed with some of the  legislation that was being progressed in England,  Scotland and Wales. The Bill  will bring us up to speed with some of the advances that have happened in GB.  Therefore, there is nothing particularly radical in the Bill. There are no big  surprises. The biggest surprise that we have heard in the debate was that my  colleague Paul Givan watches the GAA on television. However, since he is not  here to defend himself, we shall sweep over that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not want to go into too many details &mdash; the Committee  will look at the Bill thoroughly &mdash; but there are a few issues that I will  mention. The first is the use of fixed penalty notices as an alternative to  going through the court system. There has been some criticism outside the Chamber  of that as a soft approach, but it is not fair to say that. My colleague Paul  Givan said that first-time offenders who go through the court system often  receive just a warning and a slap on the wrist, so fixed penalty notices are  not a softer way of dealing with what are described as &mdash; I do not like the  phrase &mdash; lower-level crimes. Of course, those crimes are not victimless; they  are very serious. Indeed, the impact of shoplifting, for example, on many small  businesses can be quite dramatic. It is important that those are dealt with as  serious crimes but, nonetheless, that the punishment fits the crime.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  I thank my honourable friend for giving way. Does he agree that the Committee  must look at the levies for young people who are under 18? The Minister will be  aware that I have raised that matter with him before in respect of antisocial  behaviour. Does the Member agree that the Committee should look at that in the  context of how those young people are fined, whether there should be parental  responsibility for paying those fines and the outworkings of that? I am sure  that there are also difficulties in that regard in his constituency.</p>
    <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy [Mr Molloy] in the Chair)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I  thank the Member for that. I will come to the issue of offender levies, but he  raises a point that I am sure the Committee will want to look at in quite a lot  of detail during the Committee Stage. The Minister made a statement to the  House recently about youth justice. That body of work needs to be progressed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Fixed penalty notices are beneficial in the sense that we  do not want to clog up the court system and police time with low-level crimes.  As I said, I do not like using that term. We need to look at other areas of the  United Kingdom  in which fixed penalty notices are used. They are used in Scotland and England. It is important that we  identify the areas in which they are used and see how effective they are and  whether first-time offenders who are given a fixed penalty notice will have a  criminal record. I suspect that they will not. We must also investigate whether  the reoffending rates of those who are given a fixed penalty notice as opposed  to going through the courts are any different and whether the use of fixed  penalty notices is a deterrent to those who would involve themselves in the  types of crime that we have discussed, whether it be shoplifting or some of the  other types of crime that the fixed penalty notices will cover. If it proves to  be the case that those are successful, perhaps the Minister will look at whether  other offences could be included in that provision.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Givan</strong>:  Does the Member agree that the non-payment of fixed penalty notices causes a  problem? Does he also agree that if we go down the route of introducing fixed  penalty notices, individuals who fail to pay will have to serve a prison  reception, which, in itself, adds a cost? It is important that we get this  right, because last year there were 1,778 prison receptions for non-payment of  fines.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: My  colleague is right. Indeed, I serve on the Committee for the Environment, of  which the Minister is a former member, and non-payment of fines was one of the  biggest issues it faced, particularly around illegal dumping, and so on. There  is a lot of concern in England  about that. It is reported in the media that up to 50% of fixed penalty notices  are not paid, which is in the region of &pound;2 million in fines.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That issue has, perhaps, led to some in the retail sector  in England saying that fixed penalty notices should be scrapped, and we should  go back to the old system because the newer one is not working, which may be  because the chasing up of fines is not enforced. Indeed, locally, the Northern  Ireland Retail Trade Association&rsquo;s &lsquo;Programme for Prosperity&rsquo; states that crime  against business is having such a negative impact on the economy that fixed  penalty notices could be one of the tools used by the police to combat some  low-level crime against retailers, such as shoplifting.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is a startling statistic that some 50% of small  businesses in Northern    Ireland do not now bother to report  shoplifting because doing so takes up so much time. It takes a long time for  the case to go through the courts, and often the shoplifter gets a slap on the  wrist, so businesses do not think that it is worth their while. If fixed  penalty notices can be a short, sharp fine and have some impact, local retail  organisations will support them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There has been a lot of discussion in the debate about the  offender levy. In principle, I support that money going towards the victims of  crime fund, which will help victims, albeit the amount is so small that it will  not, as my friend Mr Givan said, have a huge impact. Nevertheless, we should,  in principle, support it. As other Members said, it is important that the  legislation puts victims at the very heart of its considerations. Often,  victims have been forgotten, so I am glad that the Bill seems to make them more  central in the justice system.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is also significant that there are to be changes in  provisions regarding vulnerable witnesses and those who feel intimidated. My  colleague Jonathan Bell, who sat with me on the Justice Committee and has vast  experience in social work &mdash; as has the Minister because of his experience in a  previous occupation &mdash; highlighted that as an area that needed to be addressed  in Northern Ireland. Therefore, it is significant that it is in the  legislation, and I am sure that the Committee looks forward to considering it  in more detail. I listened to Alban Maginness&rsquo;s concerns over whether a  supporting individual may have some impact on a witness. The Committee can look  at that, but, in principle, I support the Bill&rsquo;s direction.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Sports offences have been discussed. I share the views of  colleagues who mentioned the huge step forward that the IFA has taken in recent  years. Windsor Park is a much different place now than  it used to be. The atmosphere at Northern Ireland games is second to  none. A colleague of mine said that Northern   Ireland fans were voted the best in Europe;  indeed, they are among the best in the world. Having said that, I think that  legislation needed to catch up with GB, and it is sensible to introduce it. At  Committee Stage, however, it will be important to address any concerns  expressed by Northern    Ireland and other supporters&rsquo; groups.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Briefly, it is sensible to reform legal aid and to merge  DPPs and CSPs. We need to make sure that we get value for money from all such  bodies. Future work may include looking at what value for money we get from the  new bodies when CSPs and DPPs are merged &mdash; this will also merge all the letters  that confused previous Members who spoke and me. We must look at value for  money and the outputs and future roles of those bodies. Indeed, the Policing  Board should not escape that level of scrutiny to determine whether it is  delivering value for money. If there is a better way to do things, it should  not be off the table.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Nevertheless, we will certainly support the Bill, which  contains a number of positive measures. Of course, Members across the Chamber  would have liked other issues to have been addressed but, given the short  timescale, it is important that this legislation gets through the House. As  several Members said, we would have liked legislation to address the recent  rioting, which is a serious issue that is specific to Northern Ireland.  In addition, human trafficking, unfortunately, has become more prevalent in Northern Ireland.  There is also the issue of domestic abuse.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The prisoner issue could also have been addressed in the  Bill. It costs much more to keep people in prison in Northern   Ireland than anywhere else in the United Kingdom.  Although we will never get costs down to the level of GB, perhaps we could  build on progress that has been made already to reduce them. Those are the  sorts of bodies of work that the Minister will want to bring forward in future  years. Nevertheless, on principle, I am happy to support the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I, too, am happy to welcome this stage of the Bill. As Mr Buchannan pointed  out, it has literally taken my lifetime for any legislature in this part of Ireland to have  the opportunity to debate any matter to do with justice policy &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  It has been only 40 years.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  Then it has not even been my lifetime, although it might be yours.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The fact that we are now able to debate such matters is  welcome. Nevertheless, it feels like &mdash; I am not sure which analogy to use &mdash; a  broth of a Bill: one of those dishes that involves a hoke through the back of  the cupboards for items that are about to go off and then, in order to save and  make some use of them, putting them into the pot and giving them a good stew. I  do not particularly blame the Minister for that; it is just a consequence of  where we are, but so much of what is in the Bill feels like it could and  probably should have been made law three or four years ago. It is a matter of  regret that we are not discussing the more contemporaneous and pressing issues  that we all feel deserve our attention.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The aspects of the Bill that are definitely welcome include  updating our ability to manage victims and witnesses. As the Minister knows, he  has my party&rsquo;s support on many of those provisions, which we feel are long  overdue, so we are more than happy to welcome those measures. Dominic Bradley  dealt at some length with our party&rsquo;s attitude to changes in police and  community safety partnership architecture, with the proviso that I think we  will all support: that we must not depart from the Patten accountability  mechanisms. We must ensure that future legislation does not, by intent or by  accident, de-Pattenise the architecture around policing and community safety.  As the Minister knows, we will be paying attention to that at Committee Stage,  and I suspect that other parties will want to express their opinion on that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A number of the provisions relating to sport are timely, if  a little out of date, given how things have evolved in the past few years,  particularly around soccer on this island, North and South. Those provisions  probably reflect where the debate was five or six years ago. Nevertheless, no  matter on what side of the House we sit, it is worth acknowledging the IFA&rsquo;s  efforts to deal with behavioural issues among a tiny minority of people who  supported the Northern Ireland team or certain clubs in the region. I have  never been to a Glentoran v Linfield game, but I have been to a few Dublin v Kerry ones, and  they can be rough and ready. However, on coming north in the mid-1990s, I began  to enjoy Ulster Gaelic as a spectacle. The temperature was turned up a little  bit, so maybe it does no harm that the body of legislation that we have is  capable of reminding us all that when we go to watch or play a sport, there are  certain basic rules within which we are expected to behave. I just hope that we  never have to deploy the legislation &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  It is worth making a statement on that point. The Member said that we have to  take on board and reflect the progress that has been made in the sporting  venues and by the different sports. I wish to say to the Member in the gentlest  possible terms that, although he talks about making sure that we do not  de-Pattenise what has been achieved, our society has made huge advances. We  need to make sure that we are not held hostage to a set of circumstances from  the past, and, thankfully, now gone, but that we look to the future. I say that  because the Member&rsquo;s party has made a point of reiterating the point. It is  important now that we look forward to the future of policing and justice, and  how we build a society in which we can all co-exist.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I think that we are talking about the same thing. Everyone wants the  administration of justice in this part of Ireland to be a progressive thing  that builds on itself and gets better every year. We are saying that we should  not accidentally make policy that creates the opportunity not to build on where  we are. There is, undoubtedly, an opportunity to have less bureaucracy. That is  something that we will all be open-minded to and honest about, as long as the  safeguards that we must keep in order to continue to build community confidence  in policing and justice in this region of Ireland remain in place.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will move on to the other sporting provisions. I noted in  the Minister&rsquo;s opening remarks a commitment to the principles and values of a  shared future. As he well knows, those are commitments, principles and values  that the SDLP shares. However, I struggle to find anything in the Bill that  would really help us to build a better and shared future in this part of Ireland. There  are a lot of very good common-sense provisions in the Bill but nothing  particularly that allows us to say that it helps to deal with some of the  significant issues. The absence of such provisions is most notable in the  clauses that deal with sports offences. At no point in the Bill, for example,  will we make it illegal to behave in a sectarian way. We will make it illegal  to behave in all sorts of ways that some people could construe to be sectarian,  but we do not define the issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As we get better at doing our job, it is long past time  that we have the courage to legislate for the elephant in the room. We should  be able to say that there are certain standards of behaviour, certain language  and other things that are simply sectarian and that we are happy to legislate  to make being sectarian illegal in the same way as, in the 1940s and 1950s,  people elsewhere had the courage to legislate to make being racist illegal. We  are not there yet. I know that several of us on the Committee for Justice will  continue to engage with officials to try to push on that conversation. We may  not get there with this legislation, but every time that we debate a matter of  criminal justice, we should take the opportunity to remind ourselves that the  greatest crime that has been inflicted on our society is a pervasive and  invisible crime, and one that, if we do not tackle it, can undermine the very  many great provisions that we will put into other aspects of our criminal  justice legislation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill does not deal with things that we would like it to  deal with. It does not deal with youth justice. I know that yesterday we  discussed the Minister&rsquo;s latest attempt at a review, and we want to acknowledge  that progress is being made there, but we wish to see a little more. We can  definitely get greater cross-departmental involvement in the youth justice  review, and we can move the debate on.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I was in the Library this morning and picked up a book on  youth justice in the South. It contains a foreword by Father Peter McVerry, who is synonymous with the childhood  of anyone who grew up in Dublin.  He is a Jesuit who, in the 1970s and 1980s, made a habit of trying to provide  homeless boys in Dublin  with some structure in their lives. As a result, he has become the pre-eminent  campaigner and authority, certainly in the Republic, on youth justice issues.  In his foreword to the book, which is a pretty good read on the issue, he talks  about a hypothetical boy called John, a 14-year-old from inner-city Dublin who happens to be  homeless.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">He thinks about John&rsquo;s day, were he to leave the hostel at  9.30 am and head off to a training course. That could happen in Belfast, where the hostel  would probably be under the jurisdiction of the Department of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety. If John were heading to a training course, he would  be not be within the not in education, employment or training &mdash; NEET &mdash;  category, and the course would be the responsibility of the Department for  Employment and Learning. If John happened to get into trouble and was, for  example, lifted by the police for shoplifting by 10.00 am, he would be,  potentially, the subject of a fixed penalty notice under this Bill. However,  under current legislation, he would fall into the criminal justice system. If,  for whatever reason, he were detained, he would find himself under the  responsibility of another organ of government.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That observation is relevant to the Bill because criminal  justice in the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland,  Great Britain  or anywhere is much more complex than merely the Department that is responsible  for justice. A person on the fringes of society can be under the jurisdiction,  so to speak, of a criminal justice process but be the responsibility of three,  four or five different Departments that do not even agree with each other most  of the time. During the Bill&rsquo;s passage, it would be welcome to hear a positive  acknowledgement from the Minister that we will legislate for youth justice in  the very near future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am slightly worried that the provision for solicitor  advocates was dropped from the Bill, not because I think that it is a  particularly brilliant idea &mdash; I think that it is a common sense idea, to be  honest &mdash; but because I do not understand why we are not debating it. It  appears, from the evidence that the Committee has received, that the reason is  that there is a concern among some senior legal advisers to the Executive about  the compatibility of such a clause with a European directive. However, it is  worth noting that England, Scotland and Wales have legislated successfully  for solicitor advocates without finding themselves &mdash; certainly not knowingly &mdash;  in conflict with any European directive. To my knowledge, there has been no  significant challenge in any of those jurisdictions to any possible practices  of solicitor advocacy. Therefore, I welcome an indication from the Minister in  his summing-up speech that we will be able to deal with that issue through the  legislation. That would show openness to reform in the legal system. We all  share that goal.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill deals at some length with fixed penalty notices  and alternatives to custody. Those proposals are generally welcome. I represent  South Belfast, which includes the Holylands  area, and nearly every weekend, there is an opportunity to see, at first hand,  the potential value of such disposals in the criminal justice system. Those  disposals will work, and Mr Givan makes a fair point. If there is an  opportunity for those fines to be collected, and they subsequently fail to be  collected, we should not end up with a revolving door prison solution because  of the approximately 1,800 people who are committed to prison for non-payment  of fines in this region every year. My understanding is that a very significant  number of them do prison time without ever making it to prison.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is not appropriate to put the system on the record of  the House, but I have been told that a person who presents himself for  committal on a certain day of the week and at a certain time will be released  before the close of that day having fulfilled his sentence. That is bizarre. I  am told that that approach still clogs up the same amount of processing time  and still places a significant burden on the criminal justice system to  administer this technicality of getting someone into prison and then releasing  that individual. It begs the basic question: should we lock up people who are  guilty of nothing more than not paying a fine? We all feel that we should be  talking more about the policy of legislating more for alternatives to custody,  the role of probation and the role of other disposals in our system.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We will deal with our specific concerns on fixed penalty  notices at Committee, as we will with other disposals that are outlined in the  Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We all support the Minister in his attempts to bring some  reform to the legal aid system. What is being legislated for in the Bill is not  the substantive reform that we will be looking forward to discussing with the  Minister in the months ahead, but, undoubtedly, it makes some sense. A major issue  in legal aid is family law. In fact, family law per se is a significant issue.  If I were to start making too deep a comment about it, I would be pulled up for  straying from the Bill. However, it is worth noting that the House must return  to that policy area at an early stage.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>:  There is much in the Bill that is useful, and other aspects of it are not  ambitious enough. Over the past 13 years in Craigavon and Ards, I have seen the  work of community safety partnerships and district policing partnerships at  close hand. It is logical to bring those together and to see the collective  benefit that both can bring.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will pick out only the Bill&rsquo;s highlights. I agree with  the comments that my friend from South Belfast  made a couple of moments ago on solicitor advocacy. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  Do not get distracted.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: I  will not be distracted or put off.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">For many years, certainly over the past decade, I spent a  lot of time with young people in court. They were represented by their  solicitors, who, in general, did an excellent job on their behalf. The House  had the chance to be innovative and to look at solicitor advocacy. I spoke to  one solicitor in Newtownards in my constituency of Strangford whose legal aid  bill runs at, I think, &pound;40 an hour. That is massively cheaper than barristers.  If we can get a high level of representation from solicitors and get access to  justice from solicitors at &pound;40 an hour, should we be paying massive figures to  barristers when the same service can be provided at another cost?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Schools, hospitals and everything else can only get their  slice of the cake after the legal aid budget, which all Members will agree is  bloated, has had its slice of the cake. Therefore, if there was a way to  proportion those resources better, we should have taken it. I hope that, at  some stage, the House will come back to look at solicitor advocacy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We see the legal aid budget. When policing and justice was  devolved, it rightly came to the House with the expectation that we would have  an accountable structure. Before devolution of policing and justice, we had the  information on who the barristers who were claiming public money were. If  memory serves me correctly, since the devolution of policing and justice, at  least one barrister lifted &pound;1&middot;4 million of public money in 12 months. However,  under the accountable structures in the House, we still do not know who that  barrister is. Is there any other area where someone could lift &pound;1&middot;4 million of  public money and still not have to declare their identity to the House? That is  a sore that is beginning to fester because of the lack of information.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have to seriously ask: is it genuine access to justice  for the people of Northern    Ireland that one individual can lift &pound;1&middot;4  million in one year and have their anonymity protected, for whatever reason?  There may be legitimate reasons for that. However, it is time that those  reasons were explained in detail to the House and that the issue of that  person&rsquo;s identity was resolved, otherwise the House&rsquo;s ability to hold people to  account will genuinely be called into question.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am glad that victims have been addressed in the Bill.  However, like everything else, the proof of the pudding is in the eating, and  we will wait and see what comes out. There is every reason why those who have  perpetrated crimes against innocent people should have their assets levied and  used to help the people whom they have traumatised through their crimes. That  will receive universal support.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McNarry made some interesting points about football,  sport, chanting, sectarianism and alcohol. It is worthwhile pointing out to the  House that many football clubs have already made this a priority, in advance of  the legislation. My son plays for Ards Rangers, and its players must sign a  policy document before they can play for the club saying that they will not use  racist, sectarian or bad language. They must also sign up to the FIFA plan on  racism and sectarianism. Children come into that system at four, five and six  years of age and learn how to play properly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to put on record my congratulations to Ards Youth,  Ards Rangers, Ballywalter Rec and all the teams within the Irish FA that have  brought that policy right down to the earliest level and are training children  how to play properly. On a bigger level, Linfield Football Club, of which I am  a season ticket holder, has had a points plan in place for years to reduce  sectarianism and to ensure that it keeps to the UEFA rules on that. Larger  clubs are to be commended for the actions that they have taken in advance of  this legislation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is one thing that does concern me, and it may be  something that we cannot legislate for. A lot of the young men and women in my  area of Strangford have put away &pound;20 or &pound;30 a week to go to the Northern Ireland football match against Serbia. The Northern Ireland fans won an international award  for being the best in Europe, because of the  lack of sectarian, racist and offensive chanting, because they clap other teams  off the pitch when they are heavily beaten, and because of their general  sporting nature. We should celebrate that. However, some fans who had already  paid for their tickets and booked their flights, hotels and coaches to and from  the match, have been banned through no fault of their own from attending the  match by FIFA, and now they cannot get any of that money refunded. That is  absolutely shameful. What are those people to do? Are they to travel and not  get through? I appreciate that we cannot legislate for that, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member is straying slightly from the detail of the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: I  just wanted it written into the record that we should support what people are  doing in advance of the Bill. When they have done it, the innocent should not  be penalised.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One issue that should have been brought into the Bill is  rioting, about which I am concerned. I have checked the Bill, and I cannot see  it in there. People who riot in other parts of the United Kingdom are liable to get a  severe sentence. However, we seem to have let that slip in Northern Ireland  and in the Bill. We have to raise the law in relation to rioting and say to  people that if they go out deliberately, with petrol purchased in advance &mdash; and  I do not care what section of the community they are from or where they are  from &mdash; to injure public servants in the Police Service or anything else, they  can expect to face the same severe penalties as in other parts of the United  Kingdom. That should be included in the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">If someone pushes a concrete block on top of a  female public servant in the police, they should face the severest penalties.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The House will have to come back to that. Hopefully, we  will not need to. However, we have to deal with the situation as it is, not the  situation as we want it to be. Rioting has occurred. Rioting is dangerous and  puts people&rsquo;s lives at risk. Those who choose to engage in rioting, regardless  of which section of the community they come from, must realise that we, as a  society, will not tolerate such behaviour. The severe penalties faced elsewhere  by those engaging in such behaviour should be faced and feared by those who  riot here.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with what my friend from south Belfast said about youth justice. I would  have liked it if some of the issues that were included in yesterday&rsquo;s debate  had been brought forward, particularly that of the voluntary youth sector,  which has done a huge amount of work in reducing young offending. Colleagues  who I used to work with, such as Liz Greer and others, did a massive amount of  work in that area. That is not included in the Bill as yet, but a review is  under way. Hopefully, at some future stage, we can include the good work of not  only the community-based statutory services but of the voluntary sector.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the provision to allow witnesses proper  protection when they go to court. Looking back over 20 years, I remember  children being brought in to the High Court. I saw young children, who had been  the victims of rape, having to give evidence. Progress has been made, but the  Bill provides for continued progress. We owe those young people a huge debt of  gratitude for their courage in being able to give, in court, the necessary  information on the personal and intimate trauma that they suffered. Many victims  told me afterwards that the Court Service was, by and large, extremely  accommodating and helpful. Nevertheless, that is still a very difficult  process, and one which I had hoped many of those perpetrators would not put  their victims through. Having seen young people aged 11, 12 or 13 go in to a  separate court to give video evidence of personal injury and trauma, I know  that no service can be good enough to give them the assistance that they need.  Providing help for those young people is included in the Bill. For that, the  House can rightly declare that it has done something of immense value.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: I  support the Bill. Stephen Farry commented comprehensively on a number of  aspects of the Bill. Therefore, I will concentrate on one issue that is of great  interest to me and to the residents of south Belfast.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I particularly welcome Part 6, which relates to fixed  penalty notices. Fixed penalty notices have the ability to seriously discourage  people from partaking in the offences of drunkenness, breach of the peace,  disorderly behaviour, obstructing the police, criminal damage, petty  shoplifting, and indecent behaviour, which is limited to incidents of urination  in the street.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In my constituency of South Belfast,  the number of occasions in the past few years on which fixed penalty notices  could have been used to quell riotous behaviour is clear. We all recall the  disgraceful scenes on St Patrick&rsquo;s Day two years ago, when drunken young people  created mayhem in the Holylands, costing the PSNI &pound;35,000 to police the area  throughout the day and to make numerous arrests.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Since the students returned during fresher&rsquo;s week in  September this year, there have been 16 arrests, although only one of those was  of a student, so we obviously cannot blame everything on students. However,  over 50 reports were made to the PSNI about antisocial behaviour by students in  the area. The long-suffering residents of south Belfast &mdash; not only those from  the Holylands area, but those from Stranmillis, Annadale, Belvoir and many  other areas &mdash; have asked for years for effective actions to deal with  antisocial behaviour. I thank the Minister for responding to their calls for  effective measures, which will give them back some peace and tranquillity in  their neighbourhoods.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Residents have also experienced a great deal of frustration  after reporting antisocial behaviour incidents to the police or to Belfast City  Council, only to find that no legal action was taken or that it took a long  time for prosecutions to be progressed through the legal system. The fact that  the penalty notices in the Bill will deal with offenders instantly will, I  hope, help to restore some sense of control to local residents and let them see  justice being done.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The prospect of being fined &pound;40 or more will also make many  think twice before becoming drunk, urinating in the street or engaging in the  other forms of antisocial behaviour that are covered in Part 6 of the Bill. It  is obviously much better to deter crime by encouraging people to behave  responsibly, rather than hauling them through the courts. The penalty notices  will also remove up to 2,000 cases from prosecution each year, which will free  up police and court time to deal with more serious offences.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, I commend the Minister, his staff and the  Committee members for bringing forward this very comprehensive Bill so swiftly.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: At  this stage of the debate, everything has been said at least once. Before I make  my remarks, I declare an interest as a member of the Northern Ireland Policing  Board.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Justice Bill and like other Members from my  party, I commend the Minister for the speedy process that has led us to this  stage. The Justice Bill is a vital piece of legislation for all those involved  in the criminal justice system and for the people of Northern Ireland as a whole. For  that reason, we must take the opportunity to ensure that the Bill is as good as  it can be, and the debate is significant in that respect.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The main issue that I want to address is in Part 5 of the  Bill, which concerns the treatment of offenders and, more specifically, knife  crime. The Bill creates the same sentencing powers for two additional offences  for knife crime: possession of a knife with intent and possession of a knife on  school premises. Both offences are punishable with up to one year&rsquo;s  imprisonment summarily or four years&rsquo; imprisonment on indictment for knife and  weapons offences. I welcome those provisions and commend the Minister for  addressing the issue of knife crime. The extension of the length of sentence  that can be used for the possession of a knife with intent is much needed given  the recent incidents of serious knife crime in Northern Ireland. The provision  that deals with possession of a knife on school premises fills a gap in the law  as regards that offence.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Very recently, the Assembly supported a motion that called  on the Minister to bring forward a strategy to deal with knife crime, and the  sentencing powers outlined in the Bill are the first step in that strategy.  However, I urge the Minister not to be content with his work, and to push on  with the formulation of an effective strategy to reduce knife crime throughout Northern Ireland.  Indeed, I seek assurances from him that he intends to do that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister is on record as saying that the provisions of  the Justice Bill complete the knife crime sentencing package. Although that may  be the case, I remind the Minister that, aside from sentencing, work needs to  be done to change the culture and attitude around knives, especially among  young people. A criticism of the Bill&rsquo;s knife crime provisions may be that they  do not go far enough. Education and early intervention are vital in deterring  individuals from crime. In that regard, the police have done an excellent job  in tackling drugs. I encourage those involved to do something similar to  address knife crime.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Bill&rsquo;s increase of the maximum penalty for  common assault to three months&rsquo; imprisonment. I sincerely hope that that will  act as a very real deterrent to people who use violence against others in society.  Police statistics show that 7,386 incidents of common and aggravated assault  occurred in Northern Ireland  in 2009-2010. That statistic highlights that the issue is a serious one.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, I welcome the provisions in Part 3 for a new  arrangement for district policing partnerships. As a member of the Policing  Board, I am fully aware of the importance of involving the public in a two-way  dialogue with the police. Partnership between the two is essential. There is  little argument that the current system, in which DPPs and CSPs exist alongside  each other, is far from ideal. I hope that the new proposal on policing and  community safety partnerships can deliver an improved model. However, I ask the  Minister to assure me that he sees the primary function of the new PCSPs as  being a mechanism to obtain the views of the public and to act as a forum for  discussion and consultation. I look forward to hearing some answers from the  Minister on those issues.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I welcome the general support for the Bill that has been expressed  by Members throughout the House. I did not suspect that we would have had such  unanimity when we got to Second Stage. That unanimity started with Lord Morrow  and Raymond McCartney, who spoke as the Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson of  the Committee for Justice, respectively. They indicated the Committee&rsquo;s broad  support for the Bill, which I appreciate very much. I want to put on record the  appreciation that I and my officials have for the positive level of engagement  that Committee members have had in considering the proposals thus far. I look  forward to the Committee carrying that role forward to Committee Stage. The  support that the Committee has given to date bodes well for the future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The debate has been interesting, wide-ranging and, at  times, challenging, in respect not just of the Bill but the justice system as a  whole. Indeed, at times, I began to think that more was being said about what  is not in the Bill than what is. Those comments were largely couched in references  to what should have been in the Bill, and, therefore, I presume that they were  within the premise of a Second Stage debate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome Members&rsquo; contributions and will attempt to deal  with the many and varied questions that have been asked. I intend to deal with  as many as possible, but, inevitably, I will miss a few. I will undertake to  write to Members if there are any points that I have not covered. I will not  refer to every Member who agreed with the Bill&rsquo;s provisions; otherwise, I would  merely be cataloguing significant agreement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Rather than referring to Members&rsquo; contributions, it will be  best if I try to deal with the issues raised in the sequence of the Bill&rsquo;s  provisions and group those under themes. That will be more helpful to Members  than if I were to move back and forth around the Bill. It should also assist  Members better as we seek to move forward. I will consider each of the Parts in  turn, giving a little detail of the provisions and dealing with the points that  have been raised. At the end, I will say a few words about some of the items  that I planned to include in the Bill but that did not make it in the end. Lord  Morrow, in particular, was interested in a number of those.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">First, I will deal with a number of the overarching issues.  Some Members have concerns that the Bill is a read across from what has  happened in other jurisdictions. I do not believe that that is correct. There  are cases in which we have drawn on best practice in England  and Wales  and other places. However, the Bill is grounded firmly in the needs of Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some elements follow on from consultations that were  carried out before 12 April, but that is not a criticism, because the  Hillsborough agreement highlighted the fact that we need to learn from the best  of what is happening elsewhere without, I might add, slavishly following it.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the Bill, we have built on previous work and developed  it in a devolved context. The work on PCSPs, to give them their correct title,  is a good example. There are important policy areas that need addressing, and,  although to some extent this is a miscellaneous provisions Bill, the provisions  are not scraps from the table.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have learnt from other jurisdictions, England and Wales among them. The idea of an  offender levy was drawn from Australia  and New Zealand.  Where we have drawn from other jurisdictions, however, the provisions have been  shaped to meet the needs of Northern    Ireland. The sport provisions are another  such example, and they cover the key sports for Northern Ireland. We are providing  flexibility in how the alcohol powers might be delivered. The fixed penalty  scheme has been included to address volume crime or minor matters that should  not go to court.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is experience to be learned from in England and Wales. We have learnt from their  experience and from their mistakes, and we have consulted locally to ensure  that the Northern Ireland  voice is heard.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McCartney raised the equality impact assessment. I want  to make it clear to the House that, in the first case, the screening that was  carried out on individual provisions led to the conclusion that a full EQIA was  not needed. All the screenings that were done indicated that there were no  significant adverse impacts. However, I recognised that there was value in an  overarching assessment of the Bill as a piece. The full and detailed impact  assessment has been published. The consultation on the Bill closes this week,  at almost exactly the same time as the Bill goes to the Committee, and all the  information will be available to the Committee from an early stage in its  deliberations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will now deal with some of the individual provisions. As  I said in my opening statement, the offender levy will be a means of making  offenders accountable for the harm that they cause. It will be a statutory,  mandatory and monetary order imposed on adult offenders. It will be applied to  a range of court disposals and non-court-based penalties and will be set at a  fixed but tiered rate of between &pound;5 and &pound;50, proportionate to the disposal or  the penalty given. In answer to Basil McCrea in particular, the levy will be  assessed and paid along with the fine. It will not be something that lags  behind. Indeed, it will be given priority over the taking of the fine.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The levy will be used directly for a victims of crime fund,  which, in full operation, could realise around &pound;500,000 per annum. Allocation  of that fund will be prioritised by the Victim and Witness Task Force (VWTF).  The levy will add to the funds available for victims&rsquo; services. Although we  have to acknowledge that all budgets are under financial pressure in the times  that we live in, the fund will certainly not be used as a replacement for  existing statutory funding but will be in addition to that statutory funding.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A number of Members &mdash; Alastair Ross, Tom Buchanan and Paul  Givan in particular &mdash; raised the payment of fines and whether it will be  possible to gather the levy appropriately. In recent years, fine default  reforms have started to drive up early payment rates, they have reduced the  number of warrants issued and they are reducing default rates on fines. We have  a very successful fine collection scheme, which has led to a 30% reduction in  the number of warrants issued to police. That equates to more than 7,000 more  fines being paid without the need for police intervention. That is an  indication of positive work being done on fines, and that work can carry  forward into the offender levy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, a number of Members felt that there was a need  to ensure that the money would not be absorbed into wider budgets. I assure  Members that the victims of crime fund will be maintained entirely separately.  For example, Lord Morrow highlighted independent sexual violence advisers, and  that is exactly the kind of scheme for which the fund is designed &mdash; developing  new methods of supporting victims. There will be close scrutiny of budgets, but  the victims of crime fund will remain separate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members also raised the issue of prison earnings.  Prison earnings are used as an incentive and form part of offenders&rsquo;  rehabilitation. Where an offender levy is charged against prisoners, the levy  will be deducted, and prisoners will be notified of the weekly deductions for  that levy so that they are aware of where it is being applied against them.  Similarly, there will be a clear statement in court so that the victim and the  offender are both aware that the levy is part of the measure being taken  against the offender.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Ian McCrea raised the issue of an offender levy for  those under 18 years old. That was considered in the public consultation.  However, there was a general feeling that, in many cases, parents would end up  paying, and that it would not have any real effect on the offenders themselves.  The majority of those consulted took the view that the levy should apply only  to adult offenders.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The standard way to deal with young offenders is through  the youth conferencing system, which is about making young offenders accountable  and bringing home to them the harm that they have caused. I believe that that  system is working well, though, of course, that is an issue that will be  followed up in the youth justice review.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I think that every Member who spoke raised the issue of vulnerable  and intimidated witnesses and victims. The aim of the provisions for vulnerable  witnesses is to improve the legislation to enable them, by way of special  measures, to give the best possible evidence in criminal proceedings.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A number of Members highlighted the trauma that young  people or those who have suffered a sexual offence can, in many cases, go  through in giving evidence. It is entirely right that we should seek to make  whatever efforts we can to make that traumatic process less damaging. So, among  other things, those provisions will raise the upper age limit under which a  young witness is automatically eligible for special measures from 17 years to  18 years, while allowing a young witness&rsquo;s views to be taken into account when  special measure applications are being made, subject to certain safeguards.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The provisions mean automatic entitlement for adult  complainants of sexual offences to give video- recorded evidence in chief and  formalise the presence of a supporter in the live-link room when a witness is  giving evidence. They also allow for intermediaries to be made available to  vulnerable defendants.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There was a specific question on that issue from Mr  Maginness about ensuring that those measures apply to the right people. He  wanted assurance that there would be discretion on the part of the courts with  regard to adult victims of sexual offences giving video-recorded evidence in  chief. I confirm that that is the case. With regard to Mr Maginness&rsquo;s concerns  about the supporter and the live link, it is expected that a volunteer from  Victim Support&rsquo;s witness services would act as a supporter for an adult  witness, and a volunteer from the NSPCC&rsquo;s young witness service would act as a  supporter for child witnesses. Those are subject to training and other issues,  including how to behave in the video room.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To improve court services, we are extending the use of live  links in court proceedings. The aim of the live-link provisions is to extend  the range of matters that can be dealt with by a video link, whereby evidence  is given from outside the courtroom via a live television link into the  courtroom. The live-link provisions will be extended to allow the definition of  a vulnerable accused to include physical disability and physical disorder, and  will allow live-link connections between courts and psychiatric hospitals. They  also include technical improvements to fill gaps in existing law, where those  are beneficial.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When used for defendants, live links help to avoid the need  for remand prisoners, some of whom may have a history of dangerous offending,  to be moved around the country. I welcome the general endorsement of Members  for the provisions to extend the use of special measures and live links. I can  advise Mr Elliott in particular that live-link facilities are already available  in 18 out of 20 courthouses, and special measures facilities are available in  14 of the 20. The Juvenile Justice Centre, the Young Offenders&rsquo; Centre and  Maghaberry Prison also have live-link facilities. I think he will agree that that  is a good spread throughout Northern    Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Live links are a cost-effective and secure means for  patients and prisoners to participate in hearings without the cost and risk  associated with transportation to and from court. There will be savings for the  Prison Service and for health and social care organisations. There is an  additional capital cost for health and social care in setting up live links  with psychiatric units. We understand that that is already in the Programme for  Government and that the budget has been agreed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As part of the Courts and Tribunals Service&rsquo;s business  modernisation strategy, we are committed to considering the feasibility of a  specialist domestic violence court. We are considering what form that court may  take and will evaluate the potential benefits.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Basil McCrea referred to the concern that victims have  about delay. The Criminal Justice Board is spearheading a new programme on speeding  up justice, which includes close working between the PSNI and the PPS on issues  such as shorter files for many cases, and quick out-of-hours prosecutorial  advice. A new delivery group, which I will chair, will monitor progress across  the system as we move to a more victim-focused approach to speeding up justice.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Tom Buchanan rightly highlighted issues about tackling  crime and antisocial behaviour and their impact on local communities. We need  to acknowledge that there are falling crime levels, but we also need to  acknowledge that every crime has an impact. I will be consulting soon on a new community  safety strategy to help to create a safer, shared community through providing  local solutions to crime and antisocial behaviour. Officials will continue to  liaise with the Committee on that, and I believe that there is considerable  scope to increase community confidence.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Also on the issue of victims, Alastair Ross and other  Members highlighted the importance of dealing resolutely with human traffickers  while being sensitive in the approach to their victims. I believe that we  already have that in place. Women&rsquo;s Aid works with the Department, and it has  huge experience in looking after women who have been subject to abuse. Migrant  Helpline has a wealth of experience in dealing with trafficked victims,  especially victims of labour exploitation, and it is highly thought of right  across the UK  for the good work that it does. Both those organisations work in partnership.  At this stage, I do not see the need for legislative change, but I will bear in  mind any proposals put forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One area that probably attracted most attention today  concerned plans for restructuring district policing partnerships and community  safety partnerships into policing and community safety partnerships. The aim of  the PCSP changes is to provide a more joined-up approach with better local  delivery and accountability, targeting the real issues of concern in local  neighbourhoods by integrating the roles of community safety partnerships and  district policing partnerships to create one single partnership for each  district council.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">PCSPs will comprise councillors, independent members and  representatives of designated statutory and voluntary organisations. They will  contain a policing committee, comprising councillors and independents, which  will perform specific functions inherited from the DPPs. As a whole, they will  deal with all the other functions of DPPs and CSPs and will report to the  relevant council, the Department of Justice and the Policing Board. I believe  that the restructuring will make better use of the resources available for partnership  working and, therefore, will direct more of the funding to projects and  initiatives on the ground.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Basil McCrea referred to the proposals for an elected  police commissioner in different areas of England  and Wales.  I must say that having 10 MLAs on the Policing Board and a significant number  of councillors on each DPP, and, therefore, on each PCSP, is significantly more  democratic than the proposal for a single elected police commissioner, which is  being discussed across the water.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the context of the discussion around PCSPs, Mr  Maginness, Dominic Bradley and Mr McDevitt all expressed concerns about what  they see as a potential diminution of the Patten report, feeling that the  critical partnership between the police and the community may be reconfigured  in a less effective manner and that the Policing Board is being diminished.  However, that is not the case. DPP mechanisms will continue with the policing  committee as a key part of the partnership. At the same time, we have looked at  wider models, and I stress to Members that, in their development, proposals to  bring together DPPs and CSPs have been consulted on at length and in some  detail with key stakeholders before and after public consultation. The Policing  Board has been instrumental in the policy development to date, and it will  continue to be so.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I believe that there is no diminution of the Patten  responsibilities. What we are seeking to do is to establish a wider partnership  that will fully involve the range of other agencies to provide the kind of  joined-up thinking that a number of Members have emphasised at different times  during the debate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Buchanan asked about the potential to configure the  partnership areas to reflect the existing police district command areas. The  simple answer to that is that current legislation governing DPPs states that  there should be a DPP for each council area as well as the subgroups in Belfast. I believe that  that is the appropriate provision to maintain for future partnerships. It will  obviously be an issue of potential change if changes come forward under the  RPA. However, those important proposals for partnerships in the justice field  cannot wait until the RPA issues and wider community planning issues are  resolved. We need to forge ahead with those proposals to secure the greatest  benefit from the partnership on policing and community safety issues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Stephen Farry noted, the arrangements have been  developed with an eye towards changes in community planning. They will tie in  well with whatever arrangements come out of the review of public  administration.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I suspect that the second largest group of comments were  about sporting provisions. The aim of that package in the Bill is to help to  deter disorder and to promote a safe and welcoming environment at key sport  events.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Proposals include new offences inside grounds &mdash; the major  grounds for football and GAA, and Ravenhill for rugby &mdash; and of offensive  chanting; missile throwing; unauthorised pitch incursions; and possession of  alcohol, bottles, fireworks and flares at matches. There is also a new offence  of possessing alcohol on dedicated match buses.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">For football, there is the new offence of ticket touting  and the creation of court orders to ban attendance at football matches in Northern Ireland.  A number of issues arose from that. Mr McNarry set the ball rolling by  suggesting that the Department was targeting football unduly. That is not the  case. I note, for example, that similar legislation across the water is  targeted entirely at association football or soccer, or whatever one wants to  call it, whereas the Bill deals with the three key sports in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to echo comments that were made by Mr McNarry and  many others about the good work that has been done by the IFA in recent years  to target sectarianism and other bad behaviour. There is absolutely no doubt  that what is now seen at Northern    Ireland international football matches is a  huge improvement on the position some years ago. I noted that Jonathan Bell, in  particular, referred to the work that is being done by the IFA right down to  local teams and youth teams.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Almost all supporters want their experience of attending a  match to be family friendly and enjoyable, so that they can show support for  their team in a happy atmosphere. Our community safety unit is a key partner in  the Unite Against Hate campaign, which is supported by the GAA, the IFA, Ulster  Rugby and the Northern    Ireland international soccer squad, among  others. It is not the case that the Department unfairly targets football. All  three sports are included because they link directly to DCAL&rsquo;s safety  legislation. Sectarian chanting may well be limited largely to football.  However, pitch incursion and alcohol, for example, are wider issues. Although  the Department intends to apply, for example, alcohol powers flexibly to tackle  problems as they present themselves, particular issues relate to football.  Therefore, the banning regime will apply solely to that sport. That contrasts  with England and Wales, where  the entire package relates to football.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to concerns about ticket touting, I agree with  Mr McNarry that it is regrettable that the segregation of fans is still  required for safety reasons at a small number of matches. We all agree that,  hopefully, that will not be required in the future. In the meantime, however,  it is important to be able to deal with situations as they arise. Some Members  feel that the package is overkill and suggested that the problem does not exist  in sport in Northern Ireland.  However, the package has been developed jointly with DCAL. I particularly  appreciate Minister McCausland&rsquo;s support and the joint working that has taken  place to date. I am pleased that the Bill complements the safe sports grounds  initiative. Together, they will enhance supporters&rsquo; enjoyment of major sporting  events in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There was considerable support for our package in public  consultation, not least from the three sporting bodies. The Assembly debated  the matter pre-devolution and called for stricter powers. I am pleased to bring  that forward now. Mr McNarry and Mr McDevitt both raised the issue of  sectarianism and whether it should be mentioned specifically in the  legislation. Currently, it is not. In the creation of the legislation as  proposed, I believed it to be more effective, given the difficulty of  definition, to cover that issue by reference to race, colour, nationality and  religious belief; basically following the section 75 model, which will cover  our needs. The word &ldquo;sectarianism&rdquo;, as we might refer to it locally, has not  been defined in law. However, I will take that issue on board as the Bill  proceeds through Committee Stage, with a view to improving the legislation in  that area, if possible.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s giving way. On the point that sectarianism is not  defined by law, can the Minister tell the House whether he believes that it is  time to start a serious debate on doing just that, so that we do not simply  rely on sectarianism being caught in a general body of discriminatory behaviour  and we actually move to specify what sectarianism is, and what it is not, in a  legal sense?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I am grateful to the Member for giving me a chance to take a sip  of water. I agree entirely with him. Yes: we should seek to define sectarianism  in a way that makes it absolutely clear where the Assembly stands on behalf of  all Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  people. I have no difficultly with that point at all. The practical reality is  that it would take some time to agree that definition. In the context of taking  the Bill forward, I believe that adequate cover is provided by using the  section 75 categories, which I described, to ensure that we can make progress  into the future. However, it is an issue that, I suspect, needs to be  addressed; regrettably, not just in the field of sporting events.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I believe that that largely covers points that were raised  on sporting matters. Most Members who raised them are not in the Chamber.  Therefore, I take it that no one else will want to intervene.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will now deal with the treatment of offenders. The Bill  is largely not about new sentencing powers, because there was a major overhaul  of sentencing in the Criminal Justice (Northern Ireland) Order 2008. The  focus of the Bill is on victims, community safety and doing our business  better.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Having said that, I am taking the opportunity to make a  small number of improvements to sentencing arrangements. The aim of the  sentencing provisions, or &ldquo;Treatment of Offenders&rdquo;, as Part 5 is titled, is to  adjust and to improve existing sentencing powers that address problems that are  caused by gaps or inconsistencies in existing laws. The first provision is an  increase in the maximum penalty that is available to Magistrate&rsquo;s Courts for  the offence of common assault from three months&rsquo; imprisonment to six months&rsquo;  imprisonment. There is also a clause to increase the maximum penalties that are  available for the offence of possessing a weapon on school premises &mdash; for  example, a knife &mdash; to four years&rsquo; imprisonment. A number of Members commented  on those two points, and their comments were generally favourable.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The third provision is an increase in the maximum period of  sentence deferment to 12 months, with one exception, which is for interim  driving disqualifications. That will allow a judge to see, for example, how  someone responds to a programme that addresses behavioural problems or  addiction before passing final sentence, and that could give an offender the  motivation that he or she needs to address the problem. Some Members suggested  that that could increase difficulties for victims. I am not sure that that is  necessarily the case. I believe that the clause will provide a way of ensuring  a longer period on trial for any individual who receives that deferment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Part 5 also includes an enhancement of the powers to  address a breach of licence by a sex offender who lives outside the  jurisdiction and a provision to extend the court sentencing powers by including  the offence of hijacking in the public protection sentences regime.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are three somewhat technical amendments. The first  concerns closure orders, which, for up to three months, close premises that are  being used for activities that relate to certain prostitution or pornography  offences. The second is to fill an existing gap in financial reporting law,  which will include the offences of money laundering, corruption and fraud  within the remit of a financial reporting order. The final technical change  will allow Northern Ireland  to comply fully with the EU framework decision on the mutual recognition of  fixed penalties. I suspect the fact that no comments were made about any of  those points indicates how technical they are.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome Members&rsquo; support for the points that I  highlighted earlier, particularly about knives and offensive weapons. That  completes our package of sentencing powers in that area, and it means that  sentences will be even higher than those in England  and Wales.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Elliott and other Members raised the deferment of  sentences. I believe that there are real prospects for getting offenders&rsquo;  behavioural issues sorted out and for better engagement by allowing for the  longer time before sentencing and that, in the end, it will be a better  prospect for victims.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Jonathan Bell raised the issue of what he saw as inadequate  sentencing for rioting. The law does take sentencing for rioting extremely  seriously. It is possible to get a public protection sentence with the maximum  penalty of life. Attacks on police or firefighters, even at the lower end of  seriousness, can attract up to two years in jail in the Crown Court. An assault  occasioning actual bodily harm could attract a sentence of up to five years in  jail. We will continue to keep the law under review to ensure that appropriate  sentences are available to courts.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A number of Members raised issues about the plans for  alternatives to prosecution. The aim of the alternatives to prosecution powers  is to create new diversionary disposals; to create wider fixed penalty notice  powers to deal effectively with minor offences outside the courtroom, thereby  maximising the time that is spent on front line policing duties; to contribute  to reducing avoidable delay in the justice system; to assist in the  rehabilitation of offenders; and to improve the response to victims. Offenders  will retain the right to ask to have their case heard at court.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Fixed penalty notices will be available to first-time or  non-habitual offenders from the police without direction from the Public  Prosecution Service, thus offering the opportunity to discharge liability for  the offence by paying a fixed penalty within 28 days. The penalty will be fixed  at &pound;40 or &pound;80, depending on the offence. The eligible offences are simple  drunk; breach of the peace; disorderly behaviour; obstructing police; indecent behaviour;  criminal damage, the guidance for which will state for damage that is valued at  less than &pound;200; and petty shoplifting, the guidance for which will state for a  first-time offence involving goods of up to &pound;100 in value. Failure to take  action will result in the notice being registered as a court fine, with the  value uplifted by 50%.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Conditional cautions will enable prosecutors to attach  rehabilitative and reparative conditions with which the offender must comply or  face reconsideration of prosecution for the original offence. Various forms of  guidance and codes will be produced to deal with each of those options. My  Department can issue guidance to police on the fixed penalty notice scheme. It  will state that damage offences should be limited, as should petty shoplifting,  as I outlined. I will develop and lay before the Assembly a code of practice  for conditional cautions. The Director of Public Prosecutions will also produce  guidance for prosecutors on the type of offence for which conditional cautions  might be usable.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome Members&rsquo; acknowledgement that alternatives to  prosecutions are not about being soft on the offender. I note in particular the  comments made by Conall McDevitt and Anna Lo, wearing their South   Belfast constituency hats, about certain elements of antisocial  behaviour. As Anna said, antisocial behaviour does not occur in the Holylands  alone. I think that the alternatives will have importance in other places,  including, dare I say it, South Antrim. The  alternatives are largely aimed at first-time and non-habitual offenders. Being  caught and interviewed by the police will have a sobering effect in its own  right. That will be reinforced by the need to make immediate restitution for  their actions through paying a financial penalty or by making reparation to a  victim.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with the point, which was made by Tom Elliott, that  England and Wales were  overly ambitious about fixed penalty notices. There were proposals to extend  them to a much wider range of offences. There was a realisation that they were  going too far and bringing into the regime matters that should have gone for  prosecution. We have learnt from that. Although our proposals will have a big  impact on releasing police resources, we are being careful about the choice of  offences suitable for fixed penalties. In that context, C&aacute;ral N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n  suggested that more work be done on restorative justice and that it was a place  where alternatives may not fit or work. I agree. We have restorative approaches  where those are appropriate. There are issues that are part of our youth  justice system, and the Bill will increase the options by way of the  conditional cautions that we are creating.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although I welcome the general endorsement for alternatives  to prosecutions from, amongst others, Mr Givan, I need to refer to his comments  on sentencing and on the role of the judiciary. Members will appreciate that  we, as the legislators, need to be careful, even in general terms, in what we  say about the responsibilities of the judiciary. We are under a duty to uphold  the continued independence of the judiciary. Our role is to ensure that the  right legislation arrangements are in place. The Lord Chief Justice&rsquo;s recent  initiative to bring more transparency to sentencing will help to demonstrate  the range of considerations that judges need to take into account, and the  Department&rsquo;s consultation on sentencing guidelines mechanisms seeks to build  further on that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members were broadly supportive of the proposals for the  reform of legal aid. The changes are to provide a rule-making power for a means  test for the grant of criminal legal aid and a separate enabling power to allow  courts greater power to recover costs from legally aided defendants who are  convicted. The provisions also remove the restriction on the Northern Ireland  Legal Services Commission from establishing or funding services under  litigation funding agreements. There are a series of miscellaneous amendments,  which fill the small gaps in the existing law. That issue did not attract a  huge amount of comment. There was broad support for the proposals in the area,  and Alban Maginness, in particular, noted that they were overdue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Agreement about the importance of ensuring that there was  fair and effective access to justice was forthcoming from a number of Members.  Lord Morrow, Mr McCartney and Alban Maginness drew attention to the need to set  any new financial eligibility threshold for criminal legal aid at a level that  will not diminish access to justice. Tom Buchanan also pointed out the need to  ensure that, if they were wealthy, defendants should not be supported by  taxpayers. I agree with those points and with the underlying principles that  any means test must ensure that those who genuinely need financial support to  secure effective access to justice should have access to that support. However,  Mr McCartney noted the importance of the full equality impact assessment of any  fixed means test.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The detail of the operation of any fixed eligibility  threshold in criminal legal aid will be the subject of further public  consultation and scrutiny by the Justice Committee, as subordinate legislation  will be required to implement it. I take this opportunity to confirm that a  full equality impact assessment will also be carried out.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McNarry asked whether I would provide the Assembly with  figures on eligibility and costs. I have commissioned detailed research on the  impact of introducing a fixed eligibility threshold to establish what  proportion of people in Northern    Ireland would have to contribute to defence  costs, depending on the level of the threshold. I will be happy to share the  results of the research with the Assembly. I expect to have those results next  month.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McNarry also asked about support for those victims of  domestic violence who seek non-molestation orders. A number of other Members  raised domestic violence, and the issue has been raised with me by Women&rsquo;s Aid  also. I have asked my officials to examine whether it would be possible to  adjust the arrangements for civil legal aid in such cases to allow a victim of  domestic violence immediate access to legal aid to seek a non-molestation order  before a means test is carried out to ensure that person&rsquo;s immediate safety,  with any possible contribution being pursued at a later stage. I hope to be  able to bring a proposal on that to the Assembly and, subject to the approval  of the Justice Committee and the Assembly, it should be possible to take any  necessary subordinate legislation through the Assembly early next year. I  believe that that will answer Members&rsquo; concerns.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A number of Members asked why the public purse should pay  the defence costs of those who can afford to pay their own. I agree; those costs  simply should not fall to the public purse. That is what the provisions for the  recovery of defence costs orders (RDCO) are intended to achieve. Each case  would be assessed individually. Our intention is that only convicted defendants  who have ample means to pay for the cost of their defence will be the subject  of an RCDO. Members asked about the timescales for the introduction of those  and whether they can be applied retrospectively. The Bill will provide the  enabling powers for subordinate legislation, which will require consultation  and scrutiny by the Justice Committee in the normal way, but it is hoped to  bring forward that subordinate legislation during 2011. As Members are aware,  there is a general presumption that legislation should not be retrospective,  particularly when it imposes a penalty on any individual.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McNarry asked why civil legal aid could not fund itself,  given that cases are usually settled or won. It is not the case that most civil  cases result in payment of damages. Many other actions are funded by legal aid;  for example, some court orders to protect victims of domestic violence and  court actions to secure proper access to children after divorce. However, we  are proposing to facilitate the setting up of a civil legal aid fund for money  damages cases, which would be largely self-financing. The provision in the Bill  removes an existing prohibition that would prevent government contributing to  the start-up costs for such a fund.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Jonathan Bell also made a number of points on legal aid. Although  I accept that legal aid expenditure must be cut, it is not quite accurate to  suggest that solicitor advocates would necessarily be paid at lower rates than  barristers. There are a number of different rates, and I will write to him  setting out the detail of that. The publication of the list of high-earning  barristers that he referred to has been delayed because of issues raised by the  Bar, but I understand that those issues are close to resolution. In addition to  those points, the review of access to justice in Northern Ireland, which is  under way, will look at other areas of civil legal aid and consider whether we  are getting the best value out of the available resources.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Part 8 deals with a number of miscellaneous matters to make  improvements to the powers available to courts, along with several other  business improvement matters. The miscellaneous provisions include opening up  the court tiers to which a compassionate bail or repeat bail application can be  made; adjusting the membership of the Crown Court Rules Committee and the Court  of Judicature Rules Committee; allowing a Magistrate&rsquo;s Court in criminal  proceedings to consider applications for witness summonses in respect of any  evidence likely to assist a party to the proceedings in presenting their case;  allowing court rules to be made specifying the circumstances in which the  disclosure of information relating to family proceedings concerning children is  permitted; improving arrangements for appeals and the proceeds of crime law;  adjusting the processes around the preparation of Northern Ireland Law  Commission accounts; allowing Access Northern Ireland to issue a copy of a  criminal record certificate or basic disclosure to an employer where that  employer was specifically identified within the application; and repealing an  existing offence under the Vagrancy Act 1824; and creating a more modern  equivalent free-standing offence and penalty for being armed with a weapon with  intent to commit a serious offence.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In my opening speech, I mentioned that a number of items  that I had intended to bring forward in the Bill had not been included. Those  were proposals relating to solicitor advocates, adjustments to court funds  legislation, and provisions for enhanced powers for the police in relation to  cross-border travel of sex offenders and how reporting and monitoring might be  improved. There are two additional issues relating to some late changes that I  made to my sports law package, and some further engagement with the Executive  relating to clause 34.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Lord Morrow, along with a number of other Members,  commented on the removal of the solicitor advocate powers. I was certainly  disappointed that those clauses were not in the Bill on its introduction. I was  advised that the clauses as drafted may be outside the competence of the  Assembly. My officials are working with the Attorney General&rsquo;s office, and my  aim is to bring back at Consideration Stage a provision that allows for  solicitor advocacy in the higher courts, but addresses any concerns about  competence, particularly about European legislation. That may involve putting  additional procedures in place, which we are considering. The Law Society is  understandably disappointed that the clauses were removed from the Bill. It has  been advised that I hope to table an amended clause in due course.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Also, with respect to what is not in the Bill, Mr Maginness  referred to the relationship between the Public Prosecution Service and the  Assembly and to wider issues of sentencing, and Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n referred to  restorative justice, as I highlighted earlier. On the first of those, I have  been in discussion with the First Minister and deputy First Minister about the  new arrangements grounded in the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002, which  we inherited. I assure Mr Maginness that we intend to consult in the new year  on the right balance of arrangements, as we are currently consulting on the  other issue that he raised, that of sentencing guidelines mechanisms.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On restorative justice, Members should bear in mind that  this Bill is only a part of wider work. In meetings recently, I have been glad  to hear first hand of the work of Community Restorative Justice (Ireland) and of Northern Ireland alternatives. I am  aware, too, of how the Northern    Ireland model of youth conferencing, with  restorative justice at its heart, has been recommended by independent experts  for adoption elsewhere. Probation Board and Prison Service staff have also been  trained in restorative practices. I look forward to further discussion on the  role of restorative approaches, including their reference to victims of crime.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Other issues that were highlighted as not included in the  Bill are youth justice and family law. I am open to hearing Members&rsquo; comments  on family law. I suspect that if they want a consultation, we are too late for  this Bill. I announced a review of arrangements for youth justice only  yesterday, so it would be difficult to include any provisions in the Bill if we  are to have a meaningful consultation on them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I indicated at the outset that if there are matters that I  have failed to address &mdash; and I am sure that there are, given the breadth of  today&rsquo;s debate &mdash; I will respond to Members. There will also be further  opportunities during the Committee&rsquo;s detailed scrutiny of the Bill. I am  grateful to all the Members who have contributed in this helpful debate. I am  pleased by the broad support given to the Bill, especially by members of the  Justice Committee. Clearly, bringing such a large Bill to fruition within the  current Assembly mandate will be a significant challenge, but Members&rsquo; comments  today give me confidence that it can be achieved. I will pay particular  attention to all that has been said in the debate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am confident that this first Justice Bill before a  devolved Northern Ireland Assembly, the first such legislation in almost 40  years, will be a major step forward for Northern Ireland. It comes in the  wider context of capitalising on the benefits of devolution and, not least, as  has been highlighted, on the importance of a partnership approach with other  Departments and sectors as we tackle offending. This is a significant step for  devolution and for this Assembly. It is also a significant step for community  safety, victims of crime and setting in train a process to deliver a better  justice system for all the people of Northern Ireland. I commend the  Bill to the House.</p>

    <p class="B3BodyText">The details of the motion give some indication of the wide  range of work undertaken by the Public Accounts Committee in its contribution  to a better and more efficient delivery of public services. There is not time  for me to go into all the items listed in the motion, but I would like to  remind Members of the role of the Public Accounts Committee and the scope of  the Committee&rsquo;s work.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee is a Standing Committee of the Assembly set  up under the 1998 Act to consider accounts, and reports of accounts, laid  before the Assembly. The accounts of all the Departments and most public sector  bodies are prepared and laid by the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&amp;AG),  the head of the Audit Office. The C&amp;AG may also make value-for-money  reports and reports on efficiency and effectiveness. The Audit Office&rsquo;s role is  to closely examine public expenditure from a position independent of  government. I commend the Audit Office for the excellent support it provides to  the Committee. I have in the past described the Audit Office as a natural  scrutiny partner to the Assembly, complementing the system of checks and  balances fundamental to a healthy democracy. That scrutiny role will be all the  more significant in today&rsquo;s economic climate as value for money in the public  sector becomes even more important.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A LeasCheann Comhairle, a group of Turkish interns, who are  interested in financial governance, is visiting today &mdash; they are in the Public  Gallery. They are here with the Department of Finance and Personnel and are  very welcome.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Audit Office reports enable the Public Accounts  Committee to focus on experiences in public expenditure from which lessons must  be learned. This year, the Committee has again worked to reinforce the  standards required of people in public life; to prevent fraud and to encourage  whistle-blowers; to improve processes, checks and controls for managing public  money; and to promote good governance, accountability and value for the  taxpayer.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee is dogged and creative in its role and has  this year identified ways in which Departments can improve data sharing in  public bodies to communicate better about public money and to make savings. The  Committee has also reinforced messages about the accuracy of information  provided to Committees and MLAs, revisiting the findings of its 2008 report  into the use of consultants to do so. It has taken a close interest in what  constitutes a centre of procurement expertise (COPE). It took evidence from the  Commissioner for Public Appointments, Felicity Huston, whose office&rsquo;s role in  improving accountability is vital to good governance.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This year, the Committee joined the debate about how  devolved justice powers might impact on public expenditure by working on the  Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s memorandum on combating organised crime. It  heard from the PSNI and Departments about counterfeit goods, fuel laundering  and people trafficking, and it made recommendations for improved inter-agency  working before referring the report to the Justice Committee.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee addressed some of its business in a composite  report, as it has done previously. That report examined five key issues of  concern by correspondence and has been circulated to Members, who will no doubt  be familiar with the contents. The Committee published its first thematic  report this year, which was debated in the Chamber in June. The Committee also  selected 14 Audit Office reports to deal with as its priority business; I will  address one or two of them before other Members address the motion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The review of Valence Technology and the report on  suspected contract fraud demonstrate important lessons about individual  responsibility for financial management as well as the danger of having a lax  organisational culture. From the smallest repairs contracts to major inward  investment awards, transactions made with taxpayers&rsquo; money must be taken  seriously. A contract should not be given to a family member just because it is  a small contract, and a big contract does not mean that all preliminary checks  can be short-circuited to fight off competition.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee examined the 14-year history of Valence, a major inward  investment project that was handled by the Industrial Development Board (IDB).  It was the biggest single investment ever made here. The IDB offered Valence over &pound;30 million in assistance to establish a new  large-scale battery manufacturing facility at Mallusk; in return, Valence was to invest  &pound;147 million and create 660 jobs. Although the size of the investment is  memorable, what really sticks in my mind about the project, and in the minds of  many Committee members, is that the IDB kept funding it, even though the  company hoped to manufacture a battery at a cost of $57 and then sell it for  $12.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The project experienced persistent difficulties, and the  breakthrough product did not materialise. In 2003, some 10 years after its  first contact with the IDB, Valence relocated  its manufacturing operation to China.  After a prolonged clawback process that concluded in July 2007, Invest NI  recovered only &pound;5 million of the &pound;15 million that had been spent on it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee was profoundly concerned by how the Valence project was  handled by the IDB. In particular, the Committee was disturbed at the range of  project shortcomings occurring over such an extended period of time.  Well-established procedures designed to protect taxpayers&rsquo; money were  repeatedly ignored, there was a worrying lack of transparency on several  issues, and there were gaps in the documentary records. In addition, the work  of the board casework committee, a key control in the risk management process,  was undermined by the IDB&rsquo;s over-optimistic and ambiguous submission in support  of the project.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The head of the economics branch also said that the  assumptions that were made in the economic viability test were not realistic,  but that was never reviewed.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At several key points, the IDB failed to take the  opportunity to either renegotiate its offer or withdraw from the project and  invoke clawback, even when the evidence pointed overwhelmingly towards the need  to do so. Instead, the IDB gave in to the company&rsquo;s demands and failed to take  the hard decisions when required. Therefore, it is not surprising that, in the  final analysis, the project represented a very poor return on taxpayers&rsquo; money.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At project appraisal, which is a key stage of the support  process, the IDB failed to apply many of the most fundamental elements of its  own guidelines. The evidence clearly shows that corners were cut. For example,  at the time at which the project was assessed, Valence had not even developed a commercial  product and so could not produce a proper business plan, even though no  meaningful appraisal of viability could be carried out without one. It was of  particular concern that the project was scrutinised at the highest level in the  IDB, yet despite the many warning signs, it was still recommended for  assistance. That suggests that, institutionally, a blind eye was turned towards  the very obvious limitations of the project. The Committee found that to be a disturbing  insight into the management culture at that time.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Over the nine-year period to 2003, there were several  critical points at which the IDB should have called a halt to the project to  reappraise it and, if necessary, either renegotiate the contract or terminate  it. However, on each occasion, the IDB failed to do so and continued to provide  funding. Our Committee recognises that calling a halt to a major project is a  difficult step and one that requires careful judgement. Nevertheless, it seems  staggering that, for so long, the IDB maintained an almost blind faith in a  project that was obviously in a great deal of trouble. The Committee was  disappointed to learn that only around one quarter of the Valence workforce came from areas and  backgrounds of economic and social disadvantage. The Committee agreed that  Invest NI must do much more to ensure that people from disadvantaged areas have  an opportunity to benefit from its inward investment programme.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Before Valence,  there were other high-profile inward investment failures, including DeLorean  and Lear Fan. The Committee was extremely disappointed that the IDB blatantly  disregarded lessons from those cases in its handling of the Valence project. Despite those criticisms,  the Committee wishes to make it clear that it does not want Invest NI to be a  risk-averse organisation. It is a question of balance. The Committee supports  risk taking, but only where it is properly assessed and effectively managed.  Supporting industrial development is a risky business, and good judgement has  to be exercised. Some projects are likely to fail. However, the appraisal  guidelines and past experience are key elements of the risk assessment and  management process and must never be ignored or sidestepped. The Department has  given an assurance that lessons have been learned, and that is crucial if  Invest NI is to earn the confidence of elected representatives.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am aware that I am running out of time. I will wrap up my  remarks very shortly, but I want to mention the Committee&rsquo;s &lsquo;Report on the  Investigation of Suspected Contract Fraud&rsquo;. That report really resonated with  me, given that some libraries in my constituency have now closed because some  of the necessary work was not carried out. Public money for the upkeep of  public libraries is scarce. In fact, many libraries have closed. As I said,  some in my area have closed, and parts of east Belfast were particularly hit by some of the  library closures. Libraries are a wonderful resource for the young and old and  for the new people who come to live in our society. However, the value of  libraries to the community was lost completely in the culture that had grown up  in the Belfast Education and Library Board. Money was paid out to keep the  buildings in good repair, but the repairs were not done or were done  dangerously. The Audit Office report even reproduced photographs of the work to  show how shoddy it was.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The officials who were supposed to safeguard the public  interest by securing good contractors competitively and by monitoring their  performance instead selected contractors from a favoured few and routinely paid  for work without checking that it had been done in the first place. I found it  staggering that so many of the problems that arose could have been very simply  avoided and were due to the failure to take the most basic good practice  measures. No finding of fraud was made in that case. However, as in the Valence case, the culture  of the organisation was alarming. Leaders must ensure that an ethos of  responsibility for taxpayers&rsquo; money is shared throughout public sector  organisations. Whistle blowers were ignored, procedures to address conflicts of  interest were not followed, basic checks and supervision were not carried out,  and duties were not segregated to prevent the opportunity for fraud. A  LeasCheann Comhairle, I will leave it there, because I know that other  Committee members wish to speak.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McQuillan</strong>:  As a member of the Public Accounts Committee, I will speak on the report on  North/South bodies, which was completed on 17 June 2010. I point out that I was  not a member of the Committee until September 2010.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This was the first time that the Committee looked into how  the North/South bodies operated. North/South bodies are engaged in a range of  areas including tourism, trade and development, food safety, the promotion of  Irish and Ulster Scots, and the administration of EU funds. Their activities  are funded jointly in varying proportions by the Northern Ireland Assembly and  the Irish Parliament.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Areas of interest overlap between Departments here and in  the Republic. The Committee decided to take oral evidence regarding the unique  financial accounting and reporting arrangements of the bodies. The Committee  made a useful first contact with North/South bodies at the InterTradeIreland  premises in Newry on 12 March 2009. InterTradeIreland and the Special EU  Programmes Body (SEUPB) gave evidence to the Committee, which examined the  financial accounting and reporting arrangements and issues of general  application to all North/South bodies.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Owing to the overlap between Northern Ireland and the Republic,  the Committee&rsquo;s work was co-ordinated with work carried out by the Irish  Parliament. The counterpart Public Accounts Committee of the Irish Parliament  took evidence from Waterways Ireland, the Food Safety Promotion Board and  Tourism Ireland.  The Committees met in Dublin  to discuss the bodies&rsquo; financial governance systems and overall accountability  in North/South bodies. The report of the Public Accounts Committee to the  Assembly made important recommendations on promoting accountability and good  governance in those bodies. The Committee wants to make sure that North/South  bodies keep up with standards of best practice.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In these difficult economic times, the Committee examined  whether InterTradeIreland was working effectively with the other development  agencies. The Committee was determined to ensure that there was no wasteful  duplication of effort and that resources were concentrated on schemes with the  best payback.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee went on to scrutinise how the Special EU  Programmes Body operates in its important but complex and highly regulated  field. The Committee wanted to make sure that every attempt was being made to  streamline structures further without compromising accountability. The Committee  looked at the support arrangements to help community groups frame high-quality  proposals that would be accepted. The Committee found that only 52% of  applications for EU funding under Peace II were successful, which indicated  that 48% of applications by community groups and others were fruitless. The  Committee emphasised that SEUPB should exercise strict quality control over  consultations and frame its contracts to enforce rigorous quality standards.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The report was agreed by the Committee in June 2009 and launched  on 17 June 2010, following consultation with the Irish Parliament. The reports  of both Committees were published separately at that time and can be read  together to provide a full analysis of the bodies. All eight of the  recommendations in the Committee&rsquo;s report were accepted by the Government in  their memorandum of reply on 13 September 2010.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Speaking as a Member of this House, I believe that there is  significant wastage in the North/South bodies. It is clear from the report that  savings can be made in administration. With reference to the Special EU  Programmes Body, it was projected that administrative savings of &pound;1&middot;4 million  could be made over seven years. During these tough economic times, particularly  considering the comprehensive spending review, Committee members must decide  whether it would be better to spend money currently invested in North/South  bodies on our Health Service, schools and social housing. The report also  referred to overlap between InterTradeIreland and other investment bodies such  as Invest NI. We must keep tabs on that to ensure that efficiencies are made  and accountability is maintained.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  will reflect on a particularly busy year for the Public Accounts Committee,  which has meet weekly and, as can be seen from the motion, has produced 15  reports. Over that period, there has been a change of style in our reports;  they are generally shorter, and, in an effort to create an efficient format for  ourselves, we have introduced key recommendations. Each report includes records  of evidence sessions in which permanent secretaries and key senior civil  servants were held to account for their expenditure of public funds, on issues  that were highlighted as questionable in the audit process and on which lessons  needed to be learnt and, on occasion, on instances of good practice when it was  thought worthwhile to share experience so that others might benefit.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Members will have noted in the latter part of the  motion, a memorandum of reply is part of the process. That is when the departmental  response comes back to the Committee and we determine whether our  recommendations have been addressed satisfactorily and, on occasion, go back to  issues about which we have concerns. Therefore it reflects a considerable body  of work, and I put on record my thanks to the staff of the Public Accounts  Committee and, indeed, the Northern Ireland Audit Office for their support in  the process.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I shall concentrate first on the pre-school education  expansion programme. I declare an interest as a governor of Glen Primary School  and as a committee member of Horizon Sure Start, which assists parents of  children in the nought-to-four age group in parts of Larne and Carrickfergus.  The Department of Education recognises that effective pre-school education  helps children&rsquo;s personal and social development, ensuring that they come to  primary school ready to learn because they have appropriate cognitive and social  skills. That was the basis of the pre-school education programme that commenced  in 1998.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee acknowledges that there has been great  progress in increasing the benefits from and access to pre-school education.  However, we concluded that geographical gaps in supply and demand still need to  be tackled, although we must reflect the challenges due to population shifts.  Nevertheless, for several years, a number of my East   Antrim constituents&rsquo; children failed to be offered pre-school  places in their immediate pre-school year. I am sure that other Members have  been contacted about the same matter, so that issue needs to be addressed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Another key recommendation was that the Department identify  where and why parents do not avail of pre-school education, particularly in  disadvantaged areas, where taking up such places produces the maximum benefit  to children&rsquo;s education. Recommendation 2 also expressed concern that the  curriculum needs to be age-appropriate in order to meet the needs of all  pre-school children. In particular, we recommended that the Department consider  carefully the findings of the report on the Sure Start curriculum from the  inspectorate, which may already be out.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I note from the reply to an Assembly question that 1,202  children failed to get into pre-school in their immediate pre-school year.  Subsequently, the Minister produced additional money, although that did not  solve all the problems, so I await information on those who were unsuccessful.  Due to a legal loophole in the programme, the Department spent &pound;10 million to  provide 1,500 pre-school places for two-year-olds, many of whom do not benefit  fully when they mix with older children. Indeed, trying to educate and work  with such an age range creates difficulties for staff, so spending money on  such places produces relatively poor outcomes. That issue still has to be  resolved. There are also questions about the quality of education in some  reception classes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Another area in which I am particularly interested is the  need to manage effectively personal injury claims due to potholes or holes in  footpaths. Effective information gathering and managing that information are  key aspects of ensuring that an accurate record is kept of what has been done  to address the issue and of when inspections have been carried out. Public  funds are limited, so we must ensure that they are not spent purely on compensation.  If there is a fault, that is what should happen, but it would be much better if  the situation were managed and repairs were carried out in a timely fashion so  that people were not injured in the first place.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Recommendation 3 of that report was interesting. The  Committee indicated that there should be a flexible approach to what is  regarded as an actionable defect. I was able to give a classic example from  Larne, in my constituency, from where I was receiving regular complaints from  people who were tripping on a particular manhole. The manhole was sitting at  just below the required 20 mm level, so nobody was doing anything about it, but  people were still tripping. It is important that faults such as that, in a busy  town centre area, are repaired, otherwise someone will be injured, and further  costs to the public sector &mdash; in the Health Service, for example &mdash; will be  incurred. I am pleased that that recommendation has been accepted.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The high legal costs of claims processes are an issue, as  are the high compensation levels. Those lead to high insurance costs to pay for  them, which causes particular difficulties for younger drivers. I am pleased  that those issues were picked up by the Committee in recommendations 4 and 5 in  the report.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:  The Member must bring his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  identified the fact that those who set legal fees seem, largely, to be from the  legal profession. I am pleased that the Justice Minister has taken forward that  issue, and I hope that legal costs will come down.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>:  The motion covers a wide range of government services, many more than would  have been dealt with when we were under direct rule and the work was done at Westminster. That is  good, and I want to record my thanks to the Comptroller and Auditor General and  his staff for the excellent working relationship that the PAC has with them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is very encouraging to have a comprehensive report that  deals with so many issues. I am sure that the Minister of Finance and Personnel  will agree that every penny of public money should be traced from its source to  where it is spent. Of course, fraud in public services is shocking, but there  are many other ways to squander public money, provide a bad service and cheat  the most vulnerable people out of their rights. That is not acceptable in any  democracy that wants to hold its head high along with other European nations  that are striving to eliminate fraud, corruption, waste and bad practice  wherever they rear their ugly heads.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are times when Departments, their agencies and  arm&rsquo;s-length bodies get tetchy when they are subject to criticism. We have had  the occasional allegation that the Public Accounts Committee has strayed into  policy areas, but, when its accusers are challenged to point out where, very  poor evidence is offered. My plea to every Member &mdash; I note that we have 15  present &mdash; is to fully support the work of the Public Accounts Committee. All  108 of us rise or fall on the same tide of endeavour to achieve the best  possible government and related services at the smallest cost to the taxpayers.  It is as simple as that; Micawber had it all. By and large, that is happening,  and it is good.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Let me make it clear: nowhere in those reports has the  Public Accounts Committee set out to damn any Department where that is  unjustified. On the contrary, the PAC has praised good government work where  there is evidence of that and will continue to do so. However, there will be no  let-up in our determination to eliminate fraud, shoddy service and poor delivery  of objectives. The report on the investigation of suspected contract fraud  illustrates some of the worst practices, which allowed a contractor to be paid  for work that he never did. What sort of example is that for other contractors  who continually complain that they never have the opportunity to get involved  in government contract work? Does that not make a complete mockery of the  public procurement process from beginning to end? I am sure that you agree with  that, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to touch on the report on the performance of the  Planning Service. That report is shocking by any comparison, and it helps to  explain the low level of confidence in the Planning Service, which has been a  problem. However, at least the causes have been identified, and, hopefully, the  appropriate steps agreed are being taken to ensure that the public are treated  how they expect to be treated, enforcements are followed through and the  service is never again described as not fit for purpose. That is what the  public want, and the vast majority of dedicated people in the Planning Service  undoubtedly want that too. If the Planning Service does not promote good  planning laws and fails to ensure that those laws are respected and not abused  by speculators and developers, our environment suffers irreparable damage that  future generations have to live with. Many will claim that it has been a  free-for-all that has been full of corruption and abuse, and people will  willingly highlight where that has happened, not only in Belfast but across the North.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Perhaps the most shocking report under consideration is  that on the resettlement of long-stay patients from learning disability  hospitals. Where in the world would you have people institutionalised for 30  years or more when there is no good reason to do so other than a failure to  provide the proper community support that is needed to repatriate those people  in the community? That is a shocking indictment of society, and no argument  about funding can in any way justify keeping people in institutions for the  best part of their life. Let me make it clear that I am in no way suggesting  that patients are not well cared for. Of course they are; I saw that for myself  when I visited Muckamore   Abbey Hospital.  It is their choice and right to be rehabilitated into the community, but there  has been a wholesale failure to grant them one of the most basic and  fundamental human rights of all, namely the right to freedom. In the past week,  an answer to a question from my colleague Thomas Burns disclosed that some of  the worst criminal elements serve very few years in jail, if they go to jail at  all. Yet the innocent are locked up for 30 years or more without having  committed a crime. What a shame.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Let me make it clear that, where standards of performance  fall below the agreed levels, those in senior positions of responsibility are  held fully accountable and have to justify their good salaries and, indeed,  their jobs. The practice of switching accounting officers to another Department  just before the Public Accounts Committee decides to have a public hearing must  end, and those who have been moved should be asked to come back to account for  their stewardship. I am confident that the PAC will demand that in the future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the future, it may be necessary for the Assembly to  increase the PAC&rsquo;s powers to ensure that earlier intervention is possible and  that greater resources are available to investigate bad practice. The reports  represent important work by the Public Accounts Committee and serve as a  reminder of the need to scrutinise every penny of public money that flows  through government Departments and their agencies. That is particularly true at  this time, when there is an urgency to uncover savings, eliminate waste and  ensure best practice everywhere.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I began by thanking the Audit Office, and I will end by  thanking the staff of the Public Accounts Committee, who have been outstanding  in their support to the Committee.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: I  will speak on the report and the investigation into suspected contract fraud,  which the Chairman and Mr Dallat have already touched on. The Committee  examined the failure of the Belfast Education and Library Board to recognise  the extent to which it was vulnerable to fraud of that kind and its slowness to  act in the face of growing evidence of malpractice. The Committee warned that  the Belfast Board was not unique in that, and, given the evidence now emerging  from the Housing Executive and other public bodies, we may, unfortunately, have  been proved right.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a &pound;200 million maintenance backlog in our schools,  and, in the current economic circumstances, it is essential that the limited  funds that are available are spent for the benefit of children and do not find  their way into the pockets of corrupt contractors and officials. The Committee  found evidence of a long-standing culture in the board&rsquo;s property services unit  that favoured certain contractors and had no regard for proper procurement  procedures.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We noted a wide range of examples of alarmingly poor value  for money. For example, as the Chairman said, the Belfast Board paid &pound;80,000  for work to improve disability access at Whitewell and Oldpark libraries, and  the work never started. On investigation, it was found that a further &pound;110,000  had been paid for similar work at 14 other libraries and that that work was  either incomplete or not to the required standard. The work at Whiterock  library was so poor that it created a health and safety hazard and may well  have damaged the structure of the building.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee considered that the key to improving value  for money in procurement and safeguarding against fraud is to ensure that there  is genuine competition between contractors and that contracts are awarded  fairly. We spent some time on that in yesterday&rsquo;s debate on external consultants.  It is also important that any whistle-blower concerns about suspected  wrongdoing are investigated thoroughly and quickly. The Belfast Board has  failed to investigate properly whistle-blower allegations of price fixing and  collusion in schools maintenance expenditure. It has also failed to take  effective action, even when its own internal auditors raised concerns about how  maintenance contracts were awarded.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee found that the Belfast Board had good  procedures for dealing with conflicts of interest, but those were ignored. As a  result, we found that one board maintenance officer put &pound;64,000 worth of  maintenance work to a firm owned by a member of his family, despite senior  management being aware of the connection. Another maintenance officer accepted  a four-day trip to Italy  from a contractor. That was presented as work-related, and, in the Committee&rsquo;s  view, it was no such thing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee was particularly shocked to discover the  absence of proper procurement procedures, given that the Belfast Board is an  accredited centre of procurement expertise and has been since 2002. The Housing  Executive and Northern Ireland Water both have that status. The Committee  considered that the public would have drawn confidence from the award of COPE  status, and it is vital that the assessment of that status is independent and  rigorous. If the concept of centre of procurement expertise is to mean  anything, we want COPEs that demonstrate persistent poor practice to have their  status removed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A number of Belfast Board maintenance staff were  disciplined as a result of the cases that the Committee examined. The  Committee&rsquo;s view was that the penalties that were imposed were too light and  amounted to nothing more than a slap on the wrist. If I remember correctly, one  of the penalties was the insertion of a letter in the staff file for 18 months,  after which time it had to be taken out and ignored.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee praised the work of the Department of  Education in commissioning and overseeing an independent investigation into the  board&rsquo;s maintenance unit. We were also encouraged by the fact that the  Department had sought to learn lessons from its performance in this case and to  reflect those in its procedures.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The problems that the Committee found with the Belfast  Board stemmed from a long-standing culture that placed little emphasis on  achieving value for money. In such cases, fixing the problem is not only about  improving procedures but about addressing the underlying culture. The Committee  recommended and DFP has accepted that management must ensure that staff are  alert to the need to challenge any instances of poor value for money and are  encouraged and empowered to do so. In the Committee&rsquo;s view, the key to  addressing such cultural problems is leadership to drive up standards, good  supervisory management and appropriate disciplinary action when failures occur.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At the time, the annual procurement spend by government in Northern Ireland  was &pound;2&middot;2 billion. I am not sure what it will be next year, but, if even a small  proportion of that spend is fraudulent, significant sums of public money are  being lost. I believe that the Belfast Education and Library Board has learned  a lesson from the episode and that it has not so much tightened its procedures  as taken steps to ensure that they are adhered to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The PAC returns regularly to instances of bad practice,  malpractice and fraud. Indeed, only yesterday, we debated the subject of  external consultants. The use of external consultants is not a sin in itself,  but the PAC report of 2007 flagged up flagrant disregard of procurement  procedures. That resulted in the doubling of the costs, and, yesterday, a  number of Members expressed their misgivings about the relationship between  Departments and external companies. The report on the Belfast Education and  Library Board highlights the same thing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The PAC has had a useful and productive year. We were  prompted initially by the excellent reports of the Northern Ireland Audit  Office, which is now under the new management of Kieran Donnelly, who has  maintained the high standards set by his predecessor, Mr John Dowdall.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">We have continued to expose wasteful and lax  procedures and have stressed the need for balance and the necessity not to  stifle initiative and, where appropriate, job creation, as in the case of  Invest Northern Ireland.  I have enjoyed my three and a half years as a member of the PAC, which has been  largely harmonious and non-partisan, and I look forward to the rest of the  term. Like other Members, I express my thanks to the staff who have looked  after us expertly and diligently.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">6.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Comptroller and  Auditor General and the Audit Office team, which is a dedicated, diligent and  expert group that performs a remarkable task. I also thank my colleagues who  sit on the Public Accounts Committee, which is very productive. Some 15 reports  are being considered today, but that is by no means the full volume of work  that the Committee has addressed in this term. I join others in expressing my  sincere appreciation of the secretariat, because the quality of its  preparations for the various investigations and evidence sessions that are held  here is reflected in the efficiency and effectiveness of the Committee&rsquo;s work.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to address the resettlement of long-stay patients  from learning disability hospitals, which has already been referred to during  today&rsquo;s discussions, because it is an issue that is close to my heart. I have  no family connections to the issue; rather, I was drawn to it because, as a  public representative in the council and the Assembly, I saw the profound love,  devotion and commitment that people have in dealing with what, at times, appear  to be insuperable challenges and how they have risen to those challenges. That  has been a very inspiring experience. However, it was difficult for those  people to see individuals at an institutional level not being as successful as  they were entitled to expect them to be. It was also difficult for them to see  people with an administrative or clinical responsibility not realising the  aspirations that they had set for themselves.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The term &ldquo;learning disability&rdquo; describes a lifelong  condition, arising before the age of 18, which significantly reduces an  individual&rsquo;s ability to learn new skills, to understand new or complex  information and to live independently. Across the North, a significant figure  of 16,400 individuals &mdash; 1% of the population &mdash; have a learning disability, and  more than a quarter of those people have severe or profound learning  difficulties.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Historically, when individuals with learning disabilities  were unable to remain at home &mdash; there may have been a variety of reasons for  that crisis &mdash; they were offered accommodation and care in long-stay hospitals.  In 1995, the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety took a  policy decision to offer all long-stay patients at the three remaining learning  disability hospitals &mdash; Muckamore Abbey, Longstone and Lakeview &mdash; a better life  through resettlement in the community. That reference to a better life has  given rise to one of the principles applied in the criteria of betterment, and  the option of resettlement must pass that test.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department&rsquo;s initial target was to resettle all  long-stay patients by 2002. However, the Department failed to achieve that, as  was demonstrated in the evidence that was presented and reflected in our  report. Although the number of patients in long-stay hospitals halved in the  period up to 2002 &mdash; we should acknowledge the effort that was involved in  achieving that &mdash; the Department has failed to maintain that momentum or to  allocate sufficient funding to deliver the strategy. A strategy without the  necessary resource is not a strategy, and that term should, therefore, not be  used. A strategy has to be an achievable objective that is properly  thought-out, planned and resourced.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">By 2009, over 250 long-stay patients remained in learning  disability hospitals. The latest target that we have been informed of is full  resettlement by 2013. Therefore, I think that we are entitled to be concerned  that there will continue to be slippage in pursuing that strategic objective.  The evidence suggests that careful attention must be paid to the terms of  resettlement and that we must ask whether we are meeting, in all circumstances,  the best clinical needs and pursuing the principle of betterment. The failure  to resettle those who have been assessed as fit to be discharged and are  willing to leave hospital is unacceptable, but the statistics persist. However,  any departure from the best standards is also unacceptable.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We will all have come upon cases of patients who finished  their treatment, for example, five years ago. Five years after all treatment  has ceased, those patients are still residing in long-stay disability  hospitals. That is a clear failure to deliver policy, and it should be dealt  with. From personal experience, I know of other examples in which people have  been settled in old people&rsquo;s homes, even though they were not in that age  bracket. I question whether anyone would consider that to be betterment. Is an  old people&rsquo;s home really the best environment to send someone from a long-stay  or learning disability hospital, given that such an environment could turn out  to be detrimental in the long term? That particular example was a failure of  resettlement, which does not always succeed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In spite of that, I caution against being afraid of  failure. In this matter, we have to be brave, imaginative and at all times seek  to achieve the best clinical outcomes for all.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member should bring his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  The Committee came to the clear view that those targets require detailed  planning and resources. I urge the Department to bring forward that strong  commitment to demonstrate that it will put aside resources to achieve those  objectives. I do not think that it has done that up to now.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. As  it has for all other members of the Public Accounts Committee, this year has  been a learning curve for me. Along with the Civil Service &mdash; I will come to it  in a moment &mdash; and the Comptroller and Auditor General, I have learned lessons  through the Committee. As my colleague Mr Dallat said, we usually witness the  regular pattern of accounting officers being shifted before the principal  offenders can come before the Committee. We see the usual things, such as poor  management and, usually, overspending. We see a Civil Service characterised as  a body in which reasons are given for not doing things.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Lunn referred to the centre of procurement excellence,  in which, to my mind, a clear conflict of interest was manifest when a private  company, PWC, assessed an agency of government, Northern Ireland Water, even  though that private company was one of the agency&rsquo;s best customers. Another  example is Translink. To me and without getting into whether the agency in  question delivers procurement excellence, that is not a good way to achieve  centre of procurement excellence status. Therefore, there are lessons for us  all.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Having been a member of the PAC this year, I have one  fundamental thing to say: the credibility and standing of the Civil Service has  to be rescued by the clear actions of the head of the Civil Service. At certain  senior levels, the integrity of its work has been brought into serious question,  as was highlighted by the NI Water debacle and the issues with DRD. Public  confidence can be restored in the senior management of the Civil Service only  if the head of the Civil Service, whoever that might be, takes clear,  transparent and effective action.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The past year has been a learning curve for me, and  scepticism has been raised about the actions of senior civil servants that I  have never witnessed before nor could have believed possible in the Assembly in  times of devolution. However, one could argue that, had it not been for  devolution, those antics &mdash; at least those that have been discovered so far &mdash;  would not have been uncovered. It would have been easy for those senior civil  servants to fly to London, sit in front of a few Tory and Labour MPs, give them  the spin and jump on a flight back home and forget all about it. Therefore, one  positive is that accountable democracy has shone the spotlight on those  nefarious black areas on which it needed to be shone.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Moving on, the Committee report that I want to speak about  is on the performance of the Health Service. I found that inquiry detailed and  interesting because it related to the most significant area of expenditure in  the North and to the service that is most significant to my constituents. During  the evidence sessions, I focused on the effectiveness of the service provided  to patients requiring ambulances because that impacts urgently on people who  are at their most vulnerable. I must place it on record that the local effect  of the closure of the A&amp;E department at the Mid-Ulster Hospital  and the lack of ambulance provision in that area has not been properly and  adequately addressed. That gives me great concern as a representative of a  constituency that the Deputy Speaker and I share, and I am sure that he would  join me in those concerns.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I followed a line of questioning to try to gauge the  effectiveness of the Health Service response to the heartbreaking rise in  suicide rates in the North, particularly among our young adults. Again, that  relates to issues close to the area that I represent, and I note that there has  been a further outbreak of suicides in the Chairperson&rsquo;s constituency, which is  a sad loss to us all as a community and a society. It is a difficult issue to  deal with, and I hope that, as a result of what we do here today, we will be  able to put some resources in place for those who are at the end of a very dark  tunnel to help to bring them back from the brink.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also raised an issue that was raised during a previous  evidence session on a report by the RQIA. That issue seems inexplicable and  unacceptable in this day and age. I refer to the standards of cleanliness  required to make hospitals a safe place to go for treatment, rather than a  refuge for devastating infections. It is awful to think that people who should  be going into hospital to get better go into hospital and get sick. That is  incredible, particularly for older people who are at their most vulnerable and  weak.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Overall, the Committee considers that there is much about  the Northern Ireland Health Service that is very positive. Key achievements highlighted  by the Committee include a reduction in patient waiting times in both primary  and secondary care; falling death rates from big killers such as cancer and  heart disease; improved life expectancy; decreasing levels of smoking; falling  rates of teenage pregnancy; and lower levels of hospital-acquired infection in  some areas. However, the Committee concluded that some areas of concern remain.  Although overall measures of life expectancy are heading in the right  direction, inequalities in health status between those in the more affluent and  most disadvantaged parts of the North persist. In addition, obesity remains a  major concern that is storing up health problems for the future. Furthermore,  suicide reduction targets are becoming increasingly difficult to meet, and poor  hospital hygiene persists in some trusts.</p>

    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Member to draw his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  There are some big questions for us and for society about how to improve health  equality for people of all socio-economic groups, guarantee Health Service  funding, prevent slippage and creatively enable the service&rsquo;s skilled and  dedicated personnel to continue their good work.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Purvis</strong>: I  wish to associate myself with the remarks that were made about the Comptroller  and Auditor General, the Audit Office and, indeed, the Committee Clerk and  Committee staff, who all worked with great professionalism over the past year.  I will address the Committee&rsquo;s &lsquo;Report on the Management of Social Housing Rent  Collection and Arrears&rsquo;, a subject that is all the more topical given the  recent Budget announcement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Housing Executive and housing associations are  responsible for collecting some &pound;350 million of rental income a year. Failure  to maximise that income has serious implications for their ability to carry out  property maintenance and provide other services to around 115,000 tenants. The  Committee recommended that the Housing Executive review its arrears-prevention  activities in line with best practice to assist its tenants in avoiding debt.  We welcome the Housing Executive&rsquo;s subsequent introduction of specialist staff,  who were trained by Citizens Advice to advise tenants on managing their  finances, and of a long-overdue facility to allow them to pay online by direct  debit in addition to existing payment methods.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The social housing tenant population is characterised by  high levels of financial vulnerability. Around 70% of the Housing Executive&rsquo;s  rental income is derived from housing benefit. The Committee considered the  Housing Executive&rsquo;s slow rate of processing housing benefit claims to be  alarming, given the obvious potential for that to create or increase debt for  individual tenants. The Committee recommended that the Housing Executive should  subject the ongoing improvements being made to its processing of benefits,  which include a new IT system and a more holistic approach to assessing overall  benefit eligibility, to a formal review to ensure the delivery of sustained  performance improvements.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Deficiencies in the accounting systems that were used to  record housing benefit overpayment before 2004 meant that the Housing Executive  could not determine how much of the arrears, either in total or in individual  cases, was true rent arrears and how much was housing benefit overpayment.  However, the Housing Executive stated that 32 high-value arrears cases, each  owing more than &pound;10,000, related either to benefit fraud or error. The  Committee found it unacceptable that those and other large debts were allowed  to accumulate without the Housing Executive having acted sooner to recover  them. We recommended that the Housing Executive routinely produce an aged  debtor profile to assist it in identifying the nature of the arrears problem  and targeting recovery action more effectively. That recommendation was  accepted, and the Housing Executive has reorganised its debt management service  with the aim of improving efficiency.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The high levels of arrears in individual cases tied in with  the findings of the Housing Executive&rsquo;s own inspectors, who reported many  examples of poor compliance with rent procedures by staff at local offices.  Information provided to the Committee showed that that was an ongoing problem.  The Committee concluded that the Housing Executive had not been successful in  ensuring that staff understood and applied arrears procedures correctly. The  Committee recommended, therefore, that senior management should regularly  review the communication of policies and related staff training, as well as  ensuring that the inspection regime is designed to identify problems quickly.  That recommendation was accepted, and the Housing Executive introduced revised  performance review and inspection regimes from January 2010.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Despite its fundamental importance, only one of the Housing  Executive&rsquo;s corporate targets related to rent collection. It simply required  that arrears should not deteriorate year on year. The Committee considered that  that was not a meaningful measure of performance and was capable of  manipulation. Indeed, without high levels of arrears write-off, the Housing  Executive would have failed to meet the target for several years in succession.  Furthermore, measurement of performance against a broader range of indicators  revealed other concerns, including shortfalls in rent collection, a high  proportion of former tenant arrears and a large number of high-value individual  arrears cases. The Committee recommended the establishment of new and more  comprehensive targets and performance indicators for rent arrears, against which  future performance can be measured and reported. Fortunately, that  recommendation was also accepted.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Housing Executive regularly benchmarks its performance  against that of other housing organisations in HouseMark, which is a large  benchmarking group. Although it performed well in recent years when compared  with that group, the Committee was concerned that its performance was less  encouraging when compared with a group comprising all the English local  authorities. Despite the Housing Executive&rsquo;s assurances that it compared its  performance with that group as well as with HouseMark members, the Committee  saw little point in that exercise, since its results were not reported.  Therefore, the Committee recommended that the Housing Executive establish a formal  benchmarking strategy, identifying actions required in relation to performance  and process benchmarking. That recommendation was accepted.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Until comparatively recently, the Department for Social  Development did not give sufficient priority to oversight and scrutiny of  housing associations&rsquo; rental income and arrears management performance. For  example, the Department&rsquo;s internal checking procedures had failed to detect  deficiencies in the information supplied by associations, including incomplete  or missing returns and incorrect data transcription. Given that associations  are a growing proportion of the social housing sector, the Committee  recommended that the Department subject its regulatory framework for  associations to regular review. Those reviews should identify areas for  improvement and be used to adapt the framework in light of evolving risks in  that sector. That recommendation was accepted, and amendments have been  implemented to the framework and to checks on data received from associations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The report is comprehensive and contains practical  recommendations that should ensure good value for money for the public by  improving the management of social housing, rent collection and arrears for  tenants and social housing providers alike.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for the Environment (Mr Boylan)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a  LeasCheann Comhairle. I did not know that you were saving the best until last;  you put me to the back of the class, and I have been waiting around to speak.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am glad to have the opportunity to speak about the  reports, but I want to speak specifically about the Public Accounts Committee  report on the performance of the Planning Service and the DFP memorandum of  reply.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The performance of the Planning Service is an issue that my  Committee has taken a keen interest in over the course of this mandate. We all  know that the Planning Service is capable of making a major contribution to the  North&rsquo;s economy. I do not think that many Members will disagree that an  effective and efficient Planning Service is an integral part of reviving and  maintaining growth in our economy. We also know that, for too long, our  Planning Service has underperformed. We have seen that particularly with regard  to targets for the processing of planning applications and the delivery of a  full suite of planning policy statements.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although improvements have been made in the past few years  in getting to grips with the backlog of applications, I am concerned that the  recent redeployment of Planning Service staff will have a detrimental impact on  workloads and will take us back to the days of lengthy delays in the processing  of applications. The Committee has pressed the Department and the Minister to  produce a financial workload model for the delivery of planning services, and  members remain concerned that the redeployment has occurred without an  appropriate workload model in place. The Planning Service is, as its name  suggests, a service. We cannot simply let a lack of funds dictate the number of  staff, without any indication of how planning services in the North will  continue to be provided. How will businesses and industries respond quickly to  any upturn in the economy if fit-for-purpose planning services are not there to  process new planning applications rapidly and efficiently? Therefore, I  wholeheartedly concur with the report&rsquo;s recommendation that the staffing model  for the delivery of planning services should be completed as a matter of  urgency. I look forward to a chance to scrutinise it with my fellow Environment  Committee members.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The other major concern that the Committee has had with the  Planning Service, which the PAC report also highlights in great detail, is the  issue of the Electronic Planning Information for Citizens system. We all know  that the system was meant to speed up the planning process, but four years  later we still await the full roll-out of the project, which has gone  considerably over budget in that time. The report highlights the project  management failures from the very start and the fact that improvements and  changes were not made despite several interim health checks. Despite all that,  some officials were awarded bonuses amounting to &pound;60,000. That is completely  wrong; we should not reward failure.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased to report that the DOE accepted most of the  recommendations made by the PAC, but I am extremely concerned that, with regard  to the payment of bonuses, the Department defends its management system, saying  that it feels it to be robust. It argues that bonuses are paid on the basis of  output. We have yet to see the e-PIC output, yet rewards have been dished out.  That is totally unacceptable.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Environment Committee was given a brief update on the  project at a meeting in September and has requested a full briefing at the end  of this month. The mistakes in that project must not be allowed to happen  again. Lessons must be learnt, and my Committee will be asking officials what  measures the Department is putting in place to ensure that such a situation  will never happen again.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On behalf of the Environment Committee, I commend the  Public Accounts Committee&rsquo;s report and its recommendations to improve the  performance of the Planning Service. I hope that the Department takes all the  recommendations on board and implements the necessary changes as soon as possible.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel &nbsp;(Mr S Wilson)</strong>:  My notes say that I am delighted to be here to respond to the Public Accounts  Committee debate. Therefore even though it is half past six in a half-empty  Chamber on a Tuesday night, that is what I had better say.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">First, I want to acknowledge the roles played by the  Chairperson of the Committee, Paul Maskey, and the Deputy Chairperson, Roy  Beggs, in providing leadership for the Committee in its work. I also commend  the work of Kieran Donnelly, the Comptroller and Auditor General, and his staff  in the Northern Ireland Audit Office in supporting the Committee.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Strengthening financial management is something that we  should all take seriously. I am sure that you will be interested to know that  my Department is hosting interns from Turkish Ministries and sharing with them  our good practices and the lessons learnt thus far. I commend them for their  tenacity and dedication in sitting through this lengthy debate at this hour,  and I hope that they have a good meal afterwards. However, it is important that  we pass on what lessons we can learn here, and, of course, any lessons that can  be learnt from how others do things are important for us, too.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee, through its recommendations, has sought to  help Departments to improve their financial management and to strengthen  transparency and accountability in our public bodies. Although it is no  surprise, there is no doubt that the recent spending review outcome presents a  serious challenge to the Executive. We all recognise that the strong growth in  public expenditure in recent years cannot continue. On the current side, we  face an 8% reduction in real terms between now and 2014. Given the inflation  and pay pressures that we face, there is no doubt that that will be difficult  to manage. There will be a 40% reduction in capital investment by the end of  this spending period in 2015. Therefore, fewer resources will be available than  was originally envisaged under the investment strategy. That means that the  Executive will have to take difficult decisions about what projects will be  funded. It also means that we have to ensure that services continue to be  delivered as effectively and efficiently as possible. Key to that is improving  our financial management and looking for better ways of doing things. We need,  therefore, to focus seriously on the three Es &mdash; economy, efficiency and  effectiveness &mdash; as we move ahead.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Therefore, it will be essential for us to have a  strong Public Accounts Committee. The focus of the Public Accounts Committee&rsquo;s  recommendations on the three Es will become even more important if we want to  secure the maximum benefit possible for the taxpayer. We must also ensure that  Departments learn lessons from the past; we do not want to see mistakes repeated  and money wasted.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">6.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the Committee&rsquo;s recent decision to publish a  thematic report. It was a very good way of reinforcing the lessons that have  been learnt. When it is accepted, Departments will have a responsibility to  ensure that PAC recommendations are implemented without delay, and it is  understandable that the Committee wishes to have the information that it needs  to satisfy itself that that is happening. However, we must also minimise the  burden on public bodies in our quest for information, because every request for  information requires time and resources that cannot be used for other things.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will address, in chronological order, as many issues that  were raised by Members as possible. Paul Maskey raised the issue of Valence  Technology and the concerns about the amount of money that Invest Northern  Ireland put into the firm, only for the jobs and the firm to disappear from Northern Ireland.  DETI has acknowledged that the former IDB made mistakes in handling that case,  but the important thing is that it has learnt from those mistakes and taken  appropriate action.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I understand that Invest Northern Ireland conducted a  comprehensive review of the shortcomings in that case, and it now considers that  its guidance has been enhanced significantly. With regard to the key areas that  were highlighted in the report, robust procedures are now in place for project  appraisal and for monitoring, and the lessons learned have been incorporated  into Invest Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  internal training programmes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is about getting the balance right all the time, and the  Chairperson made a very important point that when IDB moved into the field of  attracting investment or supporting investment projects, there was always an  element of risk. We have been careful not to become so prescriptive that we  reduce people&rsquo;s willingness to take the risks that are sometimes required.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Paul Maskey and Mr Lunn also raised the issue of suspected  contract fraud in the education and library boards, which affects us all by  robbing us of scarce resources. Therefore, it is encouraging to note that the  Department of Education and all the education and library boards are working to  enhance and to improve their fraud management processes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am advised that all the education and library boards have  introduced new procurement systems, including the development of measured-term  contracts. My Department has issued new guidance on tender-evaluation  procedures; it has reviewed its contract management guidance, and a final draft  will be tabled to the procurement board, which I chair, later this month. We  have sought to learn lessons from that case by highlighting the whistle-blowing  case in the annual fraud report and by discussing it at the Northern Ireland  Civil Service fraud forum.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McQuillan asked about the Committee&rsquo;s report on  North/South bodies. My Department, in conjunction with the Department of  Finance in Dublin,  is undertaking a review of the financial memoranda applied to North/South  bodies to ensure that they remain fit for purpose. That review will address  issues raised by the Committee, including the disclosure of remuneration in  accounts, conflicts of interest and whistle-blowing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to the Special EU Programmes Body, my  Department has undertaken significant work over the past year to enhance and to  streamline arrangements for joint committees administering Peace III moneys.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">DETI has confirmed that it will continue to work with its  counterparts in the Republic to ensure that InterTradeIreland&rsquo;s cash balances  are minimised. I am also pleased to say that a clear timetable has now been  established for the finalisation of the language body&rsquo;s outstanding accounts;  an issue that, I know, has concerned a number of Members.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Beggs raised the issue of the pre-school education  expansion programme. The Committee will be aware that the Department of  Education issued its draft early years strategy for consultation in June 2010.  The consultation process includes issues such as age-appropriate provision,  which Mr Beggs raised; workforce development; quality and effectiveness of  provision; and changes in how special and additional education needs in early  years are addressed. The Department of Education has advised that it is seeking  to match supply and demand for places and that it is working closely with  transfer officers for 2011-12 to ensure that the take-up of places for children  of the correct age is maximised.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although we understand that not every youngster can get  into the particular establishment of their choice, I am sure that Mr Beggs is  as aware as I am that it is unacceptable to ask a parent to take their child to  a facility in another town or for a youngster to be placed in an Irish-language  facility when his or her parents have not expressed that preference. The  Department of Education advises that children from socially disadvantaged  circumstances should be given priority in the pre-school expansion programme.  It has initiated research to identify why an estimated 10% of parents chose not  to avail themselves of free preschool places for their children.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Beggs also raised the issue of the management of  personal injury claims. I am pleased to note that DRD has confirmed that the  adequacy of information that has been provided by its central claims unit now  fulfils all Roads Service requirements. I understand that the Committee raised  concern about locations where there was a high number of claims. DRD has  confirmed that Roads Service will identify the locations where there has been a  high number of claims and where no statutory defence was available and it will  consider whether internal controls need to be altered to ensure that inspection  and maintenance are carried out to the required standard.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Dallat raised the issue of whether some of the reports  that were produced contained policy issues. I raised that point during the  previous debate, mainly because I was concerned when I saw the number of  responses that were going back in which no recommendation had been made. Therefore,  rather than the Committee feeling that issues were simply being dismissed, where  it is a policy issue, that, of course, remains an issue for the Minister and  the Department. I had a useful meeting with the Committee Clerk and the  Chairman to discuss occasions when that has happened. If that helps to avoid  misunderstanding in the future, it was worthwhile. I hope that that was  reported back to the Committee.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Dallat and Mr McLaughlin also referred to long-stay  patients at hospitals for people with learning disabilities. Mr McLaughlin  brought the degree of emotion that can be attached to that very important  issue. The Health Department has confirmed that it is committed to helping  people with learning disabilities to live as independently as possible in the  community. The process of resettling those people remains complex. They cannot  be abandoned; that is important. The Department has said that it will ensure  that patients&rsquo; needs and well-being are at the forefront of the process.  Resettlement is pursued only where it offers betterment for a patient. That is  important. It would be wrong to simply tick a box and say that someone has been  taken out of an institution and resettled and leave that person in conditions  in which he or she feels vulnerable and his or her quality of life is not  appropriate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, resettlement must be clinically appropriate,  clearly meet patients&rsquo; needs, and have the potential to better the lives of  patients. Importantly, DHSSPS has confirmed that no one will be forced to leave  a long-stay hospital against their or their family&rsquo;s wishes. That is important  because that is the other side of the coin. DHSSPS also considers that, with  careful and sympathetic management, resettlement can be successful for all  patients, regardless of the length of time that an individual has spent in  hospital.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Dallat and Mr Boylan raised the performance of the  Planning Service, and the Committee&rsquo;s report on that issue was wide-ranging, comprehensive  and covered a number of important areas, including the infamous IT e-PIC  system. DOE has accepted that certain aspects of that project could have been  handled more effectively, but it has confirmed that robust programme management  arrangements are now in place. I am sure that a careful watch will be kept on  that. Although the full implementation of e-PIC was overdue and over budget,  DOE has confirmed that there have been early releases of elements of the new  system, and the public are getting the benefit of those. I know that the  Ballymena office has now moved over to the new system, and it has proved  beneficial.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In response to the concerns of Committee members on  propriety, I can advise that my Department is in the process of revising the  relevant instructions to ensure that all staff who leave the NICS are aware of  the rules about taking up employment within two years of leaving.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McGlone, who is not &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Bring your remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I will. Mr McGlone is not here, so I do not have to  respond to his comments anyhow. Everybody else went over their allotted time a  bit, so let me just finish.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Ms Purvis raised the issue of social housing rent  collection and arrears. I am pleased to note that DSD&rsquo;s debt management service  has been modernised. It has been relocated across six centres, and the Housing  Executive has implemented several initiatives to improve debt management. There  is some sign of success: the debt has gone down from &pound;14 million to &pound;13&middot;3  million. I will leave it up to the Member to judge whether that is a success.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank all Members who participated in the debate. As I  said, I look forward to the next one, though I hope that it is not at this time  of the evening.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Public Accounts Committee</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann  Comhairle. Hopefully, you will not have to shout at me for speaking for more  than 15 minutes, because I will be finished well before that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It has been a positive debate, and I also thank all Members  who spoke, including those who are not members of the PAC, such as Cathal, who  is Chairperson of the Environment Committee, which made a contribution to what  I believe has been valuable work by the PAC.  In the months ahead, we will be looking at working together on different  issues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The remarks clearly demonstrate the value of work that has  been carried out by the Public Accounts Committee, not just in identifying and  criticising inadequacies in the management of public funds but, perhaps equally  as importantly, in offering positive, considered recommendations and in paving  the way to improve effectiveness.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The debate demonstrated my commitment and that of my  Committee colleagues to rigorously challenging the rare instances when public  funds have not been spent well or wisely. The Committee exercises its role on  behalf of the Assembly, and I welcome the opportunity to present the  Committee&rsquo;s work to it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">You will be glad to hear that I will not go over all the  points that were raised by Members, because the Minister has already covered  them. A wide range of issues was touched upon, including those about the SEUPB,  North/South bodies and health. The PAC has dealt with a number of issues that  relate to the Health Department, which is a massive Department with a lot of  responsibilities. The Committee appreciates the time spent by all the  Departments that gave evidence. John O&rsquo;Dowd, the previous Chairperson of the  PAC, said that we are not involved in blood sports but that we are there to get  things done and to proactively ensure that things work out well for the future,  which is an important message to get across.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">6.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I was glad and interested to hear what the Minister said  today, because his remarks were among the more positive that we have heard in  such situations. We usually have a slightly challenging back-and-forth  discussion. It is early yet; perhaps you want to do that, Sammy.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I would love to do that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  I hope that you do not want to do that, because it is as late for you as it is  for me. Perhaps we have small challenges. John Dallat spoke about stepping over  into policy. Our Committee tried to stay away from that, and John mentioned  that in his comments. We are committed and dedicated to the process of ensuring  value for money and the effective delivery of services. We have taken some  criticism on board. We met the Minister and his Department, and we worked  closely together to make sure that we can get it right. We will make mistakes  from time to time, but we want to make sure that we are getting it right. If we  are levelling criticism at anyone, we also have to accept it. To be bold about  it, we must meet and challenge that. If we think that someone is telling us  something that is wrong, that person should be challenged.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We established a good working relationship with the  Treasury Officer of Accounts, who attends Committee meetings when we are  looking through some of the memorandums of reply. We invite her in the hope  that her attendance will reduce the amount of time that is spent in sending  letters and correspondence back and forth to Departments, when there are issues  related to some of our recommendations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I put on record my thanks to the Comptroller and Auditor  General and the Audit Office, because they do a tremendous job. They assist our  Committee greatly. The Assembly secretariat also does an important job and  keeps us well in place. We have been a very busy Committee. Roy Beggs, the  Deputy Chairperson, pointed out that we produced 15 or more reports. That is  not the only work that we are doing. We meet constantly. In recent times, we  have been meeting twice a week to catch up on other issues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is a tough job for the members of the PAC, and we all  have to do it. The challenge function is not easy. It is crucial to that job  that those who participate in its inquiries have proper regard for the  parliamentary process, the authority of the Committee and the challenge  function of elected representatives on behalf of their constituents. Everyone  in the North has the right to expect the Government to spend public money  efficiently, to manage public assets responsibly and to account truthfully for  those decisions. I do not underestimate the responsibility that civil servants  bear to do that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am glad that the Minister said that many of the  recommendations had been taken on board and implemented. That sets us up well  for the future, because we are in a time of economic uncertainty. We want to  save and to protect front line services and jobs. If the recommendations from  all our reports are taken on board, I hope that there will be more effective  government and delivery and better value for money. That is what we are about.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am glad that the debate has taken place. I hope that the  next debate will not be as late in the evening and that our Turkish visitors  are not fed up with us talking at this time of the night. I thank all those  Members who spoke for their participation. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a  LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>

    <p class="Q3Motion">That the Assembly do now adjourn. &mdash; [Mr Deputy Speaker.]</p>
    <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="f"></a>Adjournment</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Alcohol and Drug Abuse Rehabilitation Services in Upper Bann</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The proposer of the topic will have 15 minutes to speak, and all  other Members who wish to speak will have approximately six minutes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I can assure the House that I will  not be taking 15 minutes, so Members can all rest at ease.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The purpose of the debate is not to reinvent the wheel as  regards drugs and alcohol rehabilitation, nor is it to lambast the Health  Minister, who is present, or other Ministers who have responsibility in the  broader field of drug rehabilitation or the prevention of drug and alcohol  abuse. The purpose of the debate is to highlight the issue of drug and alcohol  abuse in Upper Bann and to commend those from  the community and voluntary sector and the statutory sector who are involved on  a daily basis with those who have succumbed to drugs and alcohol abuse.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I deliberately included alcohol abuse in the title of the  debate because we can become fixated with illegal drug abuse, which is a sexier  headline for the media, but we cannot ignore the fact that alcohol abuse is the  main factor in problems in our society and the cause of many issues in family  homes. Indeed, the most recent census of drug and alcohol treatment, which was  carried out on 1 March 2010 on behalf of the Department of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety, shows that 57% of those in treatment at the time  were there because of alcohol abuse, 22% were there because of drug misuse and  a further 21% were there because of both. That shows that, on 1 March 2010, 78%  of those using rehabilitation services, either residential services or  community care services, were receiving treatment for drug and alcohol abuse.  Therefore, it is important that we factor alcohol into the equation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Of the overall numbers in treatment, the Southern Health  and Social Care Trust had the lowest proportion &mdash; around 13%, or 789  individuals. Of course, that trust covers a much wider area than Upper Bann, but the figures have not been broken down any  further. Perhaps the Minister will be able to make the figures available to  Members.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The figures that I am quoting cover formal treatment, the  minority of which is residential treatment. The majority of people are  receiving treatment through the statutory agencies or the community and  voluntary groups within the community. They are based at home and receive  treatment daily. However, it is much more difficult to assess those people who  are not in formal treatment; those who are accessing support either from family  members or community groups, such as mental health and well-being groups or  suicide prevention groups. Unfortunately, many people who suffer from poor mental  health turn to alcohol or drugs. Sometimes people turn to drugs and alcohol as  a result of other issues, and that then affects their mental health, their  stability and their view of their future well-being, which means that some,  therefore, come into contact with suicide prevention groups.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The other area that I would like to touch upon involves  those who are either directly or indirectly involved in preventing young and  old from turning to alcohol and drugs abuse. There are many activities that may  not be directly set up for that purpose but that do, in fact, turn young and  old away from such abuse. Our youth clubs and youth centres are to the fore in  that work. Community work across a wide range of issues is also to the fore, as  are sporting organisations. Much of that work goes unrecognised, and the people  involved do not seek recognition, but they are ensuring, on a daily and nightly  basis, that people, particularly our young people, have diversionary activities  that keep them from abusing alcohol and drugs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I know that many sporting organisations are involved in  such work, but I am aware of a particular programme that is being run by the  GAA in the Lurgan area. Those running the project are involved not only  indirectly in diversionary tactics but directly in prevention tactics. They are  meeting the young people involved in the clubs and talking to them about drug  and alcohol abuse. Equally as important, they are meeting the parents and  guardians and explaining to them how to broach the subject of drugs and alcohol  abuse with young people, how to approach it in an informed way and how to look  for the signs of drug and alcohol abuse among our young people and in the  broader community. The signs can often go hidden for many months, and young and  old are being damaged constantly while that is the case.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Upper Bann is both urban  and rural, but neither urban nor rural communities have escaped the plague of  substance abuse. Isolated rural communities and villages are faced with the consequences  of alcohol and drug abuse, whether it is visible in the family home or on the  streets and street corners where people drink openly and abuse alcohol. It is  important to stress that people who abuse alcohol and drugs out in the open are  not always young.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Over the summer of 2010, rural and urban communities in Upper Bann were also touched and severely beaten by  mephedrone, which had no regard for class, colour or creed and affected the  community on a wide scale. Many families who never thought that their homes  would be touched by drug abuse had to come forward to seek help. There is no  doubt that the intervention of the community, voluntary and statutory sectors  saved lives in the summer of 2010. They acted immediately and they went in  there and helped people. They helped families and those, young and old, who  were affected by the plague of mephedrone.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That brings me on to the subject of drugs. I said that this  debate is not simply about drugs, but I want to speak about illegal drug  seizures. Upper Bann includes two local council  areas. The figures are hard to break down because parts of the Banbridge  District Council area are included in the Lagan Valley  and South Down constituencies. Drug seizures in the Banbridge District Council  area were up by 6<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; ">&#8729;</span>5%, which  sounds impressive. However, when one looks at the actual figures, the number of  seizures is only up by six. That can be regarded as good, because there may be  fewer drugs in circulation. The opposite side of the coin is that the PSNI may  be failing to intercept drugs. Arrests are up by 21% in the Banbridge area,  but, again, that is only an increase of five arrests.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Craigavon Borough Council area falls completely into the Upper Bann constituency. Drug seizures there are down by  over 100%. I ask whether that is because there are fewer drugs about, or  because the PSNI has failed to intercept them. I must put on record, however,  that there has been a number of major drug seizures in the broader Craigavon  area, especially of mephedrone over the summer of 2010. That has to be welcomed,  and there has been a number of significant arrests in that area as well. The  number of arrests of those suspected of being involved in the illegal drug  trade has also risen in that area.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When I started speaking in this debate, I said that I would  keep to the time limit of 15 minutes and I intend to keep that promise. I also  said that I was not here to lambaste the Minister or his Department, or any  other Minister or Department for that matter. However, that is not a &ldquo;get out  of jail free&rdquo; card. Good work is being done in Upper Bann  by the statutory, community and voluntary sectors, but their resources are  stretched, possibly to breaking point. They got through the summer very well,  despite the upsurge in drugs usage. However, we cannot become complacent or  ignore the work that is going on. I emphasise that we must work to an informed  agenda. That is why I use the figures on alcohol treatment and drugs treatment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When issues reach the media, people tend to jump on the  bandwagon, which is sometimes a funding bandwagon. Some act out of proper  cause. However, we cannot look at an area and say simply that there is a drugs  problem there. I do not know any area where there is a drugs problem but not an  alcohol problem, so we have to deal with both those issues in an informed way.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I commend the work of all those across the community and  voluntary spectrum and in sports who have been involved in drugs and alcohol  rehabilitation work. No doubt they have saved lives, and, not only that, they  have improved the lives of family members who have to work and deal on a daily  basis with people affected by drugs. On that note, I will wind up and allow  others to contribute.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">7.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Moutray</strong>:  I congratulate Mr O&rsquo;Dowd on securing this debate on a very important and timely  issue. I also commend the people among our many churches in Upper   Bann who go out on weekend nights and talk to young people about  alcohol and drugs problems. I am thinking particularly of Seapatrick Parish   Church in Banbridge;  First Presbyterian Church, Edenderry, in Portadown; and the Emmanuel Church in  Lurgan. There are many more across the spectrum that I am not familiar with,  but I congratulate them on the difficult work that they do.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In July, the You, Your Child and Alcohol campaign was  launched in partnership with Craigavon Borough Council&rsquo;s community safety  partnership. Leo Foy, the drug and alcohol co-ordinator with the Public Health  Agency and the southern drugs and alcohol co-ordination team said:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The &lsquo;You, Your Child and Alcohol&rsquo; campaign highlights  the need for parents and carers to be aware of the effect of alcohol on young  people, to be able to talk to them from an informed viewpoint and to lead by  example by adhering themselves to sensible daily and weekly alcohol consumption  guidelines.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That drive is supported by the PSNI, the Northern  Ireland Policing Board, the Northern Ireland Office, the Public Health Agency  and the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety. It is about  prevention as much as about recognising early stages of abuse and is a very  welcome initiative.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Craigavon Borough Council has worked in conjunction with  other agencies on numerous initiatives in recent years. I pay tribute to the  council staff and departments that have shown such determination in that  respect. However, darker and more troubling events have occurred in Upper Bann. Only a few weeks ago, two patients were  assaulted by another patient in Craigavon   Area Hospital.  The assailant had presented at the hospital showing signs of alcohol abuse.  After being admitted, his behaviour deteriorated with the result that two  patients, one of whom was in his 90s, were attacked. My colleague Sydney  Anderson and I recently met hospital staff and senior management to raise our  concerns about that worrying attack.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Such a troubling and potentially serious occurrence  highlights the need for a proper, coherent, integrated approach to the  treatment of dependency and the harm done by the abuse of alcohol and drugs. It  ought to be obvious to everyone, as this is a growing problem with immediate  treatment and long-term rehabilitation aspects, that it must be prioritised. We  should not be surprised that it is a growing problem when we have multinational  supermarkets selling alcohol as a loss-leader &mdash; often cheaper than bottled  water.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not want to get into claim and counterclaim on the  issue. I know that the Health portfolio is far from easy. I also know that a  massive fund of hitherto unknown finances is not going to magically appear and  be made available to the Health Minister, but I have to ask whether  efficiencies can be made to allow for a swifter, more comprehensive, integrated  treatment of this important issue.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  I welcome the opportunity to debate alcohol and drug abuse rehabilitation  services in the Upper Bann area. I have often  expressed my concern about the ticking time bomb that alcohol abuse represents  for the Health Service&rsquo;s budget, quite apart from the terrible human cost.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It was after the open sale of legal highs in my home town  of Lurgan that  I first raised the issue with my colleague the Health Minister. Members will be  aware of the enormous public reaction that followed, ending with the banning of  legal highs. I am still concerned that that ban does not go far enough and that  a real risk remains that cloned substances that are almost the same in chemical  make-up as banned substances but are still technically legal are still out  there, and so the problem remains. The amazing professionalism and dedication  of our healthcare staff helps us to rise above some of those difficulties.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am particularly concerned about the links between drug  and alcohol abuse and youth unemployment and suicide rates. Sadly, there is an  increasing demand from people of all ages for access to addiction services, as  there is an increasing impact from alcohol and drugs on the fabric of our  society. Health professionals tell me that, although there are increases in the  misuse of drugs and other substances, with new drugs emerging, the biggest  single drug of concern remains alcohol as regards availability and impact. All  the evidence shows that the most effective way to combat drug and alcohol  misuse is through effective partnership, working with statutory bodies in  health and social care, the police, criminal justice and so on, and with the  voluntary non-statutory agencies through consistent engagement with  individuals, groups and communities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Upper Bann  constituency is in the area of the Southern Health and Social Care Trust, which  is responsible for delivering mental health services for children and adults,  including access to addiction services. Recent developments in that area have  been progressed through the Department of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety strategy entitled &lsquo;New Strategic Direction for Alcohol and Drugs&rsquo;, which  was launched in May 2006. In response to that strategy, the Public Health  Agency has worked with the southern drugs and alcohol co-ordination team and  the southern area addiction service of the Southern Trust, supported by a broad  range of community alcohol and drugs projects across the Southern Trust area.  That has resulted in the development of an integrated, four-tier alcohol and  drugs support service across the whole of the Southern Trust area. Following a  review of counselling services, a dedicated service for those under the age of  18 has been developed to include counselling, mentoring and guidance support  for young people. That service is currently being delivered by Opportunity  Youth, with four staff employed in the Southern Trust area.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The service for the Upper Bann  area is provided by Opportunity Youth from its offices in Mount Zion House, Edward Street,  Lurgan. Additional specialist posts have also been funded, as well as the  Southern Trust&rsquo;s services, including a child and family care liaison  practitioner in the southern addiction team who specialises in providing more  intensive services to patients with child and family concerns, and two  hospital-based addiction liaison practitioners, who will offer advice and  guidance to patients who are presented for services at Craigavon Area Hospital  or the Daisy Hill Hospital in Newry.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the first 18 months of the operation of the hospital  addiction liaison service, more than 900 people were referred to and assessed  by the addiction liaison practitioners in the Southern Trust area, over 600 of  whom were then referred to addiction services for further treatment. A child  and youth substance misuse practitioner, which is a dedicated post, was also  funded to work with child and youth mental health services in acknowledgement  of the need to improve access to dedicated treatment services for young people  in that area. I hope that we can ring-fence as much of the health budget as  possible to support that important work and to confront and defeat that set of  evils.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Anderson</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  I have finished, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I am grateful to the Minister for attending this evening&rsquo;s debate, and I thank  Mr O&rsquo;Dowd for securing it. Alcohol and drug abuse is not unique to Upper Bann. It is rife not only here in the North but in  most of Western society, particularly on the islands of Ireland and GB.  We seem to have a very poor relationship with alcohol in particular. Recent  publications have suggested that alcohol is a worse drug and has a more  devastating effect than many of those on the illegal market. I am sure that all  of us have seen at first hand the devastation that drug and alcohol addiction  can and does inflict on families, individuals and communities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I worked in health and social care for more than 22 years.  Throughout that time, I worked with people with alcohol and drug abuse and  addiction problems. One of the big changes in the late 80s was the mental  health legislation on admissions. People could no longer be admitted while  inebriated, and that has caused difficulties. It will be interesting to hear  what the Minister has to say about how effective the change in the mental  health legislation since then has been. From a personal perspective, having  worked with some families in which a person was under the influence, had an  alcohol addiction problem and was a danger to themselves and a risk to their  family, I know that, at one stage, we could have got them admitted to hospital,  even though they were still drunk. That is no longer the case. I understand the  rationale that people must want to seek treatment and so on, but the change has  made it difficult, particularly when people are not reasonable and their  ability to rationalise and to see what they are doing as harmful to themselves  is impaired.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That leads me to the work that, as other Members said, is  being done in the community, including the GAA and the churches. I am very  familiar with a lot of the work that the churches have done, and I commend  those involved for it. However, in a survey of 50 people aged between 15 and 18  that Craigavon Community Safety Partnership completed last year, 26% said that  they drank alcohol every day. Their main reasons for drinking alcohol were to  be sociable, to have more fun, to get drunk or because they liked its taste. Of  the teenagers surveyed, 61% said that their parents did not discourage them  from drinking alcohol, and 21% had been in trouble with the police due to  alcohol. Those statistics are very concerning and raise the question of whether  adults realise the physical, emotional and mental impact that alcohol abuse has  &mdash; how alcohol can destroy a person&rsquo;s ability to think coherently, as well as  damaging organs such as the liver. I remember a patient bleeding to death as a  result of alcohol abuse. That individual had a horrendous death. Not many  people are aware of the consequences of long-term, chronic alcoholism.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister may acknowledge that the ages of people  admitted to hospital for alcohol-related reasons are getting lower. Younger  people are being admitted to psychiatric care with a history of alcohol and  drug addiction than would have been seen even 20 years ago. Some in the medical  profession say that today&rsquo;s generation will be the first since the early part of  the twentieth century to die before their parents. That statistic should shock  us all into action.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am aware that the debate is not just about young people.  It is also about older people, and I think that there is an unhealthy  relationship with alcohol. Many people&rsquo;s approach is laissez-faire. Unless  people have personal experience of an alcoholic in their family, they do not  really understand or appreciate the messages that they are giving to their  children and family members. That is because they contain it within their home.  Nowadays, many people drink at home, purchase alcohol from supermarkets and so  on. A huge piece of work needs to be done to create greater awareness.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that the Minister will inform us of the cost to  the Health Service. Other Members have indicated that there is also a cost to  the criminal justice system and the police. Communities suffer. In the past two  years, in Craigavon and Banbridge, up to 5,000 crimes have been reported under  the heading of antisocial behaviour. That is a huge cost, not only in policing  but in the damage done to local communities and individuals. We all see young  people in particular drinking vast amounts. They do not drink to be sociable  but to be what was called &ldquo;paralytic&rdquo; when I was going about, although I  understand that it is now known as being &ldquo;bladdered&rdquo;. Nevertheless, some young  people have that concept of drinking. Therefore, to get to grips with what is a  serious and worrying trend in our society, affecting the community and the  lives of families, there must be not just a response from the Health Minister, although  he could take the lead, but a co-ordinated response across the Executive.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">7.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Anderson</strong>:  Like my party colleague Stephen Moutray, I welcome the opportunity to speak.  Stephen mentioned our recent meeting with senior representatives from Craigavon Area Hospital  in the aftermath of an attack on patients. As he pointed out, one of the  patients who was attacked was over ninety years of age, and the attack came  from another patient. During the meeting, it emerged that, as many of us  already suspected, there has been a significant increase in the number of  people who appear at the hospital&rsquo;s accident and emergency department  displaying symptoms of alcohol and/or drug abuse. Of course, that is not a  factor for Craigavon   Area Hospital  alone to contend with but is common across the Province.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The trade in illegal drugs continues to expand. So, too,  does the number of new so-called legal highs, with a new one appearing as soon  as an existing drug is banned. Indeed, a new drug is often ready to replace  another drug before the latter is banned. That trade is expanding, as is the  availability of cheap alcohol, which Stephen also referred to and which we all  recognise as a real danger and are understandably concerned about. We need to  look at how society should respond to and deal with the trend. A number of  matters need to be kept to the fore: abuse prevention and early education about  the dangers of abuse; the early identification of dependency and abuse; and  immediate, short-term treatment and, indeed, long-term help.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Moutray</strong>:  The Member mentioned various aspects of alcohol abuse, and obviously costs are  incurred when prevention measures are rolled out. Does the Member believe that  the health budget should be ring-fenced, as Sam Gardiner advocated?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member will have an extra minute in which to speak.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Anderson</strong>:  My colleague raises a specific point, and it is a big and very real issue. If  we are to deal with alcohol and drug abuse, the solution will come at great  financial cost. In the past couple of weeks, the previous UUP leader, Sir Reg  Empey, said that, although he hoped that he would get preferential treatment,  the Health Minister could not expect his budget to be ring-fenced. In calling  for money to be ring-fenced, Sam Gardiner is at odds with Sir Reg over the  health budget, but I say to Mr Moutray that Sam Gardiner is the only person who  can answer his question. I certainly cannot answer it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I pay tribute to groups such as the Stauros Foundation,  which has organised groups in Banbridge and Portadown. Again, my colleague and  other Members referred to the good work going on in Upper   Bann. Stephen Moutray touched on the good work being done by the  community safety partnership. Nevertheless, much more work can and should be  done. Although not from Upper Bann, Arthur  Williams, the long-time general director of the Stauros Foundation, has done  tremendous work to deal with alcohol abuse, solvent abuse and legal and illegal  drug abuse.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I too want to pay tribute to the work carried out at Mount  Zion House in Lurgan, which spans far and wide and incorporates all ages and  all sections of our community. It is clear that Upper Bann  is not unique in its scale of addiction and abuse. It is also clear that there  are social issues that need to be addressed. Although it is true that much  excellence can be seen day in, day out, this is a problem that is not simply  going to go away, and long-term strategic action is needed.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>: I  thank Mr O&rsquo;Dowd for securing the debate, which is timely. I declare an interest  as a member of Craigavon Borough Council and as a board member of Adapt, a  drugs awareness project based at Mount Zion House. I am deeply concerned about  where Mr O&rsquo;Dowd is coming from on these issues, as they fall under the remit of  the community safety partnership, which was chaired by one of his party  colleagues last year.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Drugs are the scourge of our society, a cancer that eats  away at the lives of many of our young people, whether it is methadone, LSD,  cannabis or an unhealthy addiction to prescription drugs. I am not on the side  of prohibiting alcohol, but there must be a happy medium. If people want to go  out at the weekend or any other time to drink, they must drink responsibly. The  Health Department has played a pivotal role in getting that message out over  the past number of years. Too many hospital visits in Northern Ireland  are due to the overuse and abuse of drugs and alcohol, all of which serves to  put added pressure on the resources of the Health Service and those who work in  it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We must ensure that there is access to services for those  with addictions to drugs, alcohol or, perhaps, both. Although we accept that  there may be those who, through no fault of their own, manage to escape the  system and slip through the net, we must ensure that remedial plans and  speedier and more adequate provision of services is in place to meet the needs  of those persons.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is an issue about where the drugs come from. Although  I commend the PSNI in Lurgan and Banbridge for their sterling endeavour in  taking drugs off the streets, it is clear that we, in post-conflict Northern Ireland,  have a long way to go. There are those who are firmly connected to groups that  still cannot get away from criminality and still insist on bringing heartache,  misery and pain to people in their communities. Last week&rsquo;s violence in Newtownabbey is an example. It is up to the PSNI and the  Justice Minister to ensure that those who peddle death and destruction via  drugs are met with the full force of the law.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am content with the provisions that the Health Department  has put in place in Upper Bann. As always, I  would like to see more being done, but the Assembly needs to look at the budget  and secure as much funding as possible for the Health Service. I do not care  whether it is ring-fenced or not; all I am concerned about is making the funds  available so that our Minister can carry out his job. Let us not forget that it  was Sinn F&eacute;in, among other parties, which voted to slash the health budget. The  challenge now is to secure as much funding for health as we can in the next few  difficult months. I trust that all parties will be fulsome in their support for  the Health Minister&rsquo;s efforts to attract as much Executive funding as possible  for the Health Service here.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Last weekend I was asked to visit Banbridge. It was not  what might be called a regular visit but was with a number of people to see  what goes on there at the weekend. Mr Moutray mentioned the work that is being  done by the churches. At 1.45 am on Sunday I saw the work being done by those  who engage with young people and some who are not so young. One could not speak  highly enough of the work that those people do. They are aware of the problems  that are out there. No matter who those organisations help and no matter what  age they are, they are somebody&rsquo;s child.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Upper Bann has very  attractive facilities that young people can come to enjoy. Unfortunately,  events at those facilities all happen at the weekend. However, at 2.00 am on  that Sunday in Banbridge, you would have thought that it was the middle of the  day because of the rows of parked buses. Unfortunately, all the people came in  from a wide area, and I am sure that some were trying to peddle their wares.  However, we must make our young people aware of the dangers, and that can  happen only through parents, community workers and so on. I cannot speak highly  enough of the people I saw with my own two eyes last weekend. They have to be  given every encouragement to do what they do, and, if they need resources from  the Health Department, those should be made available. We must remember one  thing: the people that they help are somebody&rsquo;s child.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: The debate  reinforces the view that alcohol and drug misuse has an all too real impact on  Northern Ireland, and research that my Department recently commissioned placed  the total cost of alcohol abuse in Northern Ireland as high as &pound;900 million a  year, with a cost of up to &pound;160 million to the Health Service. That is a  shocking figure, and the cost to society of drug misuse undoubtedly adds to  that figure. That money and those resources could and should be spent to  provide front line services to local communities, particularly considering the  likely impact of any cuts. Of course, individual tragedy is at the core of  those figures.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am particularly conscious of the links between alcohol  and drug misuse, domestic violence and poor mental health and the impact that  those have on child protection and child neglect. Those links are a key driver  on which my Department has taken action to tackle hidden harm to children who  have been born to and brought up by parents or carers who have substance misuse  problems. We also know that a large number of people who attend A&amp;E units  at weekends do so as a result of alcohol misuse. The link between substance  misuse and suicide is equally concerning, and everyone in the House is aware of  the recent tragic suicides among young people. Any strategic planning on  alcohol and drug misuse and suicide prevention should reflect and acknowledge  that link.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Compared with the rest of Northern   Ireland, the Upper Bann  area reports fewer adults and young people in treatment for alcohol and/or drug  misuse. Figures also show a lower prevalence of the use of alcohol and drugs.  However, there are slightly higher rates of cannabis misuse compared with the Northern Ireland  average, and that is reflected in the treatment and prevalence figures.  However, we are aware that those figures often do not seem to reflect the  situation on the ground in local communities, and that is why preventing and  addressing the harm related to alcohol and drug misuse has been and will  continue to be a key priority. To that end, my Department leads on the  cross-departmental, cross-sectoral new strategic direction for drugs and  alcohol. Work is under way to renew and extend that strategy up to 2016, and it  will be ready for consultation in the very near future. I am very conscious  that that issue must be addressed and identified at local level in partnership  with all the key agencies and stakeholders.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the Public Health Agency, there are four local drug and  alcohol co-ordination teams (DACTs), which have been set up specifically to  identify local needs and to put in place relevant local services to meet those  needs. The four drugs and alcohol co-ordination teams were allocated just over  &pound;5&middot;5 million in 2010-11 to implement their plans, and the Southern DACT, which  covers the Upper Bann area, was allocated around &pound;1&middot;2 million in 2010-11. In  addition to the funding allocated in support of the new strategic direction for  alcohol and drugs, funding is available through the mental health services  budget for the provision of addiction services and related mental health services.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">7.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The services that are in place include a community alcohol  and drugs support service, including a service to address the needs of the  black and minority ethnic population; family support services; child and family  care liaison practitioners; hospital liaison practitioners; a dual diagnosis  service for substance misuse and mental health; a specialist treatment  practitioner for under-18s; a 10-bed inpatient provision at St Luke&rsquo;s Hospital  for people suffering from severe and complex substance dependence issues; and a  hidden harm service supporting the needs of young people born or living with  substance-misusing parents or carers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have also tasked the agency and the board to develop new  commissioning frameworks for addiction services. Those frameworks will be built  on an assessment of need and current evidence of what works. One issue that we  are aware of is the need to address the complex needs of under-18s, and I want  the board and the agency to consider that area as part of their framework. Counselling  and mentoring services have been put in place already for under-18s across Northern Ireland and in the Upper   Bann area. That is provided by the counselling health information  lifestyle (CHILL) project, which is directed particularly at under-18s. In respect  of mental health tier 4 inpatient services for under-18s, we now have an 18-bed  unit for 14- to 17-year-olds and a 15-bed unit available for young people under  14 at Forster Green. Those units were opened during the summer.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate that complex cases, especially those involving  alcohol and drug misuse, present their own unique pressures, and I want that  issue to be considered in the commissioning framework. In a new area of work, I  have tasked the Public Health Agency to bring forward a one-stop shop pilot  project for young people. Those services provide information, advice, support  and signposting to young people who are affected by substance misuse. They  should also address related issues such as suicide and self-harm; mental health  and well-being; sexual health; relationship issues; resilience; and coping with  school and employment. The Public Health Agency has established four pilot  projects to test a range of potential models, and I am delighted to see that  being taken forward in Banbridge through the REACT project. The next step is to  evaluate the projects, and, subject to positive outcomes, I want the one-stop  shop model to be rolled out.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will take a closer look at alcohol misuse. It should be  noted that alcohol is still our drug of choice in Northern Ireland. As well as  ensuring that there is a clear focus on prevention and on enforcement of  licensing legislation, we must address how alcohol is promoted and sold.  Research shows that alcohol is now 62% more affordable than it was in the late  1980s; it is cheaper to buy than bottled water. The affordability of alcohol is  directly linked to levels of consumption. Therefore, through the young people&rsquo;s  drinking action plan, I established a subgroup involving my Department and DSD to  look at alcohol pricing and promotions. That group made the case for action now  on irresponsible promotions and for further consideration to be given to issues  such as minimum unit pricing and below-cost selling in due course. That work is  being taken forward as a priority, and a consultation, which is being led by  DSD, is under way. I ask that we all provide further support work in that area.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Another issue that I am keen to address as a priority is  so-called legal highs. I am aware that that has been a significant issue in the  Upper Bann area and across Northern    Ireland. In March this year, I wrote to the  Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs and the former Home Secretary on the  issue. I also spoke directly to the former Home Secretary asking for  consideration to be given to the introduction of a new classification in the  Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. That would allow emerging substances to be banned  while full consideration is given to their potential to cause harm. In other  words, rather than waiting to prove harm before we ban them, we would ban them  when they are issued and determine whether or not they are harmful in due  course. The coalition Government in Westminster  are now proposing to bring forward such legislation as soon as possible.  However, there is evidence that mephedrone misuse is continuing. We, therefore,  need to work at a regional and local level to prevent those new drugs from  further damaging our communities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The new strategic direction for alcohol and drugs, which  was published in October 2006, will now be updated and extended for a further  five years. The areas likely to have additional focus in the revised document  include legal highs, prescription drug misuse, cocaine misuse and improving  family support and involvement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to take this opportunity to acknowledge the  commitment and dedication of all the individuals and the community and  voluntary organisations working in this area. They perform difficult jobs,  often with little recognition or reward, but they have a real impact on the  lives of some of the most vulnerable people in society and help to make our  communities better places to live. We will only begin to truly have an impact  on drug and alcohol misuse when we take a holistic, integrated and co-ordinated  approach. Let us be clear about this: we all have a responsibility to tackle  the issue, and we need to work together across Departments and sectors in order  to do so.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It would be remiss of me not to point out to Mr Anderson &mdash;  I see that Mr Moutray has departed from the Chamber &mdash; that the Northern Ireland  Health Service is the worst funded Health Service in the whole of the UK. People in Northern Ireland do worse than those in any  other part of the UK.  The Health Service has recently been battling with a &pound;160 million cut, which  this House voted through. It is very difficult to fund the sort of activity  that we need to fund against that background. I ask Mr Anderson to consider  carefully his approach to protecting the health budget. The amount spent on  health provision here is over &pound;600 million behind what is spent in England, and we  are falling further and further behind. It is up to the House to determine  whether the issues that we are talking about here are a priority, and, if they  are, we need to fund them properly. We are talking literally about life and  death issues for large numbers of our population, particularly youngsters.</p>
