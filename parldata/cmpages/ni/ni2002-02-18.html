                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. I first wish to make a statement on a
                previous point of order.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the sitting on Tuesday 12 February, Mr
                Billy Hutchinson asked on a point of order why the time
                allocated by the Business Committee to the debate on the motion
                ‘Protecting Children, Supporting Parents’ (2000) was
                extended.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Speaker put the question that the
                debate be extended on the basis that it appeared to be the clear
                wish of all Members present; there was no dissenting voice. In
                the event, almost no extra time was required for the debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I must make it clear that Standing Orders
                make no provision for such an extension. Indeed, it is clearly
                the role of the Business Committee alone to allocate times for
                categories of business; Standing Order 10(2) refers. Therefore,
                the question of extending the time was not in order. Where
                Members have tabled a motion that they would perceive as
                requiring a substantive debate, they should make that known to
                their representative on the Business Committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to make it clear that the events that
                took place during the motion ‘Protecting Children, Supporting
                Parents’ (2000) are in no way to be construed as setting a
                precedent. Such a question should not be put again under current
                Standing Orders.</p>

                agreed to set up an interdepartmental working group, yet I

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is not a point of order. If the Member
                wishes to draw my attention to a problem that he perceives to be
                of a constitutional nature between the Assembly and the
                Executive, he should do so with me privately in the first
                instance, and then we can see what appropriate action can be
                taken.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. If the
                ruling that you have just made reflects how matters stand,
                Standing Orders must be changed. No House that I know of is not
                master of itself. The House should be sovereign, especially when
                it is unanimous, so we must look at the Standing Orders.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is perfectly in order for the Procedures
                Committee to look at the Standing Orders. Several arguments can
                be adduced in either direction. Sometimes it is not hard to
                reach unanimity in the House because so few Members are present.
                If my attention is drawn to the absence of a quorum, the House
                must suspend. In such contexts, to get the leave of the House
                may not be too difficult.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member has raised a very clear argument.
                It is quite appropriate for that matter to be brought to the
                Procedures Committee, which, if it wishes, can bring the matter
                to the House. That is the proper order of things.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. Will you
                confirm that, although the procedure was invalid, the original
                decision was not invalid even though it may have been taken
                after the allotted time?</p>

                for the Speaker to make a ruling in such post hoc circumstances

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I beg leave to present a petition from
                residents in the village of Mosside in north Antrim. The
                petition refers to the proposed closure of Mosside Primary
                School later this year and is signed by 200 people from the
                village who are opposed to the closure of that small, rural
                primary school. The petition says that closure will damage the
                future of the village and remove from children a local school
                that has an impressive record of good results, in spite of
                shortfalls in departmental resources and competition from other
                local schools.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To remove a school from any village decimates
                the heart of a village and takes children from the area. The
                closure of the school will inconvenience the local rural
                community and cause great upset. The petitioners also make clear
                that, alongside educational and community arrangements for
                maintaining the school, there is a substantial question of the
                safety of children on the roads.</p>

                Commission sectoral meeting of the North/South Ministerial
                Council, I wish to make a few remarks on the recent fishing
                tragedy in Kilkeel.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The entire House will join with me in
                expressing our deepest sympathy to the Greene family and to the
                entire fishing community on this unspeakable tragedy, which has
                taken the lives of three generations of one family, including
                that of an eight-year-old boy. I have visited members of the
                family, whose main concern is to find the boat and recover their
                loved ones’ bodies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As soon as I became aware of the need for
                naval support to assist the search, I spoke to British Minister
                John Spellar and to the Irish Government. My concern was to
                secure the necessary back-up as quickly as possible. It became
                clear that the Royal Navy did not have an adequately equipped
                naval vessel available in local waters. I am, however, pleased
                to report that the Irish naval vessel LE Eithne is being
                mobilised and will leave its base in County Cork this afternoon.
                It is expected to arrive on the County Down coast in the early
                hours of Tuesday morning.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I pay tribute to the local fishing fleet and
                to the other boats, including our fisheries protection vessel,
                the Ken Vickers. They have worked tirelessly in the past couple
                of days on this very sad search. We can only hope that the
                arrival of the LE Eithne will help to bring some solace to the
                Greene family.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also express my appreciation to the British
                Government for their co-operation, and to the Irish Government
                for their speedy response to this awful human tragedy.</p>

                Ministerial Council for the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights

                progress in work on shellfisheries, the interpretive centre and
                marine tourism. He also referred to the review of the Loughs
                Agency’s staffing structure, which Ministers had requested be
                carried out following their approval of an interim staffing
                structure. A draft report on the review, carried out by
                PriceWaterhouseCoopers, was presented to the agency on 9
                January. The draft report was forwarded to the sponsoring
                Departments for comment and considered by the board at a meeting
                during the last week of January. My Department is considering
                the report as a matter of priority and will respond to it as
                soon as possible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Pat Griffin, a member of the board of the
                Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission, then gave an
                account of a recent visit to Holland by board members and Loughs
                Agency staff. Holland has one of the most efficient and
                sustainable mussel industries in Europe, and the agency chose
                that destination as it represented a useful learning
                opportunity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The visit incorporated trips to licensed
                sites, the Fisheries Research Institute and the auction
                facilities. The agency was impressed by the emphasis placed on
                such environmental factors as the sustainability of bird
                populations and the treatment of predators. The agency was also
                impressed by the industry’s capacity to identify and move
                mussel seed between different plots deemed suitable for
                different stages of mussel growth, and with the efficiency of
                the electronic auction system, which can accept bids for mussel
                stock from around the world. It was apparent to our visiting
                colleagues that good management of the shellfisheries in Lough
                Foyle and Carlingford Lough has the potential to create a
                valuable export market to Holland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The chief executive of the agency, Mr Derick
                Anderson, provided the meeting with an explanation for the delay
                in presenting accounts for the agency’s predecessor, the Foyle
                Fisheries Commission, and the knock-on delay that that has
                caused in presenting agency accounts. He explained that a
                computerised accountancy system had been introduced, on which
                all accounts operated accurately with the exception of the
                nominal ledger. The difficulties with the nominal ledger were
                not fully exposed for some time, as the Foyle Fisheries
                Commission and, latterly, the Loughs Agency were under resource
                pressure due to additional work as a result of an expanding
                remit.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To rectify the problems with the nominal
                ledger, the Loughs Agency employed consultants
                PriceWaterhouseCoopers, and recruited and trained additional
                administrative staff. With that extra support, the agency was
                able to provide all required information to facilitate
                completion of the audit of outstanding accounts.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fully audited accounts for the Foyle
                Fisheries Commission for the years 1997, 1998 and 1999 were due
                to be forwarded to the agency during the week ending 15
                February. Responsibility for the audit of accounts for the
                Loughs Agency for the years 2000 and 2001 rests with the
                Northern Ireland Audit Office. It has already undertaken the
                bulk of the groundwork, but it requires closed 1999 accounts
                before it can finalise the audit of the later accounts.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is anticipated that the accounts for
                2000-01 will be completed in March. The chief executive
                apologised for the delay in finalising the outstanding accounts
                and assured Ministers that appropriate mechanisms, staff and
                controls are now in place to ensure that the Loughs Agency does
                not cause such delays again.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The chief executive advised the meeting of
                the progress that has been made towards completing the agency’s
                interpretive centre. The agency is undertaking a baseline survey
                to establish the level of children’s knowledge of the fishery
                resource, and some video footage has been shot of salmon
                spawning in the River Finn. Plans for the interior design and
                decoration of the centre are under way, and the agency is on
                target and within budget to open it by September 2002.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ministers were updated on the agency’s
                plans to host a workshop on research into seal predation of
                salmon and on the continuing positive impact of the salmon
                carcass tagging scheme, particularly the significant downturn in
                illegal netting and the increase in logbook returns, especially
                from anglers. That enhancement of the agency’s management data
                will make a positive contribution to its ability to manage and
                conserve the valuable salmon fisheries in the Foyle area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The chief executive referred to the agency’s
                work with angling clubs and fishery owners on applications for
                EU funding for several enhancement projects. He looks forward to
                the positive contribution such projects have the potential to
                make to increasing the number of salmon in the system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ministers took the opportunity to thank the
                agency for its continuing good work, and, in particular, they
                urged it to do everything in its power to advance its
                outstanding accounts.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ministers considered and approved the agency’s
                corporate plan for 2002-04 and its business plan for 2002. The
                corporate plan sets out its objectives for the management,
                protection, conservation and improvement of salmon, inland and
                shellfish fisheries in the Foyle and Carlingford areas, and the
                development of marine tourism. It also outlines its objectives
                for the statutory equality obligations, the development of its
                staff, and health and safety at work and includes budgetary
                details.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The business plan sets more specific targets
                for 2002. It addresses issues such as aquaculture licensing, the
                reduction of illegal fishing, the provision of advice on a range
                of issues, including pollution prevention, awareness raising,
                and the provision and use of a variety of management information
                to inform and support the management of the fisheries. Printed
                copies will be available from the agency’s headquarters in
                March.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ministers considered a paper on the progress
                made in establishing an advisory forum that was approved at an
                earlier meeting. Its purpose is to ensure that those with an
                interest in the use and management of the resources in the Foyle
                and Carlingford areas have a mechanism through which their views
                may be put to the agency. The selection process was undertaken
                on the agency’s behalf by management consultants. There were
                some initial difficulties in recruiting a sufficient number of
                people to represent all the interests, but we were pleased to
                note that, following a further targeted recruitment exercise,
                the full range of representation has been achieved. Members of
                the advisory forum include representatives of shellfishing,
                draft net fishing, drift net fishing, anglers, fishery owners,
                tourism, environmental groups, local businesses, councils, ports
                and harbours, forestry and agriculture.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The advisory forum held its first meeting at
                the end of January, when members were given detailed
                presentations on the work of the agency and its future plans. It
                is proposed that, when it meets again in March, individual focus
                groups will be set up to concentrate on advising the agency on
                specific areas of interest.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ministers noted the final version of the
                agency’s equality scheme, which received approval from the
                Equality Commission on 7 November 2001, and approved its New TSN
                action plan. Both the equality scheme and the action plan
                underpin the agency’s work, and their implementation will
                strengthen its commitment to equality, fairness, and tackling
                social need and social exclusion. Copies of both documents are
                available from the agency on request.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ministers considered a paper on the
                difficulties presented by an aquaculture site in Carlingford
                Lough, licensed by the Department of the Marine and Natural
                Resources, the boundaries of which have caused problems for
                Northern fishermen trying to access the public mussel fishery.
                Minister Fahey accepted that a speedy resolution was required,
                and officials from both Departments, along with staff from the
                Loughs Agency, have been asked to resolve the issue by the next
                meeting.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Progress on the drafting of the Foyle and
                Carlingford fisheries Bill was discussed next. The Bill proposes
                to extend the functions of the agency in line with the
                North/South Co-operation (Implementation Bodies) (Northern
                Ireland) Order 1999 and to update the Foyle fisheries Acts. To
                date, good progress has been made in resolving some intricate
                policy matters. As the legislation affects both parts of the
                island of Ireland, it was agreed that drafting of the provisions
                would be split between the relevant offices, North and South.
                Although the Office of the Legislative Counsel has produced its
                part of the Bill, progress has been hampered in the South by the
                involvement of their draftsman in drafting other Bills. However,
                Minister Fahey agreed to encourage the Attorney-General’s
                Office to give the Bill priority, with a view to producing the
                South’s contribution to the draft as soon as possible to
                facilitate introduction in the Assembly and the Dáil at the
                earliest opportunity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The meeting considered a paper on the
                transfer of the functions of the Commissioners of Irish Lights
                to the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission. It is
                clear that the functions of the commissioners will remain a
                reserved matter, with the UK Government continuing to exercise
                policy and funding control as a consequence of their
                responsibility as trustees of the general lighthouse fund.
                Therefore, it appears that the Lights Agency element of the
                Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission will not comply
                with the definition of an implementation body, as set out in
                strand two of the Good Friday Agreement. Members will be aware
                that the matter has been referred to the North/South Ministerial
                Council in its institutional format. At its meeting on 17
                December, it was agreed that officials from both Administrations
                and from the joint secretariat of the North/South Ministerial
                Council would consider the matter further, and offer advice and
                recommendations to the council. Preliminary discussions have
                begun with a view to submitting a report and recommendations to
                the next meeting of the Council in its institutional format.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The North/South Ministerial Council agreed to
                meet again in April 2002, and it approved a joint communiqué, a
                copy of which has been placed in the Assembly Library.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This statement was made on my behalf and on
                behalf of Mr Nesbitt.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for
                Agriculture and Rural Development (Rev Dr Ian Paisley):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am sure that the House will endorse the
                Minister’s remarks at the beginning of her statement and will
                wish to express its sympathy also. It has been said that great
                grief is not good at talking, and how true that is. Who can
                express the depth of sorrow caused by the wound that has been
                inflicted by the loss of three generations of one family? I am
                sure that everyone in the Assembly understands that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the fact that vessels will be sent
                to that area. I received a representation from Kilkeel
                yesterday. I spoke to Mr Spellar’s personal secretary and
                pointed out that the fishermen were worried that bad weather
                would mean that the vessels would not be of much use. However,
                the weather conditions were favourable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given the size of the British naval service,
                I am amazed that it does not have a boat with the equipment to
                do this job. We are grateful to the Dublin authorities for
                sending a vessel. However, I ask the Minister to press the
                British authorities further to send a fully-equipped naval
                vessel that has the ability to carry out the soundings necessary
                to search for the lost vessel. Two boats could cover a greater
                area than one.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Everyone knows that it is imperative to find
                the vessel, so that the bodies of those who have been lost can
                be brought back and receive a burial, and so that the family can
                have one sore anointed with healing balm. The other sore and its
                scar will remain on their lives for ever. I wish the boats well
                in their efforts to find the bodies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I salute all the fishermen in that area and
                all those who went out in boats to help the search. I also
                salute the strength of the family at this time and trust that
                the bodies will soon be brought back to the home port.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Rodgers:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for his remarks and
                expression of sympathy to the family. I am deeply grateful that
                a vessel is being prepared to leave Haulbowline in County Cork
                at 2.00 pm to travel up the Irish coast. It is hoped that it
                will reach the Down coast by 2.00 am tomorrow morning, and I
                understand that it will begin the search immediately.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recognise that the family’s grief is
                being added to by the fact that the bodies have not been
                recovered and that, as Dr Paisley has said, it would be a great
                ease to them if they could be recovered. I have been informed
                that the police diving team has offered its services to the
                coastguard, while the fishing fleet and the Ken Vickers are
                fully involved in the search. Should it become apparent that a
                wreckage has been found, the police divers will offer help to
                the coast guard or the lifeboat service, whichever may be
                appropriate. That is an example of the great co-operation that
                there has been throughout the community, North/South, east/west
                and within all the Government agencies to try to resolve one of
                the greatest tragedies that I have known in fishing history in
                my lifetime in this part of the world. We must also remember
                that a brother of Michael Greene was drowned in Kilkeel harbour
                13 years ago. This has been a real tragedy for this family.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The agency plans to concentrate on improving
                marine tourism by developing the recreation and leisure aspects
                of fisheries and catchments. However, it does not propose to
                provide direct funding. The agency also intends to commission a
                marine tourism audit in the Foyle and Carlingford areas to
                ascertain the level of facilities currently available. The
                agency hopes to publish its marine tourism strategy later this
                year.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I
                extend my sympathy, and that of my Colleagues, to the Greene
                family and the local community. Such communities have always
                been prepared to face the worst that the sea has often dealt to
                them: Nevertheless, such incidents are still an enormous tragedy
                for them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s statement,
                particularly her comments on the work that continues on the
                overall meeting. The Fisheries Bill was discussed, as was the
                progress made, North and South. We need the draft legislation as
                soon as possible to facilitate the early introduction of the
                Bill in the Assembly and in the Dáil. What progress has been
                made on that legislation, given the fact that it has been
                delayed?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Rodgers:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Legislation is necessary to provide the
                Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission with the power to
                license and develop aquaculture. The drafting of the legislation
                is progressing, and I intend to introduce the Bill later this
                year. My officials are fully committed to taking the Bill
                forward, but progress is subject to parallel development in both
                jurisdictions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill was initially delayed due to several
                difficulties in establishing a mechanism to enable those people
                aggrieved at decisions of the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish
                Lights Commission on aquaculture applications to appeal. It also
                proved more difficult than anticipated to obtain the agreement
                of legal advisors in both jurisdictions on several policy
                matters. Most of those issues have now been resolved, but
                further delay has occurred because, due to competing priorities,
                the draftsman in the South has been unable to produce a draft of
                the Bill. However, we hope that that matter will now be
                addressed. I have spoken about the matter to Minister Fahey, who
                is arranging to have the issue prioritised. I hope to be able to
                progress the legislation soon.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister will accept that one of the most
                painful duties that we have had in the last few days has been to
                visit the homes of those who were so tragically struck by this
                dreadful incident. Can she assure me that her Department will
                put the maximum pressure on the Marine Accident Investigation
                Board to ensure that a Royal Navy vessel, in addition to the
                Irish Navy vessel, is sent immediately to this area to assist?
                It is unfortunate that no Royal Navy vessel was available for
                dispatch to the area. Although we appreciate the help offered by
                the Irish Government, the situation flags up a concern for the
                future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister also agree that it is vital
                that lines of communication be clarified, so that if such a
                dreadful incident should happen again there would be one point
                of contact with the marine authorities to ensure that a vessel
                would be dispatched immediately? One of the great difficulties
                yesterday was that no one was certain of who had the final
                authority on the matter. That was one of the reasons for the
                delay.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, can she assure the House that if the
                trawler is found, and if it is deemed necessary to raise it to
                the surface, there will be no delay in doing so and a Government
                Department will fund that work? The bodies need to be found, so
                as to give closure to the family affected by this terrible
                event.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Rodgers:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree. I have done everything in my power
                to ensure that the necessary back-up support of naval vessels
                from either or both jurisdictions is made available, and I will
                continue to use my influence to ensure progress on that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have already reported about the progress so
                far. I understand from Mr Wells that there was some confusion
                yesterday morning in the lines of communication. I heard about
                the incident from the fishermen’s representative at 2.00 pm on
                the radio and was able to establish immediately the
                responsibility of the Department for Transport, Local Government
                and the Regions across the water and the Ministry of Defence,
                which has the remit of the naval fleet. It is a reserved matter,
                of course, so responsibility lies with those Departments.
                However, as the Minister responsible for fisheries here, I felt
                that it was incumbent on me to do everything possible to ensure
                that the necessary back-up was provided. I was pleased to be
                able to do that and to have the L E Eithne prepared and soon to
                be on her way up here. Any other matters relating to the
                operation of the naval fleet are not my responsibility, but I
                take the point. It is important that back-up should be available
                when and if necessary.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the trawler is located, I will do
                everything possible to ensure that it is raised, because that is
                extremely important for the families.</p>

                Fisheries Commission’s accounts and the Loughs Agency’s
                accounts. I also welcome the establishment of the advisory forum
                and the focus groups, which will represent interest groups in
                the Loughs Agency’s catchment area. However, was the
                opportunity taken to impress on Minister Fahey that, although he
                is reducing the number of net licences and quotas, the Republic
                of Ireland still lags behind Northern Ireland and other European
                countries on measures to bring to an end the slaughter — and
                that is the only word that I can use to describe it — of the
                salmon off our coasts?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Rodgers:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I stated in my report that the agency’s
                presentation of the 2000-01 accounts was delayed because the
                accounts of the Foyle Fisheries Commission had not been
                finalised. We now hope to have full accounting in March. The
                corporate business plans are currently with the designers, and
                they should be available in March. Copies will be made available
                from the Loughs Agency’s headquarters in Prehen and its
                regional office in Carlingford. The agency’s equality scheme
                will be published in full in this April or May, and its New TSN
                action plan can be viewed on its web site.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Loughs Agency has no plans at the moment
                to buy out salmon nets, but the stocks of salmon returning to
                the Foyle catchment area are managed effectively to ensure that
                spawning escapement targets are achieved each year. The
                effectiveness of the conservation and protection regulations
                introduced by the agency to help manage the fish stocks are
                continually kept under review using data collected from fish
                counters, population surveys and catch returns. As escapement
                targets are currently being achieved, and a stable commercial
                and recreational fishery exists, the agency has no plans to
                introduce further conservation measures at this time.</p>

                in the Foyle system. I commend the good work of many angling

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In association with my Department, Queen’s
                University Belfast and the Irish Marine Institute in Dublin, the
                Loughs Agency has engaged in a two-year genetic study of salmon
                populations for the purpose of obtaining further management
                information to ensure the future sustainability of salmon stocks
                in the Foyle system. The agency has also introduced a salmon
                carcass tagging scheme, which prohibits the sale of untagged
                salmon. That has resulted in a substantial reduction in the
                levels of poaching in the Foyle and Carlingford areas, thus
                enabling the agency to direct more resources toward enhancement,
                development and reinstatement of the catchments. Therefore,
                ultimately, it will further improve the productivity of the
                catchments. The tagging scheme also requires anglers to complete
                logbooks detailing the number of catches made. Those logbooks
                will provide the agency with valuable information that will help
                to ensure that the fisheries of the Foyle and Carlingford areas
                continue to be managed effectively.</p>

                delayed the operational search and rescue mission travelling to
                the scene of the Kilkeel tragedy? Will she look at ways of

                be repeated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I said, I responded as soon as I was made
                aware of the issue at 2.00 pm, when I was on my way to visit the
                families. I did not come across any red tape difficulties. I was
                able to establish immediately that the Department for Transport,
                Local Government and the Regions and the Ministry of Defence
                across the water shared the responsibility — the former is
                responsible for the coastguard and the latter for the naval
                vessel. I assure the Member that between 2.00 pm and 5.00 pm, I

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member may be referring to the long delay
                in getting the vessel up here. It takes a while, particularly on
                a Sunday evening, to assemble the crew — at least five or six
                hours, perhaps longer during a weekend. It then takes several
                hours to prepare the vessel for steaming and considerable time
                for the vessel to come from Cork to the Down coast. There was
                another delay while they ensured that they were able to get the
                divers, an important element for the recovery.</p>

                happened, the Ken Vickers, which is the departmental fisheries

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With reference to the Minister’s

                potential for export markets? Has any investigation been carried
                out into the zebra mussel, a freshwater mussel that has become a
                plague in most of the Southern rivers and lakes, and is now a
                threat to our rivers and estuaries? What progress has the
                Minister made in ensuring that our waters are not polluted by
                this plague of freshwater mussels?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thirdly, the fishermen of Lough Foyle tell me
                that poaching still causes their greatest loss of revenue. Very
                few salmon make it into the River Mourne, through Sion Mills and
                up to the headwaters of the Foyle, the Strule, the Drumragh, and
                the Camowen. What effective action has been taken? Despite the
                attempt at tagging, there has not as yet been a successful
                effort to control illegal poaching of salmon in the Foyle
                estuary or the Foyle waters. I appeal to the Minister, on behalf
                of the people of those areas who depend on the industry for
                tourism, to make every effort to ensure that adequate salmon
                stock emerge in those headwaters.</p>

                statement. At the end of her statement, she said that the Lights
                Agency element of the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Have the Minister and her Executive

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What happened last week in Kilkeel was a
                tragedy. As a Member for the Strangford constituency, I remember
                a similar search off the Isle of Man for the body of the crewman
                and boat owner Tom Hughes. At that time, the help of the Royal
                Navy was requested. The good work of the locals, who dived and
                searched, led to the retrieval of the body for the funeral.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A rapid reaction is needed. What is the
                Minister doing to ensure that that legislation can be changed?
                She said that it was a reserved matter. However, what
                representations can the Minister or her Department make on that?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. It is wise to point out to the House
                that questions to a Minister must refer only to the Minister’s
                responsibility. It is clear that the burden of the question that
                the Member is asking is on a reserved matter; which is the
                responsibility of the Secretary of State for Defence. For the
                Member to tread on that is to tread on the parliamentary
                responsibilities of his colleagues who are Members at
                Westminster. It may well be that he wishes to press the Minister
                on making representations. That would not be inappropriate.
                However, to ask the Minister questions about matters outwith her
                responsibilities would be out of order.</p>

                the Royal Navy more accountable and reactive when help is
                needed? We require an effective and co-ordinated response. Our
                fishermen deserve the full support of the authorities. A clear

                have bent all my energies towards that. I have not looked at any
                further steps that might be taken: That is for another day. My

                work? How were they selected, and how much did it cost the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In moving the motion, I will draw attention
                briefly to a few points. The debate follows the Bill’s First
                Stage on Tuesday 12 February, and the Supply resolutions for the
                2001-02 spring Supplementary Estimates and the 2002-03 Vote on
                Account, which were also considered and approved last week. The
                Bill can be given accelerated passage because the Committee for
                Finance and Personnel has confirmed that, in line with Standing
                Order 40, the Committee is satisfied that there has been
                appropriate consultation on the public expenditure proposals
                contained in the Bill. This condition has been met, and the
                confirmation was given in a letter dated 5 February from the
                Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and Personnel to the
                Speaker. I welcome the Committee’s assistance in the matter,
                especially in view of the concerns that the Committee has
                expressed about the process and its role within it. For the
                record, I understand those concerns and recognise the need to
                address them over the coming months.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The purpose of the Budget Bill is to give
                legislative effect to the resource Estimates approved through
                the Supply resolutions passed last Monday. Given the
                wide-ranging and valuable debate that we had then, I do not
                intend to delay the start of today’s debate with unnecessary
                repetition of the detail that I covered last week when I
                introduced the Supply resolutions. Members have received copies
                of the detailed spring Supplementary Estimates booklet and the
                Vote on Account statement. Copies of the Budget Bill and
                associated explanatory and financial memorandum should also be
                available. However, for the benefit of the Assembly, I wish to
                summarise briefly the main features of the Bill in accordance
                with the nature of the Second Stage debate envisaged under
                Standing Order 30.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill authorises the issue of £198
                million from the Northern Ireland Consolidated Fund in respect
                of the spring Supplementary Estimates for 2001-02 and
                appropriates this sum to specific services as set out in
                schedule 1. Schedule 2 authorises the use of additional
                resources for 2001-02 amounting to £574 million and details the
                revised limits for accruing resources.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Vote on Account provided for in the Bill
                for 2002-03 is to allow funds to continue to flow to public
                services for the early months of the incoming financial year
                until the Main Estimates can be presented to, and considered by,
                the Assembly. For the Vote on Account, the Budget Bill seeks the
                issue from the Consolidated Fund of the sum of £3,936 million
                and its appropriation to services as set out in schedule 3. In
                addition, it seeks the Assembly’s authorisation for the use of
                resources amounting to £4,486 million as set out in schedule 4.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was most interested to hear the many views
                expressed by Members during last week’s useful debate. I
                endeavoured to answer most of the questions at the time or to
                provide responses later, either personally or from my
                ministerial Colleagues as appropriate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is little more that I can usefully add
                on the substance of the Budget Bill, but I shall respond to any
                points raised by Members on the principle of the Bill.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly offers Members a great
                opportunity to influence public expenditure allocations, to hold
                Departments accountable for those allocations and to ensure that
                the outcomes promised as part of the spending programmes are
                delivered. As I said earlier, our budgetary processes are still
                evolving, and each budgetary exercise is important in helping us
                to understand problems or difficulties that we can improve on or
                address. I accept that we may need to refine our processes,
                where that is possible, within the limitations of the existing
                system. However, it is fair to say that the Assembly has
                undertaken its responsibilities for public expenditure,
                authorisation and control with considerable care and diligence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to draw attention to the fact that, in
                the coming months, the Executive will be engaged in intensive
                preparations for, and negotiations on, the spending review 2002.
                That review will set parameters for expenditure for the
                following three years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The challenges posed by the need to meet the
                significant investment requirements of many of our services are
                probably already apparent to all Members. In the past two years,
                we have seen the expenditure limits imposed by the available
                resources, and the difficult choices that are necessary in order
                to ensure that fair and equitable allocations were made. The
                Executive are examining, in a fundamental way, the basis of
                current resource allocations by the Treasury. In that respect,
                the Barnett formula is being subjected to detailed and rigorous
                analysis to determine the extent to which it should, or should
                not, continue to be the basis for determining those resources.
                Alongside that examination, the Executive, as Members may be
                aware, are also conducting detailed needs assessments across all
                the Departments. Those assessments are intended to provide
                information on the precise scale of need in each Department with
                respect to the services for which it has responsibility.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is widely recognised that there is a major
                backlog in investment and that that backlog exists across almost
                all our services and infrastructure. We have to ensure,
                therefore, that our case is as strong, robust and well founded
                as we can make it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our needs are considerable. Given the signals
                from London, there is little doubt that we have a major task
                ahead in ensuring that the outcome of the forthcoming spending
                review is as favourable to us as it is possible to make it.</p>

                I thank the Minister for his statement and for his recognition
                of the Committee’s concerns. The Committee for Finance and
                Personnel confirmed to the Assembly that it was satisfied that
                the requirements of Standing Order 40(2) regarding consultation
                had been met, so that the Bill could proceed under the
                accelerated passage procedure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee did not do that lightly, and
                there was quite a debate on the issue, because it places a
                premium on the involvement of the Assembly and its Committees in
                the Budget process. The Committee for Finance and Personnel will
                wish to ensure that the arrangements for consulting Committees
                during the impending review year are comprehensive, timely and
                effective, and meet with the approval of all Committees. The
                Minister should be alert to the concerns regularly expressed by
                the Assembly Committees that they are not consulted effectively
                by Departments and that the timely provision of budgetary
                information by Departments is not always as good as it should be
                to allow Committees to perform their statutory role.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is essential, therefore, that when the
                Minister announces the timetable for the spending review in
                March, Committees be built into the consultation process from
                the beginning. Before signing off on accelerated passage for the
                next Budget Bill in June, the Committee for Finance and
                Personnel will need to be assured by other Committees that
                appropriate consultation has taken place and is planned before
                the draft Budget is introduced in September. That process of
                consultation is important in the spending review year.
                Committees will wish to see a positive benefit from the
                resources obtained from the Treasury, based on the needs and
                evaluation work of the Committees concerned.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee for Finance and Personnel
                recognises and supports the Executive’s priority focus on the
                need for substantial additional resources for the Health
                Service, education and the infrastructure. There are depressing
                daily accounts of how hospitals are failing to meet the needs of
                the sick. Pictures of frail and elderly people on hospital
                trolleys do not do any of us any credit. It is important that we
                recognise that those who elect us expect and demand more. We
                must make a difference where it matters most. Innovative ways to
                raise revenue without targeting the most needy must be used. The
                effectiveness and efficiency of public services must be examined
                rigorously to ensure best value.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Assembly Committees play a key role in
                scrutinising the work of Departments and in holding Ministers to
                account to the Assembly for the services for which they are
                responsible. Committees should be encouraged to target areas of
                poor performance and encourage value for money so that resources
                are freed up to meet those high priority needs. Departments
                still have a silo mentality.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Spending patterns must be challenged,
                evaluated and reset strategically. Appropriation of resources
                must be targeted to encourage greater co-operation between
                Departments. Short-term resources must be targeted on the
                immediate needs of the sick and must be matched by long-term
                strategic investments in health and education services. Better
                access to health services, and improvements in the social and
                physical environment of the population are needed. Long-term
                investments will lead to long-term savings through a more
                integrated approach in the public services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister’s recent decision to review
                the effectiveness of the in-year monitoring procedure is
                welcomed, and indicates his concern that Departments are not
                entirely effective in quantifying their budget needs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly is being asked to consider a
                Bill that appropriates a considerable amount of resources.
                Members will wish to be assured that those precious resources
                are deployed with maximum impact. The Committee for Finance and
                Personnel accepts that the Budget Bill is the end of a process
                of consultation with Departments. It also acknowledges that the
                process must focus on effective engagement with the Assembly and
                its Committees at an early stage if the Executive are to be
                truly accountable to the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee for Finance and Personnel looks
                forward to playing its part in the spending review process and
                encourages other Committees to play their part. They must be
                consulted and form part of the bidding process to ensure the
                effective use of resources. Go raibh maith agat.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for
                Finance and Personnel (Mr Leslie):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we debated the Second Stage of the
                Government Resources and Accounts Bill, I was the only person
                who expressed the view that, rather than making the accounts
                clearer, resource accounting would make them more complicated.
                Now that we have had a first look at the new-style Estimates and
                the Budget Bill, I feel vindicated in having expressed that
                view.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The suggestion put forward by the Committee
                for Finance and Personnel to have some form of training and
                elucidation on the new accounting style provided for Members is
                valid. I hope that that training will proceed shortly. I have no
                reason to believe that the Department is resistant to that
                suggestion and look forward to implementing it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After the recent Enron affair, many comments
                were made concerning creative accounting in the private sector.
                I expressed the view that a snag in moving to resource-based
                accounting is that the scope for creative accounting is
                considerably greater in the Government sector. The problem is
                not as severe when the Government are not responsible for the
                Supply side, as is the case here.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nonetheless, Members must work diligently to
                understand how resource-based accounting works. I do not fully
                understand it myself. However, examining the use of assets, and
                how they are treated in the Government’s books, will be
                helpful in informing our long-term investment decisions,
                especially those decisions on infrastructure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister emphasised that the three-year
                spending review will happen this year. I trust that the needs
                and effectiveness evaluation will be completed in time for the
                spending review, but it may be a close call. I am not sure how
                much input the Assembly and its Committees will have into that
                review. As I have said in other debates, it is no use trying to
                influence a Budget once it has been read. We must start to
                influence next year’s Budget now. We have about six months in
                which to influence the Budget. Once figures are written down and
                the draft Budget is read in the autumn, the scope for
                influencing the final Budget becomes extremely limited.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is the second full cycle in which the
                Chairperson of the Finance and Personnel Committee, Mr Molloy,
                and I have made that point. It must be reiterated that
                Committees must start addressing budgetary issues immediately
                and in the coming months. There is a slight window in the
                Assembly’s agenda before a heavy legislative programme begins
                in April. That may be the best chance that we shall have to get
                to grips with the budgetary issues for next year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I acknowledge the Minister’s comments on
                the Barnett formula and on proving the need for the resources
                that we currently receive. On the whole, we receive favourable
                treatment under the Barnett formula. I urge caution about
                following a divergent route, which carries the risk of a less
                favourable outcome. I note that comments were made recently in
                Westminster to the effect that it was unlikely that Barnett
                would be reviewed for the time being. I suspect that that will
                be to our advantage. I welcome the Budget Bill.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The final spring Supplementary Estimates
                contain an amazing error. I want to give the Minister the
                opportunity to respond to the statement that £93 million was
                allocated in the Department of Employment and Learning for fees
                and expenses for chairpersons and members of the industrial and
                fair employment tribunals. I doubt that the fees and expenses of
                those tribunals amounted to £93 million. The Minister should
                respond to that before the Bill goes through; he should give us
                the accurate figure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also concerned about an issue that
                relates to the announcement that was made last year about free
                nursing care. That became a huge issue for the Budget. I wrote
                to the Minister asking him to outline the easements — the
                surrendered moneys for which Departments can bid — and I
                discovered that £3·3 million had been surrendered, despite the
                fact that most of the population in Northern Ireland would have
                been told that no money had been available for free nursing
                care. I am concerned that £3·3 million was left sitting in the
                Department’s budget and was then surrendered. No doubt the
                Department made bids for other moneys.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Later in the year an announcement was made
                that resources would be found for free nursing care. I am
                concerned about that. Can the Minister reassure the House that
                the public are not being led to believe that that was new money,
                given that it had been there in the first instance?</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It may have been the case that we were not in
                a position to provide free nursing care because the legislation
                had not gone through. Perhaps that is the message that should
                have gone out at the time, rather than a message of insufficient
                funds being available. I know that £3·3 million might not have
                met all of the costs of introducing free nursing care at that
                time. However, before the Budget Bill goes through, we have an
                opportunity to clear the matter up. There was a surrender of
                £3·3 million. I have written to the Department and have
                received some explanation of it, but it is important that the
                matter be brought before the House.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Farren:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Members who have spoken during
                the Second Stage of the Budget Bill. The House has discussed
                many of the issues previously. It is not surprising, therefore,
                that a full-scale debate, as has occurred on previous occasions,
                has not developed this afternoon. I assure the Chairperson of
                the Committee for Finance and Personnel that full consultation
                has, to the best of the Department’s ability and within the
                time constraints applying, been taking place in the past two
                years. That consultation has been with the Committee for Finance
                and Personnel and all the other Committees, through contacts
                with officials and Ministers in the various Departments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The point that I made, which was made on
                several occasions by my predecessor, is that Committees are able
                to take the initiative by probing likely developments with
                respect to the relevant departmental budgets. Committees could
                perhaps do that more vigorously in anticipation, rather than
                simply awaiting the outcome of proposals relating to
                departmental bids. As was reflected in Mr Leslie’s comments,
                Members do not have to await the end of the preparatory stages
                of the Budget for that kind of probing to take place. Committees
                can begin to make their investigations now. Indeed, I believe
                that there was an example of that last week from the Chairperson
                of the Committee for Social Development, which I commended.
                Prioritisation was taking place in a way that I felt was helpful
                to the deliberations of that Committee and to its engagement
                with the Department. Let us see Committees being more willing to
                take the initiative in relation to the budgetary planning
                process.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the comments made by the Chairperson of
                the Committee for Finance and Personnel, and by Prof McWilliams,
                I wish to emphasise that in-year monitoring takes place to
                determine what might be available to be allocated to help meet
                pressing needs identified by Departments. When Departments make
                bids with respect to what might be available from in-year
                monitoring, the Department of Finance and Personnel responds to
                how Departments have prioritised their particular needs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive agreed in principle to the
                introduction of free universal nursing care for the elderly in
                nursing homes from April 2002. The Budget for 2001 contained
                £4·5 million to enable the introduction of free nursing care
                from October 2002. I emphasise that those who are unable to meet
                the costs of their care already have access to free nursing
                care, and that will continue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Legislation must be introduced, and
                procedures for the assessment of free nursing care developed and
                implemented. The figure of £4·5 million represents a part-year
                cost — it is not a reduction in the number of eligible people.
                The full-year cost is likely to be some £9 million. Additional
                funds will have to be found to support that in future years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The process to ensure the delivery of what
                the Assembly sought is under way. The timetable for that is
                constrained by the need to have the necessary legislation in
                place, and not only by finance issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams mentioned the allocation of
                £93 million to the Department of Employment and Learning. That
                appears to be a typing error, and should read as £93,000. That
                figure will be checked precisely, and the information will be
                provided to the Member in writing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Leslie mentioned the needs assessment
                exercise. It is hoped that some initial findings will be
                available at the end of March or early April to inform our
                approach to the spending review and the budgetary planning in
                which we shall be engaged in the next few months.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I acknowledge Mr Leslie’s point about the
                Barnett formula. However, the Member should acknowledge that
                there is a need and an obligation on the Executive, and
                especially on the Department of Finance and Personnel, to
                examine in considerable detail the extent to which the Barnett
                formula is robust enough to deliver our needs. We should be able
                to clearly identify any shortcomings in the formula and act upon
                them. We are currently examining the formula and its application
                to ensure that the bids are fairly and equitably met. That will
                also ensure that resources are available to meet the
                considerable challenges that I referred to in the concluding
                part of my opening address.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have covered all the main points that were
                raised by the three Members who have spoken. I will correspond

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the current community care arrangements
                were introduced in 1993, approximately 9,000 people in
                residential care in the independent sector were exempt from the
                new health and social services funding and care management
                arrangements. Instead, they acquired a preserved right to an
                enhanced rate of income support with which to pay for their
                residential accommodation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In recent times, there have been many
                submissions from homeowners and their representative
                organisations about the inadequacy of the preserved rights rate
                in relation to their operating costs. Furthermore, it has been
                suggested that, due to its inflexibility, the funding system may
                be failing some people, who may be better suited to either
                supported accommodation or alternative arrangements.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In England, the Royal Commission on Long Term
                Care for the Elderly recommended that the Government consider
                whether preserved rights payments and social security should be
                brought into the post-1993 system of community care funding or
                whether another solution could be found to address the shortfall
                in funding experienced by that group.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further to the Royal Commission’s
                consultation, in May and June 2000, the Department of Health,
                Social Services and Public Safety carried out further local
                consultation on the available options. The overall opinion
                supported a transfer of responsibility for the preserved rights
                cases to the normal health and social services care management
                arrangements, as it was considered inequitable that those people
                be treated differently to those who entered the care system
                after April 1993.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Personal Social Services (Preserved
                Rights) Bill is being introduced to transfer responsibility for
                the preserved rights cases to the normal care management
                arrangements of the health and social services trusts, where it
                more logically belongs, from April 2002. Regulations will also
                be implemented by the Department for Social Development to
                remove its entitlement for the enhanced rate of income support.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The intention is that the social security
                system here should run in parity with that in Great Britain. The
                entitlement to preserved rights social security in Great Britain
                will cease, with effect from 8 April. Failure to match that
                transfer date will result in considerable uncertainty for
                residents and their families here, and it could have a
                destabilising effect on the residential care and nursing home
                sector. If the legislation is not in place, we will be faced
                with trying to make appropriate contingency arrangements, which
                would not be a straightforward exercise.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the absence of the necessary legislation,
                two contingency options are most apparent. However, both are
                complex and will create many difficulties. The Social Security
                Agency might be able to continue to pay the enhanced benefit
                rates. However, because the legislation for the transfer is
                already in place in Great Britain, no preserved rights rates of
                benefit have been set for the period from 8 April onwards.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the Department for Social Development were
                to set a preserved rights rate, even for a short period, it
                would break parity with Great Britain. Furthermore, the
                functionality of the computer system that enables the social
                security offices to pay the rates to customers is provided from
                England and will be removed on 7 April. The Social Security
                Agency would then have to seek other methods of making payments
                to approximately 1,700 people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The other contingency option would be for
                approval to be given for the trusts to make payments on an
                extra-statutory basis. That poses considerable difficulties
                also. Under article 36(a) of the Health and Personal Social
                Services (Northern Ireland) Order 1972, the trusts are barred
                from taking responsibility for those cases. Therefore, the
                Department would be seeking the agreement of the Department of
                Finance and Personnel to not only act in anticipation of
                impending law, but to act in contravention of the existing law.
                Even if that agreement were forthcoming, in addition to the
                administrative auditing and operational difficulties of acting
                in such a way, cases might slip through the net. That is because
                the Bill carries a provision for the sharing of information.
                Without that provision, it is impossible for the Social Security
                Agency and the boards and trusts to exchange personal details
                about the preserved rights customers to ensure that everyone is
                accounted for.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill to enable the transfer is largely
                technical. It removes the current statutory bar to trusts taking
                responsibility for preserved rights cases and allows for the
                disclosure of information between the Social Security Agency and
                the boards and trusts to the extent that is necessary to ensure
                that all such cases are correctly identified.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The policy document for the Bill was first
                submitted to Sir Reg Empey and Mr Seamus Mallon last August.
                However, various delays and a request for further financial
                information meant that the Bill did not progress at the normal
                pace. That resulted in the Bill’s reaching the First Stage
                only today, which is a delay of more than four months from the
                date originally planned.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The remit of the Bill has been reduced to
                contain only those provisions that relate to the preserved
                rights transfer. Other provisions relating to nursing care costs
                and the professional body for nursing and midwifery will be
                contained in a separate Bill that will allow the normal Assembly
                procedures.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My officials met with the Committee for
                Health, Social Services and Public Safety to explain the
                background to the changes, the need for legislation and the
                circumstances that have given rise to the situation with which
                we are now faced, where accelerated passage procedure is being
                requested. While Committee members have natural reservations
                about the use of accelerated passage procedure, in this instance
                they have accepted that the need is genuine and that the
                circumstances are exceptional. I am grateful to the Committee
                members for that. Although I cannot guarantee that the need for
                accelerated passage will never arise again, I assure Members
                that the circumstances of this Bill are exceptional, and I do
                not anticipate encountering them again.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Standing Order 40 permits a Bill to proceed,
                using accelerated passage, with the leave of the Assembly.
                Accordingly, I seek the leave of the House to proceed with
                accelerated passage on the Personal Social Services (Preserved
                Rights) Bill.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for Health,
                Social Services and Public Safety (Dr Hendron):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee has considered the Minister of
                Health’s request for accelerated passage for the Personal
                Social Services (Preserved Rights) Bill. The Committee takes its
                responsibilities seriously and was concerned by the need to
                grant a public Bill accelerated passage, as that denies members
                the opportunity to scrutinise the Bill in detail during the
                Committee Stage. There is always a danger that bad legislation
                might be enacted if a Committee does not have the chance to
                consider the detail of a Bill. However, the Committee has
                questioned the Minister’s officials about the reasons for the
                Bill and about the need for accelerated passage. Today the
                Minister told Members why new arrangements need to be put in
                place to manage the care of people with preserved rights and why
                the Bill needs to be in place by the end of April.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill deals with equity of treatment for
                residents of independent residential and nursing homes with
                preserved rights who, since 1993, have continued to receive
                social security funding towards their accommodation costs. Some
                1,740 vulnerable people will be affected by the changes. Because
                of the need to protect those people, the Committee accepts that
                the Bill be considered under accelerated passage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee for Health, Social Services and
                Public Safety supports the motion.</p>

                public Bill, in view of the reasons given — and in particular
                those relating to equity of treatment for patients — I have no

                the United Kingdom. We agree with that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, there has been a major departure in
                her party’s stance on accelerated passage. About six months
                ago, accelerated passage was sought in the House for the Social
                Security Fraud Bill. Of course, her party put up a different
                argument then. I draw the House’s attention to what was said
                then, and I ask the Minister to comment, now that her party’s

                that she wants accelerated passage so that we can maintain
                parity with the rest of the UK. She has also made it clear that,

                Stage. However, contrary to the beliefs of some Members — and
                I am glad that they find it so funny — 1,800 people would be
                disenfranchised if this Bill did not pass.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister outlined the reasons why she is
                asking for the Bill to be given accelerated passage. It was
                submitted six months ago, in August 2001. Through discussions
                with departmental officials, the Committee found out that there
                were problems in the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy
                First Minister. The Committee told the officials that while
                Members were not happy, they did realise why the Department
                wanted their approval for accelerated passage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must be realistic, and we must establish
                what problems the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy
                First Minister had in this matter. Why have we waited six months
                for this Bill? With that in mind, my Committee Colleagues and I
                reluctantly support the motion to grant accelerated passage, but
                you can rest assured that we will examine the Bill — we will
                not forget about it simply because it will not go through
                Committee Stage. However, we will not be party to 1,800 people
                being disadvantaged due to mismanagement by the Office of the
                First Minister and the Deputy First Minister. Go raibh maith
                agat.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Sue Ramsey rightly stated, every member of
                the Committee registered enormous concern when told that the
                legislation would require accelerated passage. This is the first
                time that our Committee has been asked to accelerate
                legislation. We were presented with several options, and it is
                correct that the 1,740 residents could be disenfranchised. The
                difficulty is that the Social Security Agency would have to
                calculate each payment manually, because, as the Minister
                stated, on 7 April 2002 the computer system will be closed down.
                When the Executive decide on legislation in the future, I
                suggest that if they do not meet their deadlines, a Minister be
                tasked to do 1,740 calculations manually. That would be the
                impact of failing to process legislation on time. We could have
                chosen to do that, but parity would have been broken — not in
                the rates but by requesting extra staff. It would be an extra
                cost to the Department for Social Development to continue that
                work after the computer system stops in Northern Ireland, as it
                will do elsewhere.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the legislation had gone through the
                Committee, Members would have asked questions on it, so it is
                important that the Minister be given the opportunity to respond
                to those questions on the Floor. If £19 million was requested
                from the budget for the transfer from the Department for Social
                Development’s budget to the Department of Health, Social
                Services and Public Safety’s budget — plus a little over £2
                million, making it £21 million in total — the concern is that
                that money would not necessarily be drawn down from the existing
                health and social services budget in future. That budget is
                under extreme pressure; all the budgets in the past year had
                easements or surrenders, but the Department of Health, Social
                Services and Public Safety surrendered only £4·3 million,
                which is a comparatively minimal amount. The Department is in no
                position to find this money internally. I hope that because this
                is a preserved rights issue, that money will be ringfenced and
                will not come out of current Departmental resources. I want the
                Minister to assure us of that, since we are giving accelerated
                passage to the Bill.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In response to Mr Morrow’s points, every
                time that we are asked to give accelerated passage, all Members,
                particularly those who sit on the relevant Committee, should
                explain their reasons for supporting acceleration. I would be
                concerned if the Assembly were to simply give a nod to
                accelerated passage.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr William McCrea:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have listened with interest to the debate
                thus far. When anyone calls a Sinn Féin Minister to account, it
                is noticeable that his speech is called a &quot;rant&quot;. It
                has probably been noticed that the Member for West Belfast doth
                protest too much — she should stop crying. In fact, her
                bleating is false. Where is the Member who was so concerned
                about accelerated passage for the Social Security Fraud Bill —
                where is Gerry Kelly? He has disappeared. Sinn Féin has turned
                its policy on its head. I am sure that he was speaking with a
                good deal of authority, as he does when speaking for a breadth
                of organisations connected with IRA/Sinn Féin, when he said:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;I oppose the use of accelerated passage
                procedure,&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is very clear: &quot;I oppose it.&quot;</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He added:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;… and I hope that others will do
                likewise.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That was a clear statement of opposition.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, when accelerated passage is
                requested for a Bill that is supported by Sinn Féin and the
                Health Minister, that opposition goes away. My hon Friend Mr
                Morrow pointed out that there may be opposition only to the
                accelerated passage of the Social Security Fraud Bill — or
                does it go wider than that? We will find that out if Gerry Kelly
                appears before the end of the debate, or if he wants to oppose
                accelerated passage vigorously, or if Sinn Féin intends to vote
                against it. Once again there has been hypocrisy. Principle means
                absolutely nothing and is stood on its head when it suits the
                occasion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was pointed out before that it was not my
                hon Friend’s wish to use accelerated passage as normal
                procedure for a Bill but that the Social Security Fraud Bill had
                to be tackled in that way because it dealt with the serious
                matter of fraudulent activity throughout the Province.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Parity with the rest of the United Kingdom
                was established then, and I am glad that Sinn Féin is today
                stating that it wants parity with the rest of the United
                Kingdom. Sinn Féin can try to express that idea in another form
                of words, because it does not like to admit that it represents
                parity with the rest of the United Kingdom. It will be
                interesting to see whether Sinn Féin will admit that, even
                though those words seem to scorch the mouths of its members who
                utter them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is another serious matter. We have been
                told that the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First
                Minister is sitting on Bills. That is a serious matter that must
                be tackled head-on. We have been told that the Prime Minister of
                the United Kingdom, Mr Blair, has many problems at home that
                must be addressed, and yet he tours the world. The First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister have toured Brussels,
                toured America, toured everywhere, but they have not dealt with
                matters that are relevant at home. Therefore, it is not
                acceptable that the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy
                First Minister is impeding the progress of numerous Bills. I
                have heard that several other Bills have been stopped, because
                they are sitting on the desks of the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The reason for their impediment cannot be
                money, because many millions of pounds have been allocated. Its
                budget is almost as high as that for the entire Assembly, so the
                delay is not due to a lack of money. However, there seems to be
                a lack of will, and it is unacceptable that accelerated passage
                is being requested because of inaction by the Office of the
                First Minister and the Deputy First Minister. That issue must be
                scrutinised and the reasons must be smoked out. It must be
                brought out into the open.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the purpose of accelerated passage.
                It is important that there be parity with the rest of the United
                Kingdom and that our people should not be disadvantaged.
                However, Bills should not sit on the desks of the First Minister
                and the Deputy First Minister. They should be processed in a
                proper and urgent manner.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms de Brún:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Members for their interest. I will
                try to deal with all the issues raised.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, the resource transfer has been
                confirmed for 2002-03 and 2003-04, and will be subject to the
                spending review process. I assure Members that I have no wish to
                ask the House to give a Bill accelerated passage. The
                circumstances of this Bill are exceptional, and I do not
                anticipate encountering them again.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the debate, several Members referred
                to the circumstances of the delay. I want to give a fuller
                picture. On 9 August 2001, in the absence of the First Minister
                and the Deputy First Minister, I submitted the policy document
                for this Bill to Sir Reg Empey and Mr Séamus Mallon for
                approval to submit it to the Executive. A reply giving me
                approval to proceed was issued on 17 September, conditional to
                further work being completed on the financial implications. It
                is important to note that that work had to be done and was one
                element of the cause of the delay. The additional work was not
                straightforward and involved liaison and agreement with the
                Department for Social Development on the transfer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In view of the delays that had occurred since
                the policy document was first submitted, an additional paper was
                included with the revised policy document. That was resubmitted
                on 7 November, requesting approval to seek accelerated passage
                on the transfer of preserved rights cases to health and personal
                social services. Approval to prepare two Bills and to seek
                accelerated passage was received on 8 January. Approval to
                introduce the Bills to the House was sought from the Office of
                the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister and the
                Executive on 10 January. Approval from the Office of the First
                Minister and the Deputy Minister was received on 30 January, and
                Executive approval was received on 7 February.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Due to the various delays and the need for
                further financial information, that is being brought to the
                Assembly much later than we anticipated. Therefore, to avoid the
                difficulties that I outlined, we are asking for accelerated
                passage today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that I have covered all the points
                that Members raised. I apologise if I have missed any question.
                My officials will scrutinise the record of the debate, and I
                will write to any Member whose question has not been answered or
                fully covered. I thank Members again for their interest in the
                issue and the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public
                Safety for its help and support in the matter.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am encouraged by that response. By way of
                assistance, I suggest that the First Minister and the Deputy
                First Minister give serious consideration to including, in the
                single equality Bill, section 15(2) of the Equal Status Act 2000
                in the South of Ireland. That might help to alleviate the
                problem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Do the First Minister and the Deputy First
                Minister recognise the need for some degree of mediation or
                arbitration to be facilitated when there is a dispute over
                admission, rather than it ending up in court, as happens at
                present? That is unsatisfactory and somewhat expensive.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member has asked us to consider section
                15(2) of the Republic of Ireland’s Equal Status Act 2000,
                which provides an exemption from anti-discrimination law for
                action taken by, or on behalf of, those who are licensed to sell
                alcohol when they are acting in good faith to ensure compliance
                with the licensing laws. The Republic of Ireland has a general
                provision, similar to that in our current legislation, which
                provides that nothing in the Equal Status Act 2000 shall be
                construed as prohibiting any action taken under any enactment.
                When forming our proposals, we shall consider the impact of the
                exemptions in the Republic and the experiences there.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member said that he was encouraged by my
                response. We shall take those issues into account. However, that
                will not predetermine our conclusions. I do not want anything to
                be misunderstood or misrepresented. It would be wrong for me to
                speculate on any measure that might be taken on mediation at
                this stage in advance of court action. However, we accept the
                Member’s point.</p>

                opinion or disability, and does he acknowledge that there is
                concern at the number of weak cases supported by the Equality
                Commission? I understand that about 80% of such cases have been
                lost, and others have been settled out of court to avoid legal
                costs.</p>

                involvement, under the single equality Bill, in any cases that
                may be taken. We are looking at what the single equality Bill
                should provide for, and our focus should be on those legislative

                elements from creating havoc on their property? It should be
                made clear that publicans should have the right to bar anyone.
                For example, someone wearing a Celtic top who walks into a bar
                full of Rangers supporters could, and probably would, lead to a

                indicated before in the House in answers from the Office of the
                First Minister and the Deputy First Minister, the single
                equality Bill has not yet come before the House. In relation to
                the matters under discussion, we have to take account of the
                requirements under licensing legislation that publicans ensure
                good order on their premises. We want to be certain that we take
                care to ensure that there are no breaches of the peace. We also
                want to make sure that the single equality Bill will be
                effective as an equality measure and will provide for common
                sense legislation in respect of all other considerations.</p>

                Unionists there are focused on their Unionism, despite being the
                minority community in the west. Indeed, the First Minister
                should also know that, during any visits that I make to Ulster
                Unionist Party groups in West Tyrone, I and they do not waste
                our time discussing any form of united or agreed Ireland, as

                the First Minister give me an assurance that he will take time
                to address the concerns of groups representing victims of
                terrorism in the west? Republican terrorists are still actively
                targeting members of those groups.</p>

                not discussing any form of united or agreed Ireland. I was
                astonished at the claim made by a leading member of the DUP that
                that was happening. I wonder whether he has any evidence, and
                whether he would care to produce it. I dare say it is like so
                many things that we hear from that quarter — assertions
                without evidence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Victims’ groups and individual victims from
                West Tyrone have played an important role in research recently
                carried out into service provision for victims. Officials from
                our Victims Unit have visited a number of victims’ support
                groups in the area during the past year and assisted with a
                variety of issues. A capacity- building programme to help
                victims’ groups increase their expertise in seeking and
                securing funding was recently completed, and several groups in
                the area participated.</p>

                concerning constituencies. The supplementaries to those
                questions seem to bear little relation to the constituency
                concerned, which must disappoint the constituents. However,
                there is another dilemma about such questions open to the
                constituency alone. If there are only two further
                supplementaries, I am in the invidious position of
                discriminating against some Members or parties from that

                questions on constituencies, especially when they are not

                answers for likely questions. In this case we are similarly
                positioned. I have been informed by the IDB that it takes a keen

                Fabplus. The company will manufacture sprinkler systems in
                Strabane creating 30 jobs. I am sure the Member is familiar with
                the project. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment
                is focused on that, and it is one of its principal concerns.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I reject any allegation that the Office of
                the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister is in any way
                undercommitted to North/South arrangements. On previous
                occasions, we have answered questions on the institutional
                format, and we have made it clear that we are committed to
                ensuring that the North/South arrangements work in a full and
                effective way across a range of issues. Those include looking at
                — as we did in the institutional format — extending areas
                that would come under formal co-operation and, therefore, the
                accountability mechanisms that attach to the North/South
                Ministerial Council. To develop matters in those ways hardly
                implies a lack of commitment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Irish Government have considered the
                matter of honours on several occasions, going back to 1930. It
                has always been felt that any honours system could be introduced
                only on a cross-party basis. It has been the subject of
                discussion in the Dáil, including during the current session,
                and the matter is one that the Government and other parties are
                addressing. An honours system, as such, is not a matter for the
                President, and I hope that the Member recognises the
                significance of article 40 of the Constitution of Ireland,
                because I certainly do.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With respect to any other issues, our Office
                remains open, positive and encouraging to anyone interested in
                promoting activities in, or participation from, Northern
                Ireland.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am speaking as an Irish nationally- minded
                citizen — that is honour enough in itself, and I seek no
                further reward or award. However, does the Minister agree that
                there is a place for a system to recognise the efforts of
                citizens on this island — their efforts to improve the quality
                of life and to create an egalitarian society — but that in the
                past some of those honours and award systems have been abused,
                and have been used solely to award the great and the good and
                the rich and the powerful? Any future system should recognise
                that even modest efforts by people throughout society provide a
                rich and powerful contribution to the cause of peace, prosperity
                and stability in the country.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Republican and socialist tradition has
                been to oppose any system that might extend privilege or
                patronage. However, many people realise that it is appropriate
                to find ways to recognise contributions made to society. Many
                countries, including republics, have systems that recognise
                citizens’ outstanding contributions and dedication.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Should the Irish Government introduce a
                system to recognise and reflect such contributions, many in the
                House and elsewhere would be happy to welcome that move. From
                another perspective, many people appreciate honours that are
                conferred differently.</p>

                spending review 2002, which will culminate in whatever decisions
                the Chancellor makes in the summer, is crucial. The Assembly
                would regard the Executive as highly remiss if they did not
                consider the matter, the approaches that they will make and the
                preparations for it. Moreover, the Assembly would regard the

                Secretary of State called for Sinn Féin to join the Northern
                Ireland Policing Board, discussed the aforementioned issue? Does
                he agree that the absence of Sinn Féin from the Policing Board
                has enabled discussions to proceed without the poison that that
                party normally injects into public bodies, which makes it hard
                to reach resolutions on difficult issues? Will he tell the House

                operated so far and with the broad party consensus that exists
                on it among the Member’s party, the SDLP and my party. We all

                Environment, the strategic framework for the preservation of the
                cultural heritage of the whole of Northern Ireland. At a local
                level, the cultural forum that my Department established to
                bring together a range of relevant public bodies has already

                the River Bush.</p>

                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department has been aware for some time
                of concerns over the decreased number of salmon returning to the
                river as a result of the reduction in the numbers of adult fish
                returning to spawn in the river. That reflects a general trend
                of falling stocks across the north Atlantic.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several measures have been pursued in the
                last few years to increase stocks, and more are planned this
                year. First, the river will be stocked annually with hatchery-
                reared smolts. Those ranch salmon provide good angling on the
                lower stretches of the river, although they are not allowed to
                migrate upstream to spawn, as they may detrimentally affect the
                international salmon research project that is being undertaken
                on the river.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, a programme of increased in-river
                stocking with hatchery-reared salmon fry and parr is scheduled
                to commence in spring 2002. That will yield increased numbers of
                smolts going to sea, which should increase the number of adult
                fish returning to the river.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thirdly, the marine survival of salmon is a
                major concern. To help to address that locally, I recently
                obtained £1·5 million from the Executive programme fund for a
                voluntary scheme to buy out coastal commercial salmon netting
                entitlements. That should increase the number of adult fish
                returning to Northern Ireland river systems, including the River
                Bush.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, a river warden has been recruited
                specifically for the River Bush to tackle poaching problems and
                to assist in upgrading habitat to provide additional spawning
                opportunities for returning fish. Those measures show that the
                Department is implementing major measures to increase stocks in
                the River Bush.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Kane:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Are the interests of tourism, the River Bush
                or anglers served by scientists continuing to develop fin clip
                numbers between Bushmills hatchery and the river mouth, whilst
                continuing to neglect the restocking of the river to any
                significant degree by introducing wild salmon fry?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1983-84, wild salmon stocks in the River
                Bush were at a record low. Could the actions that were taken to
                correct the situation then be employed now, as stocks are at an
                all-time low, just as they were in 1983?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although I do not have the exact figures for
                1983, I know that stocks, particularly wild salmon, are
                declining. Several measures are in place to try to address that,
                of which buying up nets is one. The continuous angling
                development programme, which follows on from the salmon
                enhancement programme, is designed specifically to carry out
                improvements in the habitat. The salmon management plan, a
                scientific programme that sets spawning targets in the catchment
                area to ensure that the spawning levels are maintained, is a
                further relevant measure. There are also restrictions on
                exploitation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Bag limits have been introduced. From 1 June
                2002 until the end of the season, a limit of two fish a day will
                be permitted. Prior to that, all fish caught will be returned. I
                mentioned the role of the warden on the river. There is also the
                River Bush project, which is an internationally- renowned
                scientific project to examie the marine survival of salmon. The
                River Bush is used as an index river in that project. A great
                deal of work is ongoing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those measures are designed to address a
                combination of factors, which means that wild salmon stocks are
                reducing. It is estimated that they have reduced by around 50%.
                That fills us with concern, and we want to address the matter.
                However, the unknown factor of the ability of salmon to survive
                in the north Atlantic is outside our control. Evidence suggests
                that matters such as temperature increases and pollution are
                also having a seriously adverse effect.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Leslie:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s initiative to
                support the salmon population. He will be aware that a slurry or
                silage effluent spill can undo much good work with one blow.
                Several technological advances have been made in the
                reprocessing of farm waste. Would the Minister’s Department
                support initiatives advanced by the farming community to
                introduce some of those methods in Northern Ireland?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The short answer is yes. It is no secret that
                pollution presents a major problem, not only in the numbers of
                fish that are killed but in the damage that it causes to the
                habitat. The Department would support all reasonable measures
                proposed by the farming industry or by any sector to deal with
                slurry waste entering and polluting the river systems.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a positive note, no fish were killed in
                the River Bush last year. However, as Mr Leslie is aware, other
                rivers were not so fortunate.</p>

                given to AQO 420/01 on 26 November 2001, and repeat that darts
                has not so far been recognised as a sport, on the grounds that
                it involves insufficient physical activity. Recognition per se
                would not lead to funding; it would simply allow access to

                some games a ball is thrown; a punch is thrown in boxing, and
                those are recognised sports. Dart players throw darts. Should

                hands. The sports councils of Northern Ireland, England,
                Scotland and Wales come together and determine whether a sport
                is recognised. They have met several times to discuss the issue
                of darts, and each time, darts has been recognised as a game, a
                pastime or a hobby — but not as a sport. The game is played in
                any pub in the land and it is enjoyed by many. However, the
                central thrust seems to be that a sport has access to lottery
                funding. I reiterate that an activity’s recognition as a sport
                does not guarantee its funding. There are other criteria, not

                sponsorship of motorcycling to be eliminated. However, I
                recognise that the sport needs that advertising and sponsorship
                to survive. Unfortunately, alternative sponsorship is rare, and
                that is why motorcycle sport continues to rely almost
                exclusively on tobacco sponsorship.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Responsibility for any decision to ban or
                restrict tobacco advertising and sponsorship in sport lies with
                the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety.
                Although I have not had any discussions with Minister de Brún,
                I know that a private Member’s Bill that will extend to

                sponsorship and his dealings with the Minister of Health, Social
                Services and Public Safety disappoint me. I specifically
                mentioned motorcycling because of that sport’s recent
                acceptance of sponsorship from the tobacco industry. My concern
                applies to all sports that accept sponsorship from that source.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tobacco sponsorship has all but disappeared,
                and motorcycling is the last sport to avail of it. I would
                support a ban on tobacco advertising, provided that there were
                some lead-in time to allow the sport to seek alternative
                funding. As things stand, if a ban were introduced tomorrow,
                that would have a major effect on motorbike racing; for example,
                short- circuit motorbike racing would face great difficulties
                and could disappear.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Westminster Government introduced a Bill
                to ban all tobacco advertisement and sponsorship by July 2003.
                That Bill was overtaken by the general election. However, the
                private Member’s Bill, which replicates the Government’s
                Bill, is working its way through Westminster. It will set a
                deadline of October 2006 for the ban of all tobacco advertising.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Government’s original Bill had
                derogations for snooker and Formula 1 racing. We do not have
                Formula 1 racing in Northern Ireland, and little snooker is
                played. The private Member’s Bill would end the derogations.
                Therefore, the Member has referred to a process that is already
                under way and that may take care of the problem that he
                identified. If it does not, the issue can be debated again in
                the House. However, it is a matter for central legislation. It
                is important to have a standardised means of addressing such
                issues in the United Kingdom.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would support — and I doubt whether
                anyone in the House would oppose — such a ban.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been no formal contact with either
                Scotland or the Republic of Ireland at ministerial level on this
                issue. This is a matter for the football authorities concerned,
                and the Irish Football Association (IFA) has consistently
                indicated that it has no plans to seek involvement in a joint
                bid because of the lack of suitable facilities. Given those
                circumstances, it would have been inappropriate for me to
                intervene.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The establishment of a national stadium is a
                key issue that is central to such a bid and to the development
                of a soccer strategy in Northern Ireland. Following the end of
                the strategy’s consultation period on 31 January, I will
                consider the issue more closely with the other sports that may
                be involved.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is disappointing that nothing is happening
                at this stage. Does the 2008 championship not represent what is
                possibly the last opportunity to get a national stadium under
                way in Northern Ireland? Given the affection that Members on the
                Minister’s side of the House have for Scotland, and the
                affection that Members on the other side of the House have for
                the Republic — although some follow Glasgow Celtic — is it
                not time that we made the most of the opportunity to join with
                the bid that is being submitted by the two other football
                associations?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, I do not regard this as the last
                chance to establish a national stadium. It would not be right to
                expend considerable sums of money and resources that we do not
                have simply to race to join in with a soccer tournament. The IFA
                is football’s governing body, and this matter is its
                responsibility. The Scottish Football Association (SFA)
                approached the IFA, which stated that it was unable to make a
                joint bid because it did not have the adequate facilities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The criteria for the bid must also be
                considered. Eight stadiums, each with 30,000 seats, are
                required. Scotland would provide six stadiums; it already has
                four stadiums and it will upgrade a further two. The Irish
                Republic, which is joining the bid, would provide two stadiums.
                The last date for joining the bid is the end of February, so the
                timescale has been too tight. In addition to that, while I do
                not wish the bid to fail, there is no guarantee that the joint
                bid by Scotland and the Irish Republic will succeed in 2008.
                They face stiff competition.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This opportunity will arise every four years.
                We will become better informed as to how to make progress
                through the process of considering the establishment of
                stadiums, the soccer strategy, and the needs of other sports,
                whose strategies will help us to determine their needs. A
                substantial investment would be needed. A brand-new
                30,000-seater stadium would cost some £60 million. The cost of
                land and site works, and running costs of about £2 million a
                year would be added to that. The refurbishment of the existing
                Windsor Park and support for other existing stadiums would be a
                much cheaper option.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must ask the sports involved whether this
                is how they would want us to spend £60 million. Refurbishment
                seems to be the best way to achieve such facilities at the
                lowest cost, while dealing with the needs of the sports
                involved. This matter involves football, but it also concerns
                rugby, Gaelic football and athletics. Those sports’ long-term
                needs must also be addressed.</p>

                the difficulties that the Department is facing, and as a
                goodwill gesture, will the Minister consider inviting the
                increasingly successful Republic of Ireland World Cup team on a
                courtesy visit to Northern Ireland to promote some of the work
                that we are trying to achieve through the soccer strategy?</p>

                Football Association (IFA), but I will certainly take the
                suggestion on board and will discuss that matter with the IFA.
                The IFA is constantly looking for international teams to visit
                Belfast. The facilities at Windsor Park preclude some teams from
                playing here, but the hosting of major international matches at
                Windsor Park is the best and surest way to ensure that the
                Northern Ireland team reaches the required standard to take part
                in the next Union of European Football Associations (UEFA)

                of involving the IFA? Can he also confirm that UEFA’s rules
                clearly state that it will not accept a bid from more than two
                countries?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not aware of any such statement from the
                IFA. However, I can confirm that the IFA indicated to the
                Scottish Football Association that an expression of interest
                would be forthcoming, but that the IFA was not able to go
                forward because it considered the prospect of participating in a
                joint bid to be impractical due to the lack of appropriate
                facilities. If my understanding of the situation is wrong, I
                will try to find out more and write to the Member on the matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not believe that there is any limit on
                the number of partners in a bid. There can be more than two —
                in fact, UEFA was looking for partnership bids rather than
                single-country bids. I understand that one of the strongest bids
                being put forward for the 2004 rounds comes from Scandinavia,
                which includes Denmark, Sweden and Norway in a joint bid.</p>

                strategies are being finalised, and we must also examine the
                strategies for rugby, athletics and other interested sports.
                There is no reason to rule out the redevelopment of Windsor
                Park. The resource implications of such matters must be
                considered, and it is a question of whether it will be more
                cost-effective to invest in the refurbishment of existing
                facilities to bring them up to the required standard or to build
                new facilities — I have given you a flavour of the amount of
                money that that will involve. The redevelopment of existing
                sites will probably be a much cheaper option, but that matter

                is part of the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure. It is
                looking at a standardised form of address for Government and the
                private sector, which will include townland names. We have
                received a successful bid for £1 million of funding through
                Executive programme funds to advance that scheme, which will
                mean that every address will be re-united with its townland
                name. That will happen; the next step is to collect the address
                data. It is important to recognise that townland names have
                never disappeared — they are detailed on ordnance survey maps,
                depending on the size of the map. The common address file will
                ensure that townland names are on standardised forms of
                addresses in future.</p>

                Post Office policy of giving preference to road names, a policy
                which is driven by the interests of big business and its narrow,
                selfish interests? Will his Department use its influence to have
                the Post Office change its policy, and take on board the

                with big business. As I said in my answer to Mr McElduff, a

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will be aware that no bovine animal
                of more than 30 months of age enters the human food chain.
                Regarding animals under 30 months of age, which pass both anti-
                and post-mortem examinations, all tissues that could potentially
                be infected with the BSE agent are removed. The Specified Risk
                Material Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1997, as amended,
                requires that all bovine tissues — otherwise known as
                specified risk material — that could potentially harbour the
                BSE agent are removed as soon as is reasonably practicable after
                the slaughter of the animal, immediately stained blue, and
                disposed off by rendering or by incineration at approved
                premises. All carcasses for human consumption, including
                imported carcasses, are inspected by departmental staff to
                ensure that all specified risk material has been removed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department and the Food Standards Agency
                place a high emphasis on the controls in this area of work. We
                regularly carry out audits in meat plants to ensure that all
                best practices are being followed. The results of those audits,
                which are published monthly in the UK BSE bulletin, give us a
                high level of confidence that specified risk material is being
                properly disposed of and is unable to enter the food chain.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for her comprehensive
                answer. Does she agree that maximum consumer confidence in food
                safety standards must be the priority, both in food production
                and distribution? What other measures might be in place to
                protect the consumer?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I fully recognise the importance of consumer
                confidence to the agrifood industry. However, we cannot expect
                to gain that confidence without securing the safety of our food.
                As far as beef is concerned, no bovine animal of more than 30
                months of age is permitted to enter the human food chain. That
                measure ensures that cattle that show no sign of BSE, but which
                may be incubating the disease, cannot enter the food chain. In
                addition, all specified risk material — brain, spinal cord, et
                cetera — is removed from all bovine carcasses. The
                over-30-month scheme exists to ensure the safe removal of all
                parts of bovines of more than 30 months of age from the food
                chain, in case of early incubation.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As required under EU Council regulation
                1259/99, funds raised by the application of modulation can be
                deployed only for the purposes of agrienvironment, forestation
                of our agriculture land, farmer early retirement or
                less-favoured area (LFA) support measures. There is also a
                requirement that expenditure of those moneys must be confined to
                new recipients or schemes. Therefore, in the Northern Ireland
                rural development regulation plan, modulation funds have been
                devoted entirely to agrienvironmental measures and grants for
                the forestation of agriculture land. The beneficiaries are
                landowners or farmers with a long-term lease.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of the projected receipts for modulation
                have yet to be allocated under the rural development regulation
                plan, but current EU rules dictate that farmers and landowners
                will receive those moneys too.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can a region decide what the money will be
                used for? Very few farmers have entered the countryside
                management scheme, because they do not see themselves simply as
                images for tourism through managing the hedgerows. The
                Department of Agriculture and Rural Development has devoted many
                staff and a great deal of administration costs to the scheme.
                What direct benefit will result for farmers who are deprived
                now?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Rodgers:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regions can decide within the confines of the
                allowed measures, to which I have already referred. They are
                forestation, the early retirement scheme, agrienvironment
                measures and area support measures as well as the
                non-accompanying measures, which are allowed for match funding.
                However, it can be done on a regional basis within those
                parameters.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I have already stated, all of the money
                goes to the farmers. Europe is looking towards the environment
                and moving to the second pillar of the common agricultural
                policy (CAP), which largely relates to diversification projects
                and the environment. It would be foolish for people to put their
                heads in the sand. The Department has taken great care to ensure
                that farmers are trained, informed and in a position to benefit
                from those agrienvironment measures, including countryside
                management, and I am pleased to confirm uptake for those
                schemes.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When world dairy commodity markets declined
                in 2001, my officials and I worked hard to secure increases at

                EU Management Committee meeting on 24 January, I ensured that

                VAT for the local economy, as well as employing approximately
                13,000 people, deserves to receive better treatment from the EU

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the United Dairy Farmer’s milk auction
                last week, I noted that there have been further falls in prices.
                The indications from the dairy industry are that the fall in
                prices would have been more severe if we had not secured
                increases in the export refunds. However, it is disappointing
                that those have not had a more positive impact on the market. I
                agree with the Member that it would be useful if we could get
                additional funding. I have asked my officials to review the
                market information with the industry, with a view to pressing
                for further increases in export refunds at future meetings of
                the EU Milk and Milk Products Management Committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have also supported measures to help to
                strengthen the market. For example, private storage aid for
                butterfat was brought forward by two weeks at the beginning at
                March. That is the first time that that has happened for 10
                years. Furthermore, the minimum incorporation rate for
                subsidised skimmed milk powder used in animal feed increased to
                50% on 1 January. Both of those measures have been helpful.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The transfer of wholesale milk quota between
                regions of the United Kingdom has been permissible only since 1
                April 1993. In the interim, Northern Ireland has benefited from
                the revised arrangements, with the net quota transferred to
                Northern Ireland each year ranging between 13 million and 63
                million litres. That has helped to improve the structure of
                dairy farms in Northern Ireland. It has not had any adverse
                impact on the prices paid to producers for their milk.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A reduction in the prices received by
                producers in recent years has stemmed first from the strength of
                sterling, which has been acknowledged by the payment of
                agrimonetary compensation to dairy farmers in 2000 and again in
                2001.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The sector has recently faced a weakening of
                the international markets on which the Northern Ireland industry
                relies heavily, and there have also been reductions in export
                refunds. My officials and I have been working hard to secure an
                increase in export refunds in the hope that that will improve
                prices paid to consumers.</p>

                did so to help improve the structure of their farm business and
                farm income from the point of view of scale. Had they not done
                so, their businesses would not have remained viable. The
                additional quota has also benefited the milk-processing sector
                by maintaining and generating employment, and by enabling the
                sector to use its assets more efficiently. On the whole it has
                been beneficial, and we are not any worse off for having the

                30-day standstill. Other cattle and pigs in the herd will no
                longer be subjected to a standstill period. The current 20-day

                tuberculosis and brucellosis cases in Northern Ireland. That
                would reduce the amount of compensation paid, and would also

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The 30-day standstill period for the movement
                of cattle and pigs reflects the residency period for
                intracommunity trade. It is necessary to reflect the shared
                desire in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland to
                control the spread of a range of animal diseases. Some animal
                diseases — unlike foot-and- mouth disease — have a 30-day
                incubation period. That is the reason for the 30-day standstill

                order to enhance future prosperity, it is vital that the
                industry focuses on the development of high value-added dairy
                products. To this end my Department has supported several
                projects under the EU processing and marketing grant scheme to

                a role in the short term, developing value-added products with
                alternative uses, which will increase dairy farmers incomes,
                will be vital in the long term?</p>

                matter of opinion. There is now a need to restructure the
                industry and to take whatever steps we can to assist it,
                including processing and marketing grants that help develop
                those products. The industry accepts the need for structural
                change in the long term, with more emphasis being placed on
                value-added products, and possibly some rationalisation, in

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are valid arguments for reform,
                including the competitiveness of European Union products,
                environmental concerns, the level of stability of farm incomes,
                budgetary constraints and the &quot;Berlin ceiling&quot;, and
                trade and enlargement considerations. All those elements mean
                that there will be change. We must be able to manage that
                change.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must try to ensure that whatever reform
                takes place is on a scale and at a pace that does not put
                unacceptable pressure on farmers, and that it will not cause
                problems for the viability of the rural economy and rural
                communities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are social and narrow economic issues
                to be considered. I have been making those points. We want no
                isolation or marginalisation in rural communities, and we do not
                wish to create a situation whereby rural communities may
                &quot;fall off the edge&quot;. Due to the nature of our industry
                and the number of small farms in Northern Ireland, it is
                extremely important that the pace of change can be absorbed and
                the farming community can be sustained through it. We must make
                the important point that change is coming and is inevitable.
                However, we must manage that change.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My next formal meeting with Mr Walsh will be
                at the North/South Ministerial Council agriculture sectoral
                meeting, which will take place in April. Our agenda will include
                items such as animal and plant health research and development,
                issues of mutual interest linked to CAP reform, WTO negotiations
                and cross-border rural development. In the interim, I may
                contact Mr Walsh on an informal basis if issues arise that

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for her detailed answer.
                Does she agree that a single island agricultural economy offers
                the best future prospects for the farming community and
                industry, North and South?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Mr McElduff for his question. Within
                the remit of the North/South Ministerial Council there is
                recognition by Minister Walsh and myself that in many areas —
                such as animal health — a North/ South all-island strategy
                could be useful. Regardless of political positions or
                persuasions, that is recognised across the community as being
                beneficial to everyone and threatening to no one. There are
                common agriculture priorities on the island. It makes common
                sense to work together through the North/South Ministerial
                Council to co-ordinate our activities and efforts when they can
                benefit the people of Ireland as a whole.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Department recently launched the Farming
                Today in the LFA training programme for farmers in less-favoured
                areas. The programme, which has been designed in partnership
                with the industry and funded under the Programme for Government,
                contains two elements — good farming practice and good
                business sense. Both elements are delivered locally and have a
                practical workshop style closely linked to the needs of
                participants. The good farming practice element is designed to
                help farmers in less-favoured areas meet new environmental
                obligations that are a condition of LFA and agrienvironment
                support payments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those payments are worth approximately £30
                million annually to the local agriculture industry, and failure
                to follow good farming practice puts the payments at risk. The
                Farming Today in the LFA programme is now open for business and
                is attracting considerable interest from the farming community.
                To date, approximately 3,000 farmers have registered to
                participate in one or more elements of the training programme.</p>

                industry to meet today’s challenges and to adapt to the needs
                of the future. Although the good farming practice programme
                cannot be delivered through the rural portal, it will be used to
                make information available on both elements of the Farming Today

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am grateful for the opportunity to recount
                the experiences of my constituents, who have lived through three
                years of hell, suffering attack after attack by so-called
                Loyalist paramilitaries. Those attacks have at times been
                sustained and at other times spasmodic, depending on the mood of
                the thugs who carry them out.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am pleased that David McClarty is on the
                Bench opposite and will also contribute to the debate. I thank
                him for his unequivocal support and leadership during that
                period — no ifs, no buts and no excuses, and that is the way
                it should be. Any politician who finds excuses for terror groups
                who commit crimes against innocent people have nothing to
                contribute to the development of democracy. In simple terms,
                they are a sad bunch.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">More than 200 attacks have taken place over
                the past three years. Some of the attacks were minor, but
                nevertheless they have been a living nightmare for the victims.
                Other attacks have been very serious: unexploded pipe bombs by
                the dozen, pipe bombs exploding in living rooms, and gunfire
                accompanying pipe bomb attacks. Public houses have been shot up
                and have been burnt out. Over the past two years, there have
                been 55 pipe bomb attacks alone, with a catalogue of incidents
                involving murder, attempted murder, pipe bombs, intimidation and
                so forth. The majority of those attacks were against Catholics,
                and were carried out in the name of Protestants, without their
                approval. Those carrying out the outrages have no mandate from
                anyone and not only have they hurt the Catholic community
                grievously, they have offended the Protestant community, which
                wants no part of their evil doing and has said so time and time
                again. Attacks have not been exclusively against Catholics.
                Anyone who gets in the way of these people is fair game, with at
                least one Protestant family in exile because it dared to stand
                up to them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The police have had recent success against
                these evil elements, and I hope that there will be many more. In
                2000, eight searches were carried out; 20 people were arrested
                and six charged. In 2001, the number of searches doubled to 16;
                18 people were arrested and nine charged. I am sorry that such
                success did not come sooner because many children have been
                traumatised by the violence used against their families. The
                impact of this sustained campaign has been psychologically
                devastating, and the mental agony cannot be quantified. The
                fallout will go on for years and may well have ruined the
                educational potential of the victims. It has damaged their
                personalities and everything that makes them individuals in
                their own right. &quot;Suffer little children…&quot;.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the meantime, those behind these attacks
                lead comfortable lifestyles, developing legitimate businesses,
                feathering their nests, laundering their ill-gotten gains and
                setting themselves up as mandarins with power over whole
                communities. Surely it is time to bury the Mexican spaghetti
                western images of the past, when hard men entered towns and told
                people to leave or they would be shot before dawn.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Housing Executive has the responsibility
                to make safe the homes of those who are attacked. It has fitted
                deadlocks to doors and, on occasions, replaced glass with safety
                material capable of stopping pipe bombs. The Housing Executive
                could have done so much more if it had been permitted. Too
                often, families have been offered alternative accommodation in
                areas known to be more dangerous than those out of which they
                were intimidated. Why should families that have committed no
                crime, been found guilty of no offence and that have hurt no
                one, have to leave their homes and flee to England for safety?
                That is a denial of a basic human right — the right to live in
                one’s own community, free from intimidation and violence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On occasion it has been suggested that this
                is the work of a criminal element with no affinity to any known
                organisation. Such an explanation may well satisfy the
                consciences of some, but the pattern of events shows that the
                attacks have been highly organised and switched on and off at
                will as the situation demands.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the number of attacks reached epidemic
                proportions more than a year ago, church representatives in the
                Coleraine area spoke out in the strongest of terms against them.
                The community as a whole expressed its opinion loudly and
                clearly. The police issued an eight-point plan to deal with the
                situation. Attacks ceased for a considerable period, but they
                started up again, focused largely on Gaelic sports clubs and
                culminating in the death of a young man who, it is believed,
                died when handling a deadly device. He was less than twenty
                years of age, little more than a child. The young person had
                been lured into an organisation with nothing to offer anyone,
                irrespective of which community he or she comes from. Since then
                there have been no attacks, but there have been death threats
                and one attempted murder. People are on edge, not knowing when
                these evil people might be successful in claiming yet another
                life.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No one believed that it would be easy to come
                out of 30 years of violence. There might even be complacency;
                because people are no longer dying in their dozens on the
                streets of our cities and towns — Omagh excepted. We cannot
                allow ourselves to become complacent, and we cannot afford to
                allow terror groups to dictate law and order, to decide where
                people can and cannot live or to adjudicate on whether people
                should live or die. We cannot have a situation in which brave
                witnesses, who are prepared to give information to the police,
                are intimidated and forced to withdraw their statements and tell
                the warlords that they will not do it again. Too much has been
                gained, and too much has gone into the peace process to allow
                that to become the norm. If we do, there is a real risk that the
                opponents of the peace process will use such activity as an
                excuse to consolidate their negative thinking and bankrupt
                policies. The terrorists want that. Then they are free to go on
                lining their pockets with the proceeds of peddled drugs,
                laundered fuel, cheap cigarettes, protection money and all the
                other schemes that they have devised to get rich on the back of
                a beleaguered community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Coleraine, and well beyond, there is a
                determination not to let the law of the jungle prevail. There is
                genuine desire to ensure that good triumphs over evil; trust
                overcomes fear; and happiness replaces the pain that has been
                felt by so many over the last 30 years. We must build on that,
                encourage it and reward the good people, many of whom work in
                voluntary community groups with meagre resources. Given
                encouragement and leadership we can chart a new beginning. We
                are doing just that, but the message must be sent out time and
                again that the days of the bully boys are over.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Irrespective of what community they claim to
                represent, there must be no future for the men of violence or
                the opportunities that they crave to divide people on a
                sectarian basis. Those opportunities must be removed forever. It
                is surely time to step out into the no-man’s-land in the
                divided community, to take risks for peace and to be brave and
                not afraid of setbacks or of displeasing some people in the
                process. It is time to put away the graffiti brushes, replace
                the murals of anger with messages of love and to build bridges
                of trust, rather than so-called peace walls.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Coleraine, good people are determined to
                put the past behind them. However, that will not happen without
                leadership from the politicians, action from the police,
                initiatives from community leaders and direction from the
                Assembly. From now on there must be more to unite us than to
                divide us. As the peace process gains momentum, no one must be
                left behind.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The innocent families who have yet to
                experience the benefits of the peace process that has so much to
                offer everybody, must not be left on the platform of despair,
                abandoned and alone. That would undermine the very essence of
                the Assembly, which is encouraging equality for all in every
                respect. There is renewed hope and determination to shake off
                the images of the past. Above all, there is a realisation that
                success can only be achieved by partnerships built on a solid
                foundation of trust, based on respect for differences and
                acceptance of diversity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The hard men who have done so much to hurt
                people and damage the image of Coleraine have nothing to
                contribute. In most cases the godfathers do not live in the
                local community but direct their campaign of terror from outside
                it. It is time for the authorities to reel them in and to allow
                the ordinary, decent people to continue the long haul to
                permanent peace and political and economic stability.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McClarty:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was born and raised in Coleraine, and I
                have lived in the town all my life, except for a brief sojourn
                in another area of the Province. Coleraine borough has always
                prided itself on its many wonderfully positive attributes: its
                geographical position on the north coast, its many natural
                attractions and tourist amenities, and its excellent record of
                good community relations. Coleraine was fortunate to have been
                spared the worst of the troubles that have afflicted the
                Province for the last 30 years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today, the community in Coleraine, for the
                most part, remains united against violence, bigotry and
                intolerance. That is why it is regrettable that this debate
                exposes the negative elements that exist in the town, which seek
                to drag the people of Coleraine in a direction in which they
                have no wish to be taken.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately, the image of intolerant,
                violent and thuggish behaviour raises too often its ugly head
                from the gutter of society. Despite all the positive aspects of
                Coleraine, there is no point in disguising the fact that
                sinister sectarian and non-sectarian behaviour permeates the
                majority of law-abiding residents.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All such behaviour is sickening, senseless
                and reeks of bigoted intolerance. That intolerance is directed
                against religion, race and even age. It is worrying that the
                non-sectarian attacks that we increasingly hear about on our
                streets, including Coleraine’s, appear to be more senseless
                than ever before. Often they are unprovoked and without the
                slightest shred of justification.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last week I searched the BBC News website for
                all the news stories associated with Coleraine. I was shocked by
                the litany of reports of pipe bomb attacks, shootings, assaults,
                robberies, stabbings and deaths all of which bore headlines such
                as &quot;Arrests after girl, 11, shot&quot;, &quot;Loyalists
                blamed for pipe bomb attacks&quot;, &quot;Shots linked to
                feud&quot;, &quot;Armed robbery at restaurant&quot;, &quot;Man
                injured after attack by gang&quot;, and &quot;Man wounded in
                shooting&quot;. The list continues. There is little doubt that
                over the past few years Coleraine has had more than its fair
                share of paramilitary and non-sectarian incidents. People have
                the right to live peacefully, walk safely and sleep securely in
                their homes. Those rights are basic in other democracies. Here,
                however, they elude too many people too much of the time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What should be the response to those
                incidents and threats? I have a couple of suggestions to make.
                First, murderous sectarian attacks, for example, pipe bombings,
                shootings and beatings, are often carried out because the
                narrow-minded perpetrators justify their actions as being
                carried out on behalf of their community. Those actions resonate
                with their superficial sense of justice. Much good work is going
                on in Coleraine, as in other towns in the Province, to try to
                break down the community fences that have been reinforced over
                many years. Young people from both traditions must learn that
                their violent actions are self-defeating and purposeless,
                serving only to destroy their own community. They must get to
                know the &quot;other side&quot;, and make it a friend rather
                than an enemy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, in both sectarian and non-sectarian
                attacks the culprits feel little fear. Their attitude appears to
                be &quot;chances are we will get away with it, so what have we
                got to lose?&quot; The Assembly must restore to the minds of
                criminals the realisation that justice will eventually catch up
                with them. The wider community has always had a large part to
                play in that. Support for the police is vital, and everyone must
                be encouraged to tell them what they know about a crime.
                Furthermore, the police must be active on the ground and be seen
                to be so. That restores a community’s confidence in law and
                order and gives a sense of security, both of which are now at a
                low ebb. Attacks on homes and on people are to be condemned
                outright. Criminals, thugs and the paramilitaries must learn the
                difference between right and wrong and should be punished
                accordingly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am pleased to say that Coleraine remains a
                pleasant place in which to live and work. Many problems are not
                unique to the town, or, indeed, to the Province. That is no
                excuse for ignoring the trauma that families experience after an
                attack. Nor is it an excuse for not finding adequate solutions
                to the problems that we face. Members must endeavour to play a
                part, to find ways to resolve the intractable problems that are
                associated with narrow-minded bigotry — the attacks on homes,
                the pipe bombings and shootings and the senseless, thuggish
                behaviour that is endemic in a mindless few. Unfortunately, it
                is a continuing task. However, for evil to succeed it requires
                men and women of good will to do nothing. I and other elected
                representatives in the area pledge ourselves to continue the
                work of reconciliation.</p>

                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Campbell:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I join the two Members in universal and
                unequivocal condemnation of the acts of violence in the
                Coleraine area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Two basic underlying themes should be the
                cornerstone of our approach to acts of violence, from any
                source. They should be the cornerstone from the beginning of
                what is euphemistically called &quot;our troubles&quot; to date,
                and in the future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One cornerstone, which is apparent today, is
                that there should be absolute condemnation of, and unequivocal
                opposition to, violence. For my party and myself, that has
                always been the case. I am thankful that it has been the case
                for most in our society for 30 years. However, it has not always
                been the case with some in our society, as some have declined to
                condemn acts of violence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To merely condemn the violence is, however,
                insufficient. Some have refused to condemn it, and continue to
                do so. Some condemn violence, but go no further. The two
                principles are unequivocal condemnation and support for all the
                institutions that try to bring to justice those responsible for
                the violence. That has not always been the case either.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Across Northern Ireland — and in some parts
                of Coleraine, but, I am thankful to say, not too many — there
                has almost been a pick-and-choose mentality towards those two
                fundamental themes. I hope that those two principles will soon
                be cornerstones for everyone. I hope that one day soon we will
                not only unequivocally condemn violence, but unequivocally
                support the police and other institutions that are responsible
                for bringing the perpetrators of violence to justice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have outlined my approach to the violence
                in Coleraine. Two of my East Londonderry Colleagues, Mr McClarty
                and Mr Dallat, mentioned that many of the incidents have left
                families bewildered, angry, concerned and fearful. As the Member
                of Parliament for the area, I have had cause to visit many of
                the families to try to be of assistance, as have other Assembly
                Members and local councillors. It is difficult to help at those
                times, because people want an assurance that such incidents will
                not happen again. It is difficult for public representatives to
                give that assurance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is only when the two cornerstones are in
                place, and everyone, from all sections of the community, is
                united in condemning violence, and equally united in supporting
                the forces of law and order to bring people to justice, that
                some confidence can be given to the victims that their nightmare
                might be nearing an end.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further to my general point and my expression
                of support for the families who had to suffer the attacks, I
                will make an analysis of the current problem. It would be much
                easier to simply condemn the attacks, to ask everyone to support
                the police in pursuing the people responsible and to leave it at
                that. If I did that, there would undoubtedly be knowing nods not
                only from all around the Chamber but from those who subsequently
                read the comments in Hansard. However, I would be doing myself
                an injustice if I left it at that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 2002 in Coleraine, as in other areas,
                there is frustration in parts of the community that police
                numbers have been so affected by the implementation of the
                Patten Report that violence is much more difficult to detect. It
                is felt that it is much more difficult to apprehend the
                criminals because of the Patten Report, because police stations
                are under threat and because police numbers are being reduced.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many people in the Coleraine area and across
                Northern Ireland are at a loss to understand how on the one hand
                there is public hand-wringing and condemnation of violence,
                while on the other there is support for the reduction in the
                numbers of police who are trying to deal with that violence. We
                must therefore examine ways to beef up the numbers of available
                personnel and to provide more resources for the police to ensure
                that criminal activities cease.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other Members referred in various ways to
                some of those activities. Many attacks have been nakedly
                sectarian. Some have been against innocent Catholics, some
                against innocent Protestants. Others have been nothing to do
                with religion at all. The last couple of weeks saw the first
                anniversary of the death of an elderly man whose murder in
                Coleraine town centre appeared to be the result of mindless
                violence with no religious or political overtones whatsoever.
                There have been attacks on a variety of people in the Coleraine
                area for a multiplicity of reasons.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the environment and atmosphere
                created not only in Coleraine but across Northern Ireland by
                political institutions that command neither the consent nor the
                support of the Unionist community leave a breeding ground for
                violence in parts of that community that I and others have to
                combat. We have to pressurise, lobby, argue and persuade people
                that the way to address those issues is by the democratic route
                and not through violence, its promotion or its support. That
                becomes increasingly difficult when every opportunity has been
                taken to make the point to the First Minister and the Deputy
                First Minister, the Secretary of State, or to the Prime Minister
                in the House of Commons, that we need a system of government in
                Northern Ireland that we can all support, and they have simply
                dismissed that and have said that they will proceed with the
                Belfast Agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is more and more difficult to reason and
                argue with elements of the Unionist community and to tell them
                that the democratic route is the only way to make changes to the
                system. Unfortunately, that means that the difficult task must
                continue. I will not be dissuaded. I will argue, lobby,
                campaign, persuade and pressurise every element in my community
                that is open to persuasion to ensure that in this Assembly, in
                local councils and districts, in Westminster and anywhere else a
                forum is available to establish a properly accountable system of
                government with proper consent and support in our community. It
                will not be achieved by throwing pipe bombs or by carrying out
                acts of violence. That is reprehensible; it should be condemned
                and it must cease. I hope that it will.</p>

                Mr Campbell’s analysis of what has happened in Coleraine and
                other parts of the community is hard to reconcile. He said that
                the violence occurred because there was no democracy. I find his
                attitude, particularly towards recent events in Coleraine,
                ambivalent, ambiguous and, in that context, inappropriate for an
                elected representative. He chooses to call it the Loyalist
                community or the Unionist community, but it is not the Loyalist
                community or the Unionist community in its entirety. Those in
                that community who are responsible for the attacks are those who
                continue to oppose the concept, ideas and democracy of the Good
                Friday Agreement. The last Member who spoke suggested that those
                who attacked innocent Catholics and Nationalists were motivated
                by their opposition to the Good Friday Agreement. That is
                unacceptable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Built into that is a sectarianism that has
                nothing to do with the Good Friday Agreement. It has nothing to
                do with the issues that the last Member raised. He said that
                over the past 30 years his party attempted to reduce sectarian
                tensions; we know the contrary to be the case. It has used the
                long spoon to sup with Loyalist paramilitaries from his
                community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Mr Dallat knows, sectarianism does not
                affect Coleraine alone. It exists in south Derry also.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Kelly, I must remind you that the wording
                of the Adjournment debate is specific. It refers to attacks on
                families in Coleraine. Irrespective of which side of the House,
                I advise you not to deviate from that.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The previous Member to speak strayed a
                remarkable distance from the issue of attacks in Coleraine.
                However, these attacks are endemic in Coleraine and in other
                parts of our society. Surely, the cornerstone of any society is
                a policing service that enjoys the confidence of all people. It
                is interesting that the previous Member to speak attributes many
                of the problems to the implementation of the Patten Report. Does
                he agree with the Patten Report, or does he think that it has
                not fulfilled the expectations intended of it?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Attacks that are motivated by sectarianism,
                wherever they occur, are to be condemned. Attacks on people in
                their homes because of their religion, whether Catholic or
                Protestant, are to be condemned. The ethos of political
                ambiguity and political ambivalence that create the climate in
                which such attacks are given credence must also be condemned.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I assumed that the previous Member would have
                been the last person to speak about political violence, given
                his party’s position.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Douglas:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I had not intended to speak on this subject
                today — I had not thought much about it. However, it seems in
                order that I do.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I categorically condemn all attacks on anyone
                in Coleraine, from wherever they come. I have always condemned
                such attacks and I always will. No one has the right to attack
                anyone else or their property. Mr Dallat said that the pipe-bomb
                attacks in Coleraine were carried out by Loyalists. I do not
                know whether the perpetrators were Loyalists. It is interesting
                that Mr Dallat, who supported the referendum and the Belfast
                Agreement at the last election, supported the so-called peace
                process with three Loyalists who also backed the agreement and
                the referendum. If he now says that those so-called Loyalists
                are attacking Roman Catholic people in Coleraine, something must
                have happened to have caused them to move so far apart.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was amused to hear David McClarty’s
                diatribe on how this process has damaged Coleraine. He also
                supported the Belfast Agreement. Like Mr Dallat, he stood up in
                Coleraine town hall and did his utmost to put down the RUC. I
                was there. Mr Dallat spoke briefly to attack the RUC, saying
                that they should be disbanded. He then left the meeting. David
                McClarty stayed on at the meeting and was very supportive of the
                agreement. He also said that there should be a change in the
                police force. I would have no difficulty with a change in the
                police force, provided that it were an improvement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those people worked together in the so-called
                peace process. Today, they criticise the many people in the
                Coleraine area who have tried their best to achieve the peace
                that everyone is talking about. Not much has been said about the
                Protestant people in the Coleraine area who have suffered
                attacks over the past 30 years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I know that we are not supposed to move away
                from the subject of attacks in Coleraine, but the person who was
                injured in Magilligan last week has many relatives in Coleraine.
                No mention has been made of him and of how his life has been
                destroyed. Nor has any mention been made of the way in which one
                of the Members for East Londonderry, John Dallat, used the RUC
                for his protection over the past 30 years. Many Roman Catholics
                were protected by the RUC and other security forces, and they
                should be very careful — <i>[Interruption].</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Douglas, I caution you about deviating
                from the subject of the debate. The debate concerns attacks in
                Coleraine, and is not an opportunity for an attack on Mr Dallat.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Douglas:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not attacking Mr Dallat in particular.
                We must remember that these people benefited from the protection
                of the security forces, who did their best to ensure the
                well-being of everyone in East Londonderry, which includes
                Coleraine.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we, as public representatives, are to work
                together for the peace that everyone talks about, we must be
                careful what we say in the future. We must continue to work
                together if we are to achieve peace in Coleraine and elsewhere.
                As public representatives, we need to ensure the continuity of
                the process. We cannot simply use opportunities such as this one
                to attack individuals because the proper system has not been put
                in place. I agree that we should always support fully the
                security forces. We should all have done that for the past 30
                years.</p>
