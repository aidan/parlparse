      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The Assembly met at 12.00 noon (Mr Speaker in the  Chair).</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="1"></a>Assembly Business</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Adams</strong>: On  a point of order, a Cheann Comhairle, perhaps you are aware that there was an  attack on the home of a Member last night. Although I am sensitive about not  abusing points of order, I consider this to be a very serious situation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">You may be aware that one group has threatened to kill Sinn  F&eacute;in representatives. The attack on the home of Mitchel McLaughlin and his wife  Mary Lou is the third such attack. I just want to bring that to the attention  of the Ceann Comhairle and send a message of solidarity to the McLaughlin  family and place on record our revulsion at and opposition to the attack. Go  raibh maith agat.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Ian  Paisley</strong>: Further to that point of order, Mr Speaker, we are moving into a  very difficult time. Therefore, it behoves us all to do our very best to  encourage and strengthen those who are standing out against the sort of  incident that was witnessed last night. I think that it is only right that the  House declare plainly and clearly where it stands on this issue and how those  Members who were put here by the electorate to represent them feel about that  part of the electorate that is trying to kill them and their friends.  Irrespective of politics, the basis of democracy is that we believe that people  should be elected, that they should serve, and that they should be given the  freedom to serve the people whom they have been elected to represent in this  House.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  Further to that point of order, Mr Speaker, I know that there are probably  procedural difficulties in this area, but I think that it is appropriate that  an opportunity be found in the Assembly to show a united response to that  attack and to the threat that was attached to it, and, indeed, to the threats  that were made previously against the deputy First Minister.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In recent weeks, the Assembly has shown a real unity of  purpose and determination to defend these institutions and the wider democratic  process against murderous attacks on soldiers and police officers. It is also  important that we unite to make it clear to the tendencies that are behind the  attack that, when they attack one member of the democratic process or one party  in that process they are attacking us all, and we all unite to defy them.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Further to that point of order, Mr Speaker. I join others in condemning any  attack on individuals or on property. On behalf of the Ulster Unionist Party, I  condemn all such attacks unreservedly and without equivocation, and I encourage  the wider community to co-operate with the PSNI in its investigations into any  such incidents. I wish to place that clearly on record.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that we investigate means by which these  matters can be raised under urgent matters of the day, rather than under points  of order, which is not appropriate.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>:  Further to those points of order, Mr Speaker. On behalf of my group I wish to  be associated with the sentiments that have been expressed. There is no doubt  that attacks on soldiers, police officers, elected politicians or ordinary  civilians are entirely unacceptable in this society. Each and every one of us  must resist them, wherever they come from and whoever they are aimed at. I am  pleased to add my voice to the sentiments expressed by others.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The procedure concerning matters of the day can seem very restrictive. Perhaps  the Committee on Procedures might consider the matter to allow Members to raise  such issues. I know that I speak for everyone in the House and for the public  in condemning these attacks.</p>
      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="2"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
      <p class="H4StageHeading">North/South Ministerial Council:</p>
      <p class="H4StageHeading">Transport Sectoral Format</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have received notice from the Minister for Regional Development that he  wishes to make a statement on the North/South Ministerial Council transport  sectoral format meeting.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development (Mr Murphy)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.  In compliance with section 52 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, I wish to make  the following report on the sixth North/South Ministerial Council transport  sectoral format meeting at the Curran   Court Hotel  in Larne on Friday 3 April 2009.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive were represented by the Minister of the  Environment, Sammy Wilson MP MLA, and me. The Irish Government were represented  by the Minister for Transport, Noel Dempsey TD. The Council noted progress made  since the last meeting, in May 2008, and welcomed the opportunity to meet to  discuss opportunities for cross-border co-operation on strategic transport  planning.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Council discussed the latest position on the A5  north-west gateway to Aughnacloy and the A8 Belfast to Larne road projects and  noted progress made to date. I advised the Council that development work was  progressing well on both projects. In respect of the A5 project, I was pleased  to report that I had announced the completion of the first significant  milestone &mdash; the preliminary route corridor assessment &mdash; ahead of target on 7  November 2008. Public exhibitions that illustrated several potential routes  within the preferred corridor were held during February 2009, with more than  3,000 people attending, including elected representatives and council  officials.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Roads Service anticipates that the selection of the  preferred route will be completed on target in mid-2009. I welcome the ongoing  co-operation at the cross-border interfaces, particularly the Aughnacloy to  Clontibret route. The Council also noted that the procurement process has  commenced on the project, with a view to the appointment of contractors and  designers in the autumn.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The next significant milestone will be the publication of  the draft statutory orders, which are due to be published by late 2010. In the  current economic climate, the Council noted the recent reassurance in relation  to the &pound;400 million contribution from the Irish Government and looked forward  to seeing further advancement of this unprecedented scheme in the coming  months.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I reported to the Council a similar position in relation to  the A8 project. The scheme will provide 14 kilometres of dual carriageway  between Belfast  and Larne. I advised that delivery is anticipated on a similar time frame to  that of the A5 and confirmed that the project has also achieved its first  significant milestone &mdash; the preliminary route corridor assessment &mdash; ahead of  target. The second key milestone &mdash; the preferred route &mdash; is also anticipated to  be on target for mid-summer 2009. In addition, the procurement process is due  to commence shortly.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Council noted the report commissioned by Fermanagh  District Council and Sligo County Council which analysed the need for upgrading  the N16/A4 Belfast to Sligo route. I was  pleased to report that extensive works are in progress to upgrade the A4  between Dungannon and Augher.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">More than 20 kilometres of dual carriageway are being  constructed between Dungannon and Ballygawley. A further four kilometres of  widened two-plus-one single carriageway are being built between Ballygawley and  Augher. My Department&rsquo;s investment delivery plan for roads also includes  proposals for bypasses of Enniskillen and Fivemiletown, which will further  relieve congestion and bottlenecks on that route and enhance regional journey  times. Consultants have been appointed to start development work on the  Enniskillen bypass.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The North/South Ministerial Council also noted the  publication of the Irish Department of Transport&rsquo;s smarter travel policy. My  Department is already progressing initiatives on sustainable transport and  travel. I advised the Council that officials are proactively engaged on a  sustainable transport and travel agenda and are progressing initiatives that  underline the all-Ireland dimension. The Council also agreed to the ongoing  work on a jointly-supported car-sharing website for the north-west region, with  a tentative commencement date in autumn 2009.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Ministers reviewed progress on proposals for improving the  Dublin-Belfast rail service and noted the findings from the work carried out by  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and Northern Ireland Railways since the Council&rsquo;s previous  meeting. Ministers agreed that identifying the capital and revenue funding  required to improve on the frequency of the Enterprise service remains an objective but  in the knowledge that the financial position is likely to be difficult in the  years ahead. They also agreed that in the meantime operating companies should  examine the case for reconfiguring Enterprise  trains to increase their reliability.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Ministers discussed the intention of the Irish Department  of Transport to deal with freight issues in a more integrated way through,  inter alia, preparing a specific strategy for the freight sector. The Council  also noted that the Department for Regional Development will consider issues  relating to freight in the review of the regional transportation strategy. It  was agreed that the Department for Regional Development and the Department of  Transport should work together to organise a freight forum in the latter part of  2009 involving North and South interests.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Council noted and welcomed the continuing progress on  the Irish Government&rsquo;s proposals for restoring the cross-border bridges at  Annaghroe and Knockaginney. It also acknowledged the excellent cross-border  co-operation to date that has led to formal planning approval in both  jurisdictions. Construction work will commence soon. Replacement of the bridges  will enhance cross-border links and the social and economic well-being of the  immediate areas. In relation to Narrow Water bridge, the Council noted that  Louth County Council has completed significant work and is to undertake further  appraisal of the proposed project prior to progression through the statutory  processes.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I reminded the Council that my Department&rsquo;s Roads Service  has employed consultants who have undertaken a feasibility study for a Newry  southern relief road to link the A2    Warrenpoint Road to the A1 just south of Newry. I  was recently made aware of the findings of that study, and I welcome the  continuing co-operation on the project between officials from Roads Service and  Louth County Council.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Council noted the studies carried out to date on the  Ballynacarry bridge by Monaghan County Council. The ongoing appraisal for that  bridge is expected to be completed in mid-2009, after which the authorities in  the South will further consider the level of priority to attach to the project.  Go raibh maith agat.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Regional Development (Mr Cobain)</strong>: I thank the Minister  for his statement. Will he share with Members the findings of the feasibility  study on the Newry southern relief road?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I received that report recently, but more work will  be done on developing the findings. I hope to be able to share the information  with the Regional Development Committee, elected representatives and the public  in that part of the world in the near future.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The project is important. Roads Service and the consultants  it has engaged have undertaken significant assessment work. The project is  particularly important to Warrenpoint port&rsquo;s ability to continue to grow and to  serve as an economic driver in the east coast region. As I said, I have  received some preliminary findings, which will be developed, and I will have  further discussion with officials on the matter tomorrow. We hope to be in a  position to present the report&rsquo;s findings soon.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>: I  note the Minister&rsquo;s comments about the A5. He knows that the &pound;400 million that  has been made available by the Irish authorities is guaranteed. Will he  absolutely and categorically assure Members that as a result of his meeting  there is no question or any doubt about the future of that funding?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I am happy to do so. Any time that we have raised  that issue with the Minister for Transport, we have been very forcefully  assured by the Minister, his officials and the National Roads Authority in the  South that that funding will be forthcoming. As the Member has said, it is a  very important component of not just the A5 but the A8 Belfast to Larne route.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I refer the Member to the comments of the Taoiseach during  a dinner he attended a number of weeks ago with the CBI, in which he again  reaffirmed the Dublin Government&rsquo;s financial commitment to that project. We  have been given very firm assurances at every stage at which we have enquired  about funding, and I am happy to repeat those assurances to the Member.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh r&aacute;iteas an Aire. I  welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement and draw his attention to the Ballynacarry  bridge. He is well aware of the lobbying that local councillors have done  through the East Border Region Committee (EBRC) on that matter. Arising from  the NSMC meeting, can the Minister tell us whether he feels that dealing with  the issue is a major priority? Go raibh maith agat.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I met the East Border Region Committee, and I know  that the group of councils that is represented on it is very supportive of the  INTERREG money available for the area going to the Ballynacarry bridge project.  It is on a very dangerous stretch of the route between Cullaville and  Castleblayney and has been the scene of quite a lot of accidents, so there is strong  local feeling that it is a very important project. Monaghan County Council is  conducting an assessment for the project. The council has not yet assessed its  priority status, but it intends to do that in the near future. We will have  more information at that stage.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>: I  also welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. I note that the Minister of the  Environment, Sammy Wilson, who has overall responsibility for road safety, also  attended the NSMC meeting, at which, it is my understanding, road safety was discussed.  Given the number of people who have lost their lives North and South of the  border, I understand why he was in attendance. Will the Minister therefore  explain why that issue was not included in his statement? Will he tell me what  exactly was discussed about road safety?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: A broad range of issues that fall under the DOE  headline was discussed at the meeting. Road safety is always discussed at those  meetings, and I think that all Members have an interest in the matter. The  Minister of the Environment had some issues with parts of my statement. If he  wishes to make a statement about the issues that were discussed at the meeting  that are specific to his Department, that is a matter for him. I am sure that  he will sort that out with you, Mr Speaker.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A range of other matters was discussed, including the  sharing of information on car registrations and other issues that have been  developed. As a member of the Committee for Regional Development, the Member  will know that ongoing work has been a regular feature of North/South  Ministerial Council transport sectoral meetings.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement and particularly for mentioning public  transport issues. The statement referred to progressing initiatives that  underline the all-Ireland dimension of public transport. However, after that,  the focus on public transport seemed to come down to the Dublin  to Belfast rail  link. Will the Minister outline some of the other public transport initiatives  that were discussed?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">On the Dublin to Belfast rail link, the statement also revealed that it was  agreed that operating companies should examine the case for reconfiguring the Enterprise trains to  improve their reliability. Can we have some clarification about what that  reconfiguration may mean?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: One of the items under discussion was a policy paper  on sustainable transport initiatives that the Department of Transport in the  South developed. Although my Department is doing quite a lot of work on  developing its own sustainable transport initiatives, that policy paper is a  fairly comprehensive document from which there is much to be learned. Minister  Dempsey shared with us some of the sustainable transport initiatives that are  being developed in the South.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Belfast to Dublin railway line is  obviously one very important issue, not only from a public transport  perspective but economically. It is a very important route on the island.  Although the objective remains to improve the service and its frequency, in  these difficult financial times that we face, both North and South, there is  recognition that some of the initial ideas that we had will have to sit for  some time, until the finances &mdash; capital investment and ongoing revenue investment  &mdash; are available to develop them.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The ongoing work is of a technical nature. I presume that  the Member, being an engineer, may understand it a bit better than I do. However,  I know that one of the causes of engine failure is the fact that engines are  also responsible for air conditioning and heating on trains. A separate system  will make the trains more reliable, because engines are less likely to break  down if they do not have to perform dual functions.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will endeavour to get more information on that and share  it with the Member. However, that is my understanding, as a person who is not  well versed in those matters, of what they intend to do.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bresland</strong>:  I also welcome the statement. Will there be more public consultation after the  final route for the new A5 has been selected?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: Yes. The preferred route option will be launched in  mid-2009 &mdash; I think that it may be in July &mdash; and that will be accompanied by  public exhibitions, at least in a number of areas along the way. As I said in  my statement, there was a very high level of public interest in the  announcement of the potential routes within the corridor, and 3,000 people  attended at locations such as Strabane, Omagh and Ballygawley along the way. I  anticipate that the same exercise will take place when we select the preferred  route shortly. The route will go on display in public settings where the  general public, elected representatives from the area and others who have an  interest can come along and view it. The decision will be of particular  interest to landowners whose lands and properties will be affected by the route  selected. They will have an opportunity to discuss the issue with Roads Service  and with the consultants. Therefore, there will be ongoing public consultations  on the final route for the new A5.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. I thank the Minister for the statement. During the talks  on transport and travel, was there any discussion about free travel in the  transport system North and South for the over-60s and for those who accompany  or who help people with a disability. Furthermore, as regards the  Belfast-Dublin rail link, is there any guarantee at this stage that people who  buy a ticket &mdash; in particular, people with a disability &mdash; will get a seat?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: There was specific discussion on companion travelling  and concessionary fares for those with disabilities. The Member will know that  there is a differential between what we provide in the North, which is free  travel for people aged 60 and over, and what is provided in the South, where  the age is certainly 65 and may be 66.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I know that an argument has been made for companion  travelling, but there are still disabilities for which we have not been able to  provide concessionary fares. Although we bid for some money at the start of the  budgetary period for concessionary fares, we did get resources for the  over-60s. However, there is another range of disabilities that might attract  half fares but not full concessionary fares, and should more money become  available to us we will want to ensure that all who have disabilities are  covered by concessionary fares. People will continue to make the argument for  companion travel as well.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to the people&rsquo;s ability to get seats, if there  is a particular problem arising about that, I will be very happy to raise that  service matter with Translink.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  Will the Minister assure me that none of the projects, welcome as they all are,  will impinge financially on the Dungiven bypass scheme in my constituency?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: Who said that all politics are local? That is  certainly not the intention. Last week I was in Dungiven, and we launched the  preferred route for the Dungiven bypass, which is long awaited and long  overdue, as I am sure that most people in the north-west will agree. People  have been working for some time to identify that route. More work is being done  as a result of the public consultation; there will be a more detailed design,  and then we will move into the statutory processes. As far as I am concerned,  that will not be impinged upon by any other road project.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I thank the Minister for bringing this matter forward. As regards the N16 and  A4 Belfast to Sligo route and the report  commissioned by the two councils there, a corridor identification process was  to commence. Will the Minister update us on when that will take place and when  we can get the report? Secondly, as regards the Annaghroe and Knockaginney  bridges on the Monaghan/Tyrone border, did the Minister recognise the wave of  public opposition to that work in the immediate area?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: With respect to the Member&rsquo;s second question, I know  that concerns on the issue were raised when Mrs Foster was Minister of the  Environment; indeed, those matters were discussed at the North/South  Ministerial Council meeting. Nevertheless, I am aware that there was fairly  substantial consultation in that area and a recognition that re-opening the  bridges would be a good thing. Perhaps not everyone shared that view, but that  was the general feeling. Every effort was made to ensure that the public were  consulted fully. Indeed, there was further consultation with people who had not  felt comfortable about engaging in some of the official exercises.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I do not have any further information about the route  corridor assessment. We discussed briefly the fact that Fermanagh District  Council and Sligo County Council had submitted a report on it. Obviously, we  were able to update people about our ongoing work programme, including the  Dungannon to Ballygawley and the Ballygawley to Augher road improvement schemes  and the identification of the Fivemiletown and Enniskillen bypasses. With  respect to the particular report to which the Member referred, I will endeavour  to find out what work has been carried out and get back to him.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  Mr Speaker, before I ask the Minister a question about his statement, for which  I thank him, I believe that a procedural point has arisen for you and the House  authorities to consider. The Minister indicated that a matter on which he  wanted to report was discussed at the meeting; however, he did not make that  report. Accountability and transparency are supposed to mean that, when matters  are discussed at such meetings, they should be duly reported on. It seems  bizarre that a party that very much insists on that has prevented the Minister,  through no fault of his own, reporting on the matter in question. Therefore,  the matter must be addressed, because an awkward precedent will be created if  it is allowed to stand.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Minister for what he said about the A5  north-west gateway, and I welcome his further comments about money coming from  the Irish Government. We received those commitments from the Taoiseach  privately, and I believe that they will be repeated publicly this week.  However, is the Minister concerned to ensure that every effort will be made to  expedite the delivery of that project? Although the project may not be under  financial pressure, does the Minister accept that, in the coming years, there  will be significant pressure on the transport investment strategies in the  North and the South? Is there perhaps a need for a more integrated strategy,  and will the sectors North and South begin working to that end?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: One of the objectives of the North/South Ministerial  Council meetings is to ensure a high degree of integration between the  transport sectors, and that is what we are striving towards. The A5 road  improvement scheme is a good example of that sort of approach, as is the Newry  to Dundalk link.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Over the years &mdash; not just since 2007 &mdash; excellent working  relationships have been developed between the Roads Service and the National  Roads Authority, and, out of the public spotlight, formalised working groups  have done quite a bit of careful work to ensure that there is a degree of  co-ordination and integration on cross-border transport matters. Work involving  not just roads but public transport will go on.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If the downturn continues, I have no doubt that pressure  will build on the Budget; however, we are operating and planning on the basis  that moneys that have been identified will be available to us. In the interim,  that is all that we can do.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that the Member will be pleased to hear that the  first target of the A5 improvement scheme &mdash; the announcement of the route  corridor options &mdash; was achieved ahead of schedule. I think that in July we will  be in a position to announce the preferred route for the corridor, and we will  then be able to get down to more detailed work. A significant amount of work  has been ongoing and is ahead of schedule.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As I said about the A6 project, people assume that  roadworks have started only when they see plant and people in high-visibility  jackets at the side of the road. However, a significant amount of work has been  carried out on design and on undertaking the statutory processes for both the A5  and A6 routes, as is the case for projects on many other major road networks.  The work is ongoing and is ahead of schedule, and I anticipate that that good  work will bear fruit in that the project will be completed within its agreed  timescale.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: On  two occasions, points have been raised about the requirements of ministerial  statements and whether another Minister should be present. The role of the  Speaker is to ensure that ministerial statements conform to the requirements of  Standing Order 18A.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is not the job of the Speaker to examine and agree the  terminology of ministerial statements. That is an issue for the Executive and  individual Ministers. It is important that I say that. The Speaker has a role  to play, and I am content that Mr Murphy&rsquo;s statement meets the requirements.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as a  r&aacute;iteas. I thank the Minister for his statement. He is initiating a freight  forum. Will the terms of reference for that forum be shared with the Assembly  and the Committee for Regional Development?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The terms of reference will be shared with the  Committee for Regional Development, as will all such matters. It is intended  that the forum will explore areas such as economic competitiveness and  environmental sustainability issues that relate to freight transport, including  the realistic potential for rail freight; the rationale for priority freight  routes catering for vehicles with greater loads; the scope for the promotion  and development of key logistic centres in the interests of sustainable urban  mobility; the opportunities for optimising existing network capacity with  desirable competitiveness and sustainability outcomes through the rescheduling  of deliveries in urban areas; the incentives needed for greater uptake of  fuel-efficient vehicles; and the potential of intelligent transport systems and  services to improve efficiency and, ultimately, competitiveness. It is intended  that representation on the forum will be drawn from industrial development  agencies, industry representative bodies and the Departments. All that is at an  exploratory stage, but I will be happy to update the Committee and the Assembly  as the work progresses.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  The Minister assures the House that &pound;400 million from the Irish Government is  still in place for the A5 project. What about the contribution from the other  Government &mdash; our Government? Is it in place? When does the Minister expect the  A5 project to commence?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The A5 project has started. As I said already, most  people assume that road building has not commenced until workers are visible on  site. A huge amount of work has been undertaken on the development of the A5  project. The first milestone was completed ahead of schedule, and we will be  able to announce the preferred route in July, which is also ahead of schedule.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We have a strong commitment to this important project. The  Irish Government&rsquo;s financial commitment adds to the importance of the project,  and it places an imperative on the Executive to ensure that they uphold their  side of the bargain, as well as the imperative that is on them to ensure that  the work continues.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am satisfied with developments to date. Work is ongoing,  and the preferred route corridor will be announced. After that, we will get  into the statutory processes, which will take some time, and further design  work will be done on the route.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Given that the Member represents a rural constituency, he  will know that the A5 scheme will run through some 80 km of countryside. That  means that there will be many instances in which landowners and properties will  be affected. In such cases, people are entitled to proper compensation, and  issues such as access to and from farms must be sorted out. There is much work  to be undertaken, but I am satisfied with the progress to date and that we will  continue to make good progress on the scheme.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I am grateful to the Minister for his statement. He will know that I am not an  enthusiastic supporter of the Narrow Water bridge project. His statement  referred to the role and attitude of Louth County Council. Will the Minister  inform the House of the role and attitude of the Irish Government and the National  Roads Authority and their level of commitment to the proposed scheme? Given the  current economic climate, particularly in the Irish Republic,  is the proposed scheme viable? Will the Minister also clarify his Department&rsquo;s  involvement, if any, in the Narrow Water bridge project?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the study that is being undertaken into the more  sensible proposal of providing a relief road linking the A2 Warrenpoint Road and the A1 at Newry.  Does the Minister agree that that is more likely to make a substantial contribution  to easing the problems of Newry, particularly the freight problems that drivers  experience leaving Warrenpoint harbour and also by Warrenpoint Harbour  Authority?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: For someone who considers the Narrow Water bridge  project to be pie in the sky and not viable, the Member spends an awful lot of  time talking about it. The position on both schemes remains the same. The Irish  Government funded Louth County Council to appoint consultants to carry out a  study on the bridge project, and that study is ongoing. Some public presentations  have been made, and further work is under way. I am not aware of what the Irish  Government will do beyond that point. They will take a decision when the work  that Louth County Council has been tasked to carry out is completed, and I will  await that decision.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Narrow Water bridge project is not designed to address  the issue of freight, transport or connectivity between Warrenpoint port and  the Belfast to Dublin road. The southern relief road scheme,  however, is designed to address those issues and will have a greater impact on  improving traffic congestion and freight transport from the port. Therefore, it  is unfair to compare the two schemes in that respect. Nonetheless, I have  received a preliminary report on the southern relief road scheme. More work on  it is being considered, and I hope to be able to launch that work at some stage  in the future.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  The Minister gave a positive report on the various schemes under his control.  What are the budgetary pressures for this financial year and the next? What  impact are those pressures having on those schemes, and are they leading to  delay in the published timetable for the schemes?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Following Lord Morrow&rsquo;s line of questioning, can the  Minister comment on the implications of the Chancellor&rsquo;s UK Budget statement,  which makes clear that significant budgetary cuts will take place from 2011  onwards? Can he confirm that those cuts will inevitably lead to those schemes  being significantly delayed?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The Member tends to favour the school of thought that  the glass is half empty rather than half full. The Budget that has been agreed  for the three-year period is the Budget under which we must operate &mdash; we have  not been told any different. If financial pressures are being experienced, the  Executive will do what they continually do: reassess constantly the Budget and  try to prioritise the schemes as best as we can. To hear the Member&rsquo;s party,  one would think that that was not the case.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In the investment strategy, we set out the schemes that we  would like to take forward and the time frame for them. As far as design and  the statutory process are concerned, we have started to make significant  progress on practically all the schemes, and many schemes are ahead of  schedule. Therefore, a significant investment has already been made in all  those schemes &mdash; perhaps not on the ground but in undertaking preparatory work &mdash;  and we intend to press ahead with them. If the Budget scenario in 2011 is  different, we will do what any good Executive would do and reassess our  position at that stage.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  also welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement, although I must make a procedural point.  Some of us understand that Ministers come to the House to make statements on  behalf of the Executive, and it is less than satisfactory when matters  discussed at an NSMC meeting are not subject to proper discussion.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">However, on matters for which Mr Murphy does accept  responsibility, I note that he talked about a sustainable transport strategy.  Given the Minister&rsquo;s recent success in announcing investment in new rolling  stock for local services for Northern Ireland Railways, does he not accept that  if we are to maintain the gains made over the past decade through the increased  usage of the Belfast to Dublin Enterprise rail service, there is now a  significant need for further investment in track and rolling stock as an urgent  priority?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: There is an acceptance that there is a significant  need for investment in the Enterprise  service, but that comes up against the hard reality of the resources available  to us. Therefore, the intention is to improve the service, and the objective  remains the same. We asked the two companies, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and NIR, to carry  out a piece of work to show how they would improve the service, including its  frequency, comfort, reliability and speed. That involved not just work on the  stock but on the track. It is intended to press ahead with that when the  resources become available. In the interim, we will have to try to do what work  we can to improve the reliability of the train sets.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is still the intention, the desire and the objective to  improve the service, as it is the key service on the island for connectivity  between the two cities, and we want to ensure that it stays that way. The  Member is right: the growth in the number of rail passengers is probably due to  improvements in the comfort and reliability of the service, and investing in  the service is the way in which we will continue to grow passenger numbers.  There has been significant investment in new trains, and we would like to make  the same investment in the Enterprise  service. However, we may have to wait a little longer to get the resources for  that. It is not simply a matter of capital investment; revenue investment is  also required if the frequency of the service is to be increased.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. F&aacute;ilt&iacute;m roimh an r&aacute;iteas seo &oacute;n  Aire. Ba mhaith liom tagairt a dh&eacute;anamh do a d&oacute; n&oacute; a tr&iacute; de na tionscnaimh a  luaitear i gcomhth&eacute;acs an droichid ag an Chaoluisce agus an droichid ag Baile  na Caradh agus an b&oacute;thar faoisimh taobh &oacute; dheas de I&uacute;r Cinn Tr&aacute;. I welcome the  Minister&rsquo;s statement. I will refer to some of the projects mentioned by the  Minister, particularly the Narrow Water bridge and the Ballynacarry bridge. A  further appraisal is to be undertaken of the Narrow Water bridge, and there is  still an ongoing appraisal of the Ballynacarry bridge. Does the Minister agree  that, at the end of the appraisals, we would like to see some action taking  place and some work beginning on the ground on both those schemes? What is the  Minister&rsquo;s initial assessment of the findings of the feasibility study for a  Newry southern relief road? Go raibh maith agat.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The responsibility for assessing, designing and  taking forward the Ballynacarry scheme lies with Monaghan County Council, and  the responsibility for the Narrow Water scheme lies with Louth County Council.  I omitted that fact in my reply to Danny Kennedy. The lead agency is on the  southern side of the border and, if Members are asking for updates on those  works, they should be referred to the people who are dealing with them. That  was misinterpreted for genuine or mischievous reasons &mdash; I am not quite sure  which. However, it was misinterpreted anyway. The two county councils are the  lead agencies for both projects, and they are carrying out those assessments.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Monaghan County Council, in conjunction with the National  Roads Authority, will decide what priority the Ballynacarry bridge project will  have. We have been very supportive of that project. The Member will know from  his constituency interests that the people in that part of south Armagh and Monaghan would like to see that project  addressed quickly. The east border region has supported the project, and we  have ensured that the authorities in the South are aware of that and that they  support the INTERREG money available for that area being spent on that project.  We are giving it every encouragement.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The position on the Narrow Water bridge is as it was. Roads  Service and Louth County Council have been conducting their studies and sharing  information. When Roads Service has been asked for any information or support,  it has provided it and will continue to do so gladly. I am encouraged by my  preliminary assessment of the southern relief road study.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  Just over a year ago, the North/South group CAWT produced a detailed report on  road safety that involved a wide range of interests. When the report was  published, it was expected that it would be taken up at North/South level. As  my colleagues said, it is a matter of regret that, although road safety was  discussed at the meeting, we do not have a report about it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I expressed my disappointment at the omission of a  discussion on the Belfast to Sligo  road at earlier meetings, and I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s commitment that the  matter will be raised. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s detailing of what is happening  on the northern side. Did he gain any information from authorities on the southern  side of the border about steps that they have taken or are soon to take to take  the joint venture forward?</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">12.45 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The Member will know that work is ongoing in the  Manorhamilton area on the southern side of the border; that was discussed at  the time that the report was launched by both councils. The Southern Government  did not give me any more update on or commitment to further roadworks to be  undertaken between the border and Sligo.  However, I assume that both councils and those who support the Sligo to Belfast project will  continue to press the case for that work.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In the early stages, we outlined some of the work that we  have planned, such as the Dungannon to Ballygawley project and the bypasses of  Fivemiletown and Enniskillen. I know that roadworks are planned for the Manorhamilton  area on the Southern side, but I was not given further information on any other  planned works.</p>
      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="3"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
      <p class="H4StageHeading">Planning</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have received notice from the Minister of the Environment that he wishes to  make a statement regarding the weight to be given to the economic benefits of  development proposals.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment (Mr S Wilson)</strong>: With your permission, Mr Speaker, I wish to  make a statement to underline the importance that I attach to ensuring that the  planning system contributes to the growth of our economy, especially at this  difficult time.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive&rsquo;s Programme for Government makes economic  growth and wealth creation our top priority, to be taken forward in a fair and  sustainable manner. That strategic priority is echoed as a key theme that  underlies our planning system, which seeks to deliver economic development  while protecting and enhancing the environment. As Members will know, over the  last few years there has been widespread pressure for the planning system to be  reformed. We all recognise that the system needs to adapt more flexibly and  more quickly to the many challenges that we face, particularly in the current  economic climate.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">My Department has already achieved a range of process  improvements. We have created two strategic project teams at planning  headquarters who will handle all large-scale investment proposals. To enhance  their effectiveness, those teams include specialists from Roads Service and the  NIEA, two of our key consultees. That is contributing to faster and better  decisions. Many economically significant planning applications will be dealt  with by the strategic project teams; it is high-profile and important work.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is vital that proposals that may bring investment be  processed as quickly as possible. The achievement of that will require the  commitment of everyone who is involved in the planning process. We need better  planning applications that contain all the necessary information to allow a  decision to be made. The strategic project teams also work alongside the  Strategic Investment Board to ensure that capital-spend projects flow smoothly  through the planning process. That partnership has been particularly effective  in delivering new schools in the Belfast  area, for example.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, I am pleased to say that the strategic project  teams processed 25 article 31 applications in 2008-09. Those included a number  of high-priority cases such as the &pound;29 million investment in the Public Record  Office; the new acute hospital at Enniskillen, which will cost &pound;250 million;  and signature tourism projects at the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway  and the Titanic Quarter, which have a value of &pound;110 million. Those projects  were all processed in line with the six-month target that is set in the  Programme for Government, and they will give a boost to our economy&rsquo;s  construction sector over the next few years.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">More locally, my officials give priority to applications on  which grant aid may depend and to those with an employment, community or  public-interest dimension.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, working with the city council in Londonderry, we piloted a streamlined consultation scheme  for non-contentious planning applications. I am pleased to say that we had  rolled out this scheme to all councils before the end of March, and approval  decisions now take, on average, 24 days to issue. That means that extensions  and alterations are approved more quickly, as well as other planning issues  such as agricultural buildings, advertisements and shop fronts. That will make  life much easier for those who wish to get on with development and grow their  businesses, particularly in small and medium-sized enterprises. That more  proportionate approach benefits councils and the Planning Service. Decisions  are made faster, the economic and social benefits are realised more quickly,  and council and departmental officials are able to focus on more important  applications, particularly those with significant economic and social  implications.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I also want to encourage developers to engage with local  communities before an application is submitted. That applies to people who  should discuss proposed house extensions with neighbours and to developers who  should engage with the local community and interest groups. Too often, it is  only after an application has been submitted that people hear what is being  proposed, and they often object to issues that could have been resolved, had  the proposal been discussed beforehand. As with the other process improvements  that I have highlighted, I expect that such front-loading will ensure that  applications have a smooth passage.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In addition to the process improvements, there are some  planning policy statements in the pipeline that will facilitate economic  development both in settlements and in the open countryside. I look forward to  publishing the revised and updated PPS 4, which concerns economic development  and has been awaiting Executive clearance since January 2009. PPS 21, which I  published in November 2008, also contains policies for economic development in  the open countryside, including farm diversification. The Executive are  committed to the development of our tourist industry, and it is vital that we  have the right planning policies in place to underpin appropriate  tourism-related development projects. That is why I will soon bring forward  draft PPS 16, which will set out the policy for tourist facilities and  accommodation. Subject to Executive clearance, PPS 18, on renewable energy,  will be published before the recess.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The planning system cannot be expected to satisfy all  interests all the time. Economic growth, including major infrastructure  provision, requires development. However, that development must be sustainable  and take into account all the relevant material considerations in the wider  public interest. My Department&rsquo;s guiding principle to development management is  set out in paragraph 59 of Planning Policy Statement 1: General Principles:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;in determining planning applications &hellip; development  should be permitted, having regard to the development plan and all other  material considerations, unless the proposed development will cause  demonstrable harm to interests of acknowledged importance.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Competing interests often emerge in the assessment  of development proposals. That requires the planning system to balance  important social, economic and environmental considerations. The weight given  to those is a judgement that lies with the decision-maker and will vary with  each planning application.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That brings me to the main point of the statement. I want  to give decision-makers the confidence and support to make judgements that will  give greater weight to economic considerations where it is appropriate to do  so. I want to give clarity and to leave no one in any doubt about how to deal  with economic considerations. That is not a change of policy. The purpose of  this statement is to provide certainty and to give guidance so that the  planning system can play a positive role in encouraging investment and  kick-starting regeneration. To that end, the following paragraph clarifies the  weight that should be accorded to economic aspects in the making of planning  decisions.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Full account shall be taken of economic aspects of a  planning proposal, including the wider benefits to the regional or local  economy, alongside social and environmental aspects, in so far as they are  material considerations in the determination of the planning application to  which they relate. In cases where the economic benefits of a proposal are  significant, substantial weight shall be afforded to them in the determination  of that planning application. However, in order that my officials can do that  and determine planning applications without delay, it is essential that they have  all the relevant information about development proposals at their disposal. It  is, therefore, up to everyone involved in the planning process, including  developers, agents and public representatives, to ensure that all information  about economic benefits is provided at the outset.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In these difficult economic times, I want to ensure that  our planning system plays a full and positive role in assisting economic  recovery so that we can benefit from better times when they come.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for the Environment (Mr McGlone)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a  Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his statement. He said that the  proposals were not a change of policy. I understand the general thrust of what  the Minister appears to be saying. However, for those Members who sit through  Committee meetings on the interpretation of policy &mdash; many of whom are present  today &mdash; will the Minister provide a bit of clarity on his statement&rsquo;s  anticipated impact on the interpretation of policy if, in fact, it is not a  change of that policy?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister comment on the concerns that members  expressed at a Committee meeting on 30 April 2009 about the 20% increase in  planning fees that he proposed and that his permanent secretary relayed to us?  Go raibh maith agat.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: First, the current planning policies are peppered with  references to the importance of economic considerations. All Members will know  that, because they have probably been in planning offices with developers or  objectors when dealing with planning applications and making arguments.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">From day to day, planners find themselves torn between the  various strands of policy, some of which are complementary and some of which  are, by their very nature, in competition with one another. Given the passion  that many planning applications can generate among objectors, developers and,  indeed, public representatives, every planning officer has to weigh up the  importance of different parts of policy.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">This is not a change of policy. If it was a change of  policy, it would have required widespread consultation etc. This is simply an  attempt by me, as Minister of the Environment, to translate a priority of the  Executive that I want to see in the planning system down to those officers who  have to take difficult decisions on the ground.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It means that, if planning officers, in weighing up all of  those considerations in the circumstances that I outlined, have to give greater  weight to an economic consideration, they can be confident that they are  reflecting the wishes of the democratically elected Assembly, the Executive and  the Minister. That will be important for planning officers from day to day.  However, it does not mean that they can ignore certain policies. As no planning  decision is based on one particular policy, where that balance is to be made, I  hope that this clarification will give greater confidence and information to  those people who are making the decisions at the coalface.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, I note that the Environment Committee made some  comments on planning fees. The decision to increase planning fees was not taken  lightly. However, it is the first increase for four years, and most of it is  based on the level of inflation that applied over that period. I took the  decision only after considering all the efficiencies that I could make in the  planning system and in the Department to make up the impending shortfall in  available staff and resources. I put a bar on recruitment, cut overtime in the  Department, stopped the upgrading of posts, and so forth. I have taken action  to save money in all those areas. I took money from other parts of the  Department&rsquo;s budget and transferred it into the Planning Service. My colleague  the Minister of Finance and Personnel also provided some money. However, given  the economic downturn, a shortfall remained. To keep the planning system running  effectively and to avoid losing expertise, an increase in planning fees was  considered as a last resort.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">1.00 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I remind the Chairperson of the Committee for the  Environment that most planning fees in Northern Ireland  remain substantially lower than those in the rest of the UK. In Northern Ireland, a cap of &pound;12,500 on planning  fees applies to large developments of more than 50 houses whereas the cap in England is  &pound;125,000, which is a huge difference. The increase in the price for an  application to build an individual house will be approximately &pound;110, which is  also lower than in other parts of the United Kingdom and represents a  small proportion of the total cost of building a house. The increase in  planning fees does not, therefore, disadvantage applicants. The planning system  would have been considerably more damaged by the loss of expertise through  sufficient planning officers not being available to deal with applications.  Developers tell me constantly that speed is the single most important element  of a planning application, and speed can be achieved only by having enough  resources available to process applications.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement. He touched on the answer to my question  in his response to the Chairperson of the Committee for the Environment. Will  he outline the practical economic benefits of the direction that his Department  has taken? Will he also update the House on the position of PPS 4, to which he  referred in his statement?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: As I said in my earlier answer, the practical benefits are  that the planners will have greater clarity and will, therefore, be able to  make decisions with greater assurance. That will be particularly true of cases  that are finely balanced. In future, when planning officers are wondering how  to balance the environmental, social and economic considerations, they will  have the full weight of the Executive and ministerial priority behind them,  which will be helpful.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">PPS 4 is another issue that is being held up at the  Executive as it awaits the approval of the parties. In the past, I have made no  bones about the fact that the process of receiving Executive clearance can be  extremely difficult, even for some hugely important issues. Whether the issue  is planning reform or PPS 14, those who delay the process must consider whether  they are serving the economy of Northern    Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as a  r&aacute;iteas.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am grateful to the Minister for making his statement.  However, Assembly policies must be based on equality, and opportunities must be  provided for people in rural and urban areas.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the new policies that the Minister mentioned.  However, will he assure the Assembly that those who implement the policies will  be properly trained? Different divisions, for example, clearly interpret draft  PPS 21 in different ways.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">No matter what policy is devised and implemented, those  people should be properly trained in the interim period. There should be one  interpretation across the board, because confusion is being caused in the  public domain. That must be looked at. I reiterate that any policy should be  based on equality, and people should be given the opportunity to apply and  develop. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I do not wish to get into a debate on the differences that  I have with Sinn F&eacute;in on the planning reform proposals, which are as important  as today&rsquo;s statement in making the planning system effective for delivering for  the economy. All the assessment that has been done on the equality implications  of the planning reform proposals is exactly in line with the requirements of  the equality legislation. It mirrors exactly what has been done by Sinn F&eacute;in  Ministers on the proposals that they have brought forward to the Assembly. The  equality screening has been done to the same standard as that which has been  carried out by Sinn F&eacute;in Ministers. The conclusions were based on the same  information as was used by Sinn F&eacute;in Ministers when they looked at equality.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The commitment that I have given to ensure that no equality  issues are involved once the proposals go into the public domain is far greater  than what some other Ministers have done. The planning reform proposals, which  are important in this context, have been equality screened to the same degree  as would have been done by any other Minister. This is not an excuse for not  progressing with the planning reform proposals.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I take the Member&rsquo;s point about consistency of application,  and I will be surprised if that point is not raised by a number of other  Members. With any new policy, there will be an issue of ensuring that the  people who have to apply it are fully aware of all the details of how it should  be applied. The good thing is that, even where there have been some  differences, no decision notices have been issued, because the final version of  PPS 21 will not be available until the autumn. Any refusals are still being  held until that final version is available. Once it becomes available, the  applications can be looked at again.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to ensure that the same kinds of standards  and interpretations are applied across offices. A large number of Members have  written to me to point out where they believe that there have been differences  of interpretation. I have asked officials to look at that, because I take the  matter seriously and there is no point in having a policy that is more  draconian in one part of the country than in another. The Planning Service must  address that issue. We have to accept that it takes a bit of time for a new  policy to bed in and that it takes time for people to ensure that they are  applying the policy equally.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  The Minister wants planners to give greater weight to economic considerations  when it is appropriate to do so. He says that developers, agents and  representatives need to lobby to make their case. The Minister remains active  on Belfast City Council&rsquo;s planning committee, and he lobbies on individual  cases. Does the Minister recognise that he is putting planners in an impossible  situation in that they may not be giving what he considers to be appropriate  weight to the views of their Minister?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I have been the Environment Minister for a year, and the  one thing that I would have expected of the Member is that, by now, he would  have found a different question to ask me.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I understand that the Assembly is interested in  environmentally friendly policies, and so on. However, to recycle the same  question practically biweekly is going a bit far. The Member has heard my  answer to that question already, and he knows my attitude to that issue already.  Rather than my simply recycling my answer, I implore the Member to try to get a  different script. If he does not have a researcher who can provide him with a  more incisive question, he ought to employ someone else.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: As  Mr Beggs just pointed out, the Minister highlighted some of the ongoing  difficulties in the current process. Specifically, given the fact that the  Minister says that he looks forward to publishing PPS 4, which is being held up  in the Executive, can he inform the Assembly whether the economy is still the  Executive&rsquo;s number one priority? Is draft PPS 16 held up in his Department or  in the Executive? Can he tell the House what has happened to PPS 18, which is  also being held up somewhere between his Department and the Executive?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister stated that he proposes to give greater weight  to economic considerations. What does that mean? Does it mean that greater  weight than previously will be given to economic considerations? Does it mean  that greater weight will be given to economic considerations than to the social  and environmental considerations that planners are also obliged to take into  account?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Subject to the Executive&rsquo;s approval, I hope that PPS 18  will be published before the summer recess. We are working to publish draft PPS  16 as quickly as possible.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am reluctant to suggest a timetable because those issues  are not always in my hands. As the Member well knows, under the checks and  balances of our system of Government &mdash; which, incidentally, the Alliance Party  was partly instrumental in setting up &mdash; those policies are subject to, and must  have, the approval of a number of parties. I cannot comment on how quickly or  slowly other parties will operate on the matter. All that I can say is that my  desire is to put in place a suite of appropriate policies that offer guidance  and certainty to planning applicants and to those who must make decisions on  those applications.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I said that greater weight will be attached to economic  considerations. I believe that, in the past, I have made my view clear that  when it comes to material considerations, sometimes economic considerations  have not been given as much weight as I would have liked. I must say that when  I look at the correspondence and the number of meetings about planning  applications that other Members seek with me, I get the impression that a large  number of them, through the course of their work, believe that much greater  weight should be given to either the preservation or creation of jobs in their  constituencies.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, it is partly in response to my gut feeling,  partly in response to representations that other Members have made on the  issue, and partly in response to people in the development industry that I want  to clarify the weight that I believe must be given to economic considerations.  Greater weight means simply that: in circumstances where there is a balance of  arguments and where it is appropriate, greater weight must be given to economic  considerations.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I must make it clear to the Member that that does not mean  that a bad planning application will be accepted simply because someone  attaches a paragraph to it that states that it is of economic significance.  Moreover, it does not mean that we can override policies to which we are  already committed.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">1.15 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. In response to an earlier question, the  Minister said that he did not want to debate the reasons why Sinn F&eacute;in is  delaying planning reform. He seemed to avoid that issue. How will further delays  affect planning reform?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The irony is that most of those planning reform proposals  have been well circulated in the public domain. They first came to the Assembly  and to the Committee for the Environment in the form of emerging proposals.  Thereafter, given the lack of opposition to those proposals, I increased their  status to planning reform proposals and circulated them among Ministers. At  that stage, Ministers made no adverse comments. I had hoped to publish the proposals  in January and that the consultation would have been completed by now.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Good sound proposals will be attractive to those who wish  to develop and to those who are affected by development. A range of people,  from environmental groups to developers, welcomed the emerging proposals. One  implication of delay is that people will be disappointed that the Assembly is  not doing the work that it should be doing. However, more importantly, the  reform proposals refer to the devolution of the planning function to councils.  Given that we will establish the new councils in 2011, we are working to a  strict timetable. As I said in the Assembly a couple of weeks ago, I question  whether we will be able to devolve planning powers to those councils within the  agreed timetable. Those councils might begin their work without significant  devolved functions.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  statement.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in believes that the special guidance notes that are  attached to PPS 18 are contrary to the spirit of the policy. Indeed, the  industry estimates that the special guidance notes will result in at least a  75% reduction in investment in onshore and offshore wind farms. How will the  limitations cited in the special guidance impact on investment in the  renewables sector? Has an economic impact assessment been carried out on that  guidance? Furthermore, the Minister should rest assured that Sinn F&eacute;in will  ensure that any planning policies that come to the Executive will be  effectively equality-proofed.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I sometimes feel like a broken record when I discuss that  matter. As it stands, the policy is generous to the wind-farm industry. Under  the current policy, we have issued enough approvals to meet the Executive&rsquo;s  target for generating electricity from wind by 2012. There are 50 applications  in the system, which, if approved, will enable us to meet the targets that have  been set for 2025.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There has been considerable debate about the guidance notes  that are attached to PPS 18. The industry, the Planning Service and I are  battling on that issue at the moment. I want to put my views on the guidance  notes on record.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The wind-farm industry has circulated the story that the  guidance notes will restrict the height of wind turbines and reduce their  effectiveness and efficiency. They want no restriction on those wind turbines.  The guidance notes indicate a height limit. If developers then propose to build  a turbine higher than that limit, they will have to make a case for that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We are speaking about turbines that, very often, will be in  sensitive areas of Northern    Ireland. A balance must be struck when  approving a planning application. There are beautiful tourist areas, and people  go to those areas because they enjoy the landscape and the natural heritage,  but someone may want to build a wind turbine of a size equivalent to the BT  Riverside Tower beside the Waterfront Hall in the middle of that area. All that  the guidelines say is that &mdash; and we are speaking mostly about land-based  turbines &mdash; if an applicant wishes to make a case for a wind turbine that is  higher than 80 m, they must be able to justify it. That will then become a material  consideration, and what I am announcing today will be part of that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">When judging the acceptable height of a wind turbine for  which someone is seeking planning permission, the environmental considerations  should be taken into account, as should the social considerations because they  will, of course, generate more noise, flicker etc for people who live nearby.  The economic considerations should also be taken into account. Someone may well  argue that a bigger turbine is needed to make the proposal economically  effective. That will be a consideration of which the planners will have to take  account.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Rather than opposing the point of view that Mr McKay  expressed, my announcement should actually be helpful. I do not think that  people would be happy if I were to introduce a policy stating that developers  could build turbines of whatever height they wanted, regardless of the context  in which they were to be placed. If developers want to build bigger turbines,  they should make the cases for them. Those cases will be examined by the  planning officers, and decisions will be made.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. There are quite a few planning applications  in my area, and greater consideration of the economic aspects of those would be  very welcome.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The planning system that the Minister and his predecessor  inherited was criticised from all quarters, but he has set out a programme of  many wide-ranging reforms, some of which he has mentioned, including the  streamlined consultation process and the creation of the strategic projects  unit. Another piece of work that has been carried out is the review by the  performance and efficiency delivery unit (PEDU). Will the Minister provide the  House with an update on the outworkings of that review, and how it is impacting  on reforming the planning system even further?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: My Department instigated some work on the planning system  by PEDU, which considered a number of issues, including the internal processing  of planning applications, case management, etc. It also considered how we could  be more proactive in managing cases in the planning system. Nigel Dodds, the  Minister of Finance and Personnel, and I have held joint meetings with the  Planning Service and PEDU. We are happy that many of the suggestions have been  taken on board.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A number of issues arose, including internal case  management and how we could be more proactive about that. There was also the  issue of the service-level agreements with consultees, which, I must say, were  sometimes service-level agreements in name only, because although they included  timescales, those timescales were missed time and time again. We have looked at  how those could be tightened up.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The planning reform proposals now include more definite  proposals, such as statutory limits on the length of time that consultees have,  and ways to ensure that developers make better planning applications.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">PEDU has made a range of recommendations, and we have taken  those on board. Those recommendations are already improving the way in which  planning decisions are made.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement. How will he ensure consistency of  approach to the new policy on the part of planning officials? He will be aware  of Planning Service&rsquo;s significant staffing problems in recent years because of  retirements of senior staff and headhunting by the private sector. It is  important that any new policy, or suggested policy, should be applied  consistently throughout Northern    Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am concerned about the application of the new policy. How  does the Minister intend to curtail the rather aggressive approach of Planning  Service&rsquo;s enforcement section, which seems to be intent on making it almost  impossible for owners of small businesses to operate, particularly in rural  areas? The Minister will be aware of a couple of cases that I have raised with  him directly. The enforcement section has a potential key role to play in  making it possible for owners of small businesses to operate by not being  overly restrictive or insistent on some regulations, which, quite frankly, are  extreme.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I will correct the Member, as I do not want it put on the  record that this is a new policy. It is not a new policy; it is guidance on,  and clarification of, existing policy. We must ensure that there is consistency  of application of policies such as PPS 21. Otherwise, people will ask questions  about the way in which the planning system is working. Training of staff within  the system by way of exchange and movement is important in achieving  consistency, because it will allow staff to see what happens in different areas  and offices.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is a degree of subjectivity and discretion to the  matter in hand; none of us, when asked to weigh up the same set of arguments,  will come to the same decisions, because we will give weight to different  aspects. Given those elements of discretion or subjectivity, it is impossible  to have 100% consistency. All we can do, through building up cases and examples,  is to seek to ensure that that consistency happens.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">On the issue of enforcement, this guidance does not give  people who have been in breach of the policy the opportunity to set aside that  policy. In many enforcement situations, it will be the case that individuals,  either because they could not be bothered or because they thought that they could  get away with it, have not even considered the policy, or they may not even  have applied for planning permission, and then they get caught. There is no  point in my giving the impression that this policy will deal with such cases;  it will not. I know of many examples in which more consideration could have  been given to the jobs that were lost because businesses were closed down in a  particular area. I hope that the guidance will help to preserve such  businesses.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement, in which he made a brief mention of PPS  21. What progress is being made on draft PPS 21?</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">1.30 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The consultation has finished, and those results will go  before the Environment Committee next week. I think that that will happen next  Thursday. The Executive subgroup will also consider the consultation results.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">On 26 June, I will receive the report from the review group  that has been considering what can be done for non-farm rural dwellers. We will  consider changes to draft PPS 21 over the summer, and that should be finalised  in the autumn, when the policy will go to the Executive for final ratification.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We are emphasising the retention of vernacular buildings in  respect of replacement dwellings or dealing with disused buildings. I hope that  the design guide will be available towards the end of the year. That will offer  guidance to people who must restore old buildings on the type of additional  features that can be added.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I spoke at a conference in Cushendall a couple of weeks  ago. We looked at some old vernacular buildings and modern additions that had  been made to them. I would be quite excited if the design guide could  incorporate some of those ideas so that we can make good use of some of the old  buildings in the countryside. Consequently, those buildings would not have to  be knocked down, but could be turned into useful, liveable properties.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  refer the Minister to PPS 18 and the draft supplementary guidance. How does he  respond to the criticisms that have been made about what some people view as  subjective criteria in that draft? How can those subjective criteria give  assurance to people who are seeking to invest in renewables?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister assure the House that PPS 18 will be  pitched in such a manner that will not just meet the minimum targets that have  been set, but will give Northern    Ireland the opportunity to emerge as a world  leader in both onshore and offshore wind-energy production?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I am not sure what subjective guidance the Member is  referring to. It may have been better if his question had been a bit more  specific.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The criticism that I have heard from the wind industry is  not that we are being subjective, but that we are being too prescriptive on  turbine heights, and so on. I hope that I have explained in my earlier answer  why we have set those limits, and what developers have to do if they wish to  make a case for taller turbines.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As for renewable energy and its implementation in Northern Ireland,  we must be careful not to regard wind power as some type of panacea. There are  downsides. We have introduced and will introduce planning policies that seek to  assist those who wish to introduce renewable-energy projects to their own homes  at a micro level. One of the proposals of the planning reforms is to allow some  of those projects as permitted developments, so that there would be no need to  apply for planning permission. That cuts down time and cost.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Permissions that have been granted for large-scale  developments and onshore applications demonstrate that we have been fairly  generous. Members will also have an opportunity to debate the impact of  legislation on offshore wind farms when they consider the Marine and Coastal  Access Bill [HL].</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to be very clear: even if we have a large number of  renewable-energy projects across Northern Ireland, the baseload must  still be provided by energy providers that can assure consistency of supply.  That adds cost, because parallel systems will tend to be run.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That is why we must be very careful that we do not simply  see the construction of wind farms as some kind of panacea. We should not think  that if we stick up wind farms, we will get all our energy for nothing because  the wind will provide it and we will not have to buy oil or coal. It does not  quite work like that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That is one of the reasons why planning policy must reflect  the balance between getting renewable energy where it is feasible and  protecting our natural environment. It should not be forgotten that many wind  farms are built on environmentally sensitive sites, because that is where the  wind blows strongest and it is where they are easiest to locate.</p>
      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="4"></a>PRIVATE MEMBERS&rsquo; BUSINESS</p>
      <p class="H4StageHeading">RUC   Museum</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30 minutes for  the debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes in which to propose  and 10 minutes in which to make a winding-up speech. All other Members who wish  to speak will have five minutes.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">One amendment has been selected and published on the Marshalled  List. The proposer of the amendment will have 10 minutes in which to propose  and five minutes in which to make a winding-up speech.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly supports the suggestions for an RUC Museum  at Brooklyn Headquarters<strong> </strong>near to the Garden of Remembrance; and calls on  the Northern Ireland Office to allocate the necessary funding to enable  building to begin during 2009.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate the opportunity to bring this matter to the  Chamber and to speak to the motion.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In 2001, the then Secretary of State for Northern Ireland,  John Reid, announced funding of more than &pound;1 million for the construction of a  Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) garden of remembrance and museum. With the RUC  now replaced by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), Chris Patten,  author of the Patten Report, recommended that a garden honouring and  remembering the officers who had served in the RUC and the PSNI was a fitting  and just memorial. I agree with that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Announcing the financial package on 14 November 2001, Dr  Reid said:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;I am delighted to be  able to announce the creation of a Garden  of Remembrance for the Royal Ulster  Constabulary. Patten identified a need for continued recognition of the  dedication and sacrifice of the officers of the RUC. I fully support this  prestigious and permanent memorial and I look forward to being able to visit  it.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Dr Reid wag awa:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Tha gerdin o&rsquo; remembrins alang wi&rsquo; tha RUC muzeim  wull bring taegither baith proajects intae a&rsquo; kimpleet &lsquo;RUC experience&rsquo; whor  fowk cumin tae it caun luk bakk oan tha sacrifices o&rsquo; tha RUC as they wauk  throo tha memoriel gerdin as weel as takkin in tha muckle items en displeys  aboot tha RUC an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s histry.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Dr Reid continued:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Garden of  Remembrance along with the RUC Museum will draw together both projects into a  complete &lsquo;RUC experience&rsquo; where visitors can reflect on the sacrifices of the  RUC as they walk through the Memorial Garden and visit the many exhibits and  displays about the RUC and its history in the Museum.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Tha fundatshin wus drawn up tae provide pratical  recognishin o&rsquo; tha acheevmunts an sacrifices o&rsquo; tha Royal Ulster Constabulary,  whiel tha woark o&rsquo; tha fun&rsquo; wus tae bring aboot mare help tae luk efter tha  injured an disabled polis oafichers, en oafichers that hae noo retired, as weel  as ther femelies, an ther wudaws wha haes been affected bi&rsquo; terrorism in Norlin  Airlan.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Royal Ulster Constabulary George Cross Foundation was  created to provide practical recognition of the Royal Ulster Constabulary&rsquo;s  achievements and sacrifices. The work of the Northern Ireland Police Fund was  to bring additional assistance to injured, disabled and retired police officers  and their families, as well as police widows, who have been affected by  terrorism in Northern    Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It was all a beautiful plan, and we have a beautiful  memorial garden, yet we are still waiting for the promised museum to be built  on site, alongside the garden. That has being going on for far too long without  intervention. I was contacted by a constituent who was, understandably, very  anxious for the Northern Ireland Office to fulfil its promise and build the  museum beside the garden, where there is ample space and where it would set off  the memorial garden.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Currently, there is an RUC museum on the Knock Road in Belfast, but the best place for such a museum  is beside the garden of remembrance, which I believe was always the intention.  Surely it is best for the museum and the garden to go hand in hand, to allow  people to see the history of the RUC and, indeed, the PSNI, as it is now, and  to see the history of policing in Ireland as a whole, so that they can learn  about the men and women who gave their lives to protect the people of the  Province. This is an opportunity for the two to be built together.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">However, as with most recommendations in the Patten Report,  only those that suited were implemented straight away, with everything else  left hanging in the balance, waiting for people to get around to it. It is past  time that the Assembly stood up and added its voice to the voices of the  thousands of widows and orphans and of those who have served with pride in the  RUC and the PSNI. The Assembly should ask that the Northern Ireland Office  finally fulfil its word and allow for a museum to be built beside the garden,  so that both can be enhanced.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The existing RUC museum is not well known. For example, a  search on the Internet revealed only the location of the museum; there were no  reviews or links, apart from one on the PSNI website, which brought up only an  error page. It is little wonder that there are no reviews of the museum when no  one can find out anything about it. When five people, one of whom was an ex-RUC  officer, were asked whether they knew of the RUC museum&rsquo;s existence, none of  them was. The reason for that is that the museum has not been promoted as it  should have been.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The museum is not well known throughout the international  community. It could be used as a tourist attraction similar to the Newseum in  the United States,  but it must be well publicised, and people must know about it. Situating the  museum beside the memorial garden has the added attraction of ensuring that it  will honour not only the sacrifice of serving members of the RUC and their  families but the promise that was made in 2001.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In 2005, the then Security Minister, Shaun Woodward MP,  visited the memorial garden and again stated how happy he would be to talk to  the trustees about a new museum. However, the Northern Ireland Office has done  nothing about releasing the funding to further the project, which is why we  tabled the motion. How long must we wait for action? How many Northern Ireland  Office officials will make assurances and promises and not be held accountable  for their words?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We have a noble and proud history of having one of the best  police forces in the world. Police experts from Northern Ireland are invited to  numerous places across the globe for their advice and guidance not only because  of their experience in fighting terrorism but because of forensics expertise  that they have acquired over the years. It is recognised that our police force  is at its peak. However, it is sad that we can barely acknowledge that, when  one considers the recommendations of the Patten Report.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Although Members remember the RUC and the exemplary work  and sacrifice of its members, our children and grandchildren will not. We must  ensure that there is a relevant and interesting facility to which we can take  our children to tell them about the history of our colourful country. In the  same way as there are Jewish memorials to the Holocaust, so, too, should there  be reminders for our children of the price paid by good men and good women for  the peace and safety of our beautiful nation and our beautiful land.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Museums are a part of a cultural heritage that should be  enhanced and encouraged. Children are taken to the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum to get a feel for the way that  things used to be and to understand their traditions and heritage better. A  police museum will inform future generations, allow them to understand the  truth behind much propaganda and allow them to see pictures and images that are  vastly different from those that have often appeared in the media. That is essential  as the Province moves on; in moving forward, we cannot and will not forget our  past and allow others to distort and malign real facts and real history. An RUC  museum could show facts in a way that will be interesting and informative for  those who hail from the Province and those who come from abroad. We have been  fortunate that many people have come from abroad to join the police force in Northern Ireland.  Those people have added their cultural identities to our police force, and  their contribution is acknowledged.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">For those who lived through the Troubles, and those who  receive their information through the media &mdash; and there are people who do &mdash; the  museum is necessary. It is long past time that such a museum be built in the  best place and promoted in the best way. The Northern Ireland Office made a  promise, and we will hold it to that promise: a garden of remembrance and a  museum to honour the RUC, the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) and other policing  organisations. We do not yet have that in its entirety, and we will not stop  until we do so.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">My party colleagues and I ask the Northern Ireland Office  to stop its stalling and honour its word. By co-locating the museum and the  memorial garden, let us honour and be ever conscious of the sacrifice of the  men and women who gave their time and their lives in service to our Queen and  country over many years.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">1.45 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I beg to move the following amendment: Leave out all after &ldquo;Assembly&rdquo; and  insert</p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;notes the proposal for an  RUC museum; believes that methods to acknowledge the past, including the role  of the RUC and the different experiences of policing over the years, should be  developed; and recommends that the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure, the  Policing Board, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, the Commission for  Victims and Survivors and the future victims and survivors forum should  consider the matter.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP is not inclined to support the motion. However,  that should not in any way diminish the fact that the broad sentiments that Mr  Shannon outlined are very much arguments and views from which we do not  dissent. His final comment was that the contribution of RUC and police officers  over recent decades and at present should be recognised. As he was saying that,  I was thinking, as, I am sure, were many others, of Constable Stephen Carroll,  who made his contribution to the PSNI, but also to the RUC. Whatever  differences that the SDLP and the nationalist community have had with policing  and the RUC, and whatever concerns we have had about what individuals and  elements in the police were responsible for in the past, there is something to  honour, respect and elevate in what Stephen Carroll and many other officers did  over the years before and since Patten.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In that regard, the SDLP does not dissent from the spirit  and substance of some of what Mr Shannon said. I want to make that very clear.  However, we are still inclined not to support the motion, and we have two broad  streams of thought about the matter. The first is technical and financial and  the second is personal and emotional.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion is very specific. It calls on the NIO to release  funding for an RUC and police museum in this financial year. The SDLP does not  think that that is the best use of public and police funds in this financial  year, because although some of this information has not yet been placed in the  public domain, there are already very substantial and unavoidable pressures on  the police budgets over the next couple of years. If the devolution of policing  and justice were, for example, to happen sooner rather than later, there would  be further and additional pressures on the policing and justice budget over and  above those already identified.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In the context of tight financial pressures and where there  will be unavoidable claims due to the dissident threat, hearing loss and extra  staff for the Public Prosecution Service, where there have been new and  additional concerns in recent days, we do not think that an RUC and police  museum is a priority that justifies money being released in this financial  year. That is different from understanding the sentiment and spirit of what Mr  Shannon said. However, it recognises that, in the current financial  environment, there are grounds for saying that the policing budget and  additional policing moneys should go in directions other than to such a museum.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Given that there are unavoidable and difficult policing and  justice budgetary pressures, I ask Mr Shannon to reflect where this proposal  comes in the order of things. Without diminishing what the Member said, the  SDLP thinks that this is not where the priority budget line should be.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">This is, of course, much more than a technical and financial  issue. It is also personal and emotional, because the experience of people in  the North over the past 30 or 40 years is not about money and technical matters.  Rather, it is very much about personal experience and emotional impact. That is  why we think that acknow&shy;ledging the past and how that is expressed, including  through museums, needs broader and deeper consideration.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That is why we suggested, as the Eames/Bradley group  suggested, that the issue of how a museum might be framed, and there are very  many different models about how a museum to acknowledge the past could be  framed, should be referred to the Commission for Victims and Survivors.  Hopefully, in the near future, it should also be referred to the proposed forum  for victims and survivors.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  I understand the points that the Member raises in relation to the technical  objections, and I am sure that those will be fleshed out during the debate.  However, I fail to understand his emotional objection. I thought that his party  had overcome that objection, especially considering that its representative on  the Policing Board put her name to a letter of 11 March 2008 in which board  members unanimously supported the business case &mdash; not the emotional case,  technical case or outline view &mdash; that allowed for the appointment of a  consultant to take the matter forward with a fully fleshed-out proposal to the  Northern Ireland Office. Is the Member now saying that his party&rsquo;s board  members did not give proper consideration to the issue and that perhaps they  did not look at the broader issue? Have they made a slip-up in this case? Is he  withdrawing consent for the business case during this debate? Is he aware that  that letter was sent?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I anticipated that someone &mdash; most likely Mr Paisley &mdash; would raise this matter.  As I pointed out, we are in a very different place today when it comes to  financial priorities than we have been at any time in the recent past. The SDLP  has been trying to convince the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in that we need to look at  budgets, because our situation is graphically different from what it was 18  months, or even six months, ago. Commitments entered into previously must be  reconsidered in the context of the new budgetary position. That includes that  particular commitment. I thank Mr Paisley for the intervention, but I did  anticipate it, and I think that I have given a fair answer.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">However, the emotional point is a broader one. In some  ways, the Eames/Bradley report was appalling. In chapter five, which deals with  memorials and remembering, it states:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Through  storytelling, people realise that, although they feel their cause was just, not  all that they did in pursuit of it was either the right thing to do, or  altogether necessary.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">In my view, that is an appalling statement for  anyone to make. Things that were wrong were not, as they put it, &ldquo;the right  thing to do&rdquo;; and they describe things that were completely unnecessary as  being not &ldquo;altogether necessary&rdquo;. We must consider proposals about the past and  the museum in the context of the Eames/Bradley report and its weaknesses.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In the same chapter, the group makes some valid points  about how we should acknowledge our past. It states that we must not glamorise  what was wrong, elevate terror or misrepresent the experience of the past. The  report also states that there may be a need for:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;a dedicated &lsquo;Troubles&rsquo; exhibition in an existing  museum.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is why we included the reference to the  Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure (DCAL) in our amendment. I note that  the Minister is present, and that he might reply to the matter in his personal  capacity.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The report states:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;A memorial should direct people to the future and in  particular a shared and reconciled future.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">It also states that we must develop shared space in  order to mitigate any alienation from a shared memorial.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Those are some principles that need to be acknow&shy;ledged  when taking forward the matter of whether there should be a museum to take into  account the particular experience of the RUC, or one that will take into  account the vastly shared experiences, not just of policing, but of society  over the past 30 or 40 years. That debate needs to happen.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">One thing that we can learn from the Patten experience,  regardless of whatever misgivings there might be about some of its details, is  that, at a point in time in our history, a number of people outlined not just a  reflection on the policing of the past but a vision and values for policing in  the future. We are in a far better place today than we would have been had that  not happened. We think that the same thing should happen in respect of our  experience of the past. We need to look at a model that outlines the shared  experience of the past in order to move forward on an ethical basis.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. There can be no doubt that many issues remain to be  resolved by our society as it moves out of and away from conflict and towards  stability. The resolution of those issues will present many challenges for us  all to deal with. We must face them in an open, transparent and equitable way.  There should be no tolerance of playing politics with people&rsquo;s genuine feelings  and grievances.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">One of those challenges will be how we deal with the legacy  of history and how we preserve history, particularly the history of  participants in the conflict. I am a trustee of the Museum of Free Derry.  A main principle of that museum &mdash; its narrative &mdash; is that people who lived  through and witnessed a particular period in our history are entitled to tell  their story. The museum promotes the principle that people have the right to  describe their story and experience in their own words. However, it is accepted  that that cannot be done in isolation from others who do likewise.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The issue of an RUC museum poses many challenges to us.  However, the Assembly recently dealt with the victims&rsquo; issue, which was not  without difficulties and differing views and perspectives. The Executive found  a way forward: a platform in which all those perspectives could be addressed  and resolutions sought. That is not to ignore concerns that were raised in the  establishment of the Victims&rsquo; Commissioners, but people must accept that, no  matter what is proposed, there will always be concerns and issues. That is the  reality of our situation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in supports and is committed to the concept of the  need to preserve the history of the conflict in an appropriate and necessary  way. The party has a view on how that can best be achieved, and it is mindful  of the need for sensitivity about what is a very complex, and, for many, a very  emotional issue. We attempted to introduce an amendment to deal with that, and  we called for time and space to allow all ideas and views to be heard and  addressed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In our view, the legacy of preserving history, an issue  similar to that of victims, should be delegated to the Office of the First  Minister and deputy First Minister (OFMDFM). I have no desire to question the  timing of the motion, but I believe that this is not the time for the Assembly  to take a position as fixed and determinate as that outlined in the motion.  Similarly, the amendment is overly prescriptive. We believe that the Office of  the First Minister and deputy First Minister is best placed to take forward the  task. We have seen how it dealt with the issue of the Victims&rsquo; Commissioners.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Let the debate  begin the discussion on how we best preserve the history of the conflict in an  open, transparent and equitable manner. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McFarland</strong>:  I support the motion. The issue of an RUC museum has festered for more than  seven years; a time that is littered with broken promises and delays. It goes  back to November 2001, when John Reid, the then Secretary of State, promised  the RUC George Cross Foundation a garden and a museum. Since then, the NIO has  prevaricated and nothing has happened.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Members should pay tribute to Jim McDonald and the  foundation for being tenacious in keeping at this issue. Alex Attwood talked  earlier in the debate about money. Jim McDonald said on the radio this morning  that the foundation was more than happy to raise a substantial part of the  funds for the museum, but not until the Government fulfil their commitment to  produce some of the money. The foundation&rsquo;s supporters are happy enough to do  their fair share, but progress must start now.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">What is the importance of such a museum? It is worth  reminding ourselves that it would not be just an RUC museum; it would be about  policing on the island   of Ireland. The museum  would reflect the Royal Irish Constabulary and policing in the 100 years from  1822 to 1922; the Dublin Metropolitan Police from 1836 to 1925; the RUC from  1922 to 2001; the Garda from 1922 to the present; and the PSNI. Therefore, the  museum covers a fairly substantial area of policing on the island of Ireland.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The museum would be a good vehicle for cross-community and  cross-border relations. I have the privilege of being a trustee of the Somme  Heritage Centre, which looks at Ireland&rsquo;s  contribution to the First World War, when the island was one and both sides of  the community were involved. Looking at policing since 1822 is another  opportunity &mdash; right across our community and in relation to North/South matters  &mdash; to consider the whole issue of policing and to provide some degree of common  cause.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am concerned about the SDLP amendment. It would bog the  issue down in faction fighting that would involve DCAL, the Policing Board,  which, although initially happy, may now be unhappy, and victims&rsquo; groups. It is  probably a recipe for disaster.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The issue should be dealt with by the Northern Ireland  Office before the devolution of policing and justice takes place, as was  promised. Otherwise, it will get mixed up with ongoing political conflict.  Surely the men and women who gallantly served the community on the island of Ireland for over 200 years deserve  better. I call on the NIO to fund the museum, and I urge colleagues to support  the motion.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  too support the motion. I recognise that it is far from perfect, but it gives a  strong signal of the way forward for this Assembly. I encourage the Northern  Ireland Office to move ahead with the proposal. I am sympathetic to much of the  thrust of the amendment, but I have two difficulties with it. First, there is a  lack of a specific commitment to an RUC museum. Secondly, it does not place any  pressure upon the Northern Ireland Office to address this issue ahead of the  devolution of policing and justice. Alan McFarland made that important point,  and I will perhaps elaborate on that in a moment.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">My party certainly wants to see a much more collective  approach to commemoration, remembrance and reflection across our society. Although  the Eames/Bradley group&rsquo;s report is far from perfect, it should certainly inform  discussion in that regard. Whether it is under the Eames/Bradley group, the  Commission for Victims and Survivors for Northern Ireland or a forum, a move  should be made towards addressing those important points. That does not need to  exclude studying discrete aspects of the history of Northern Ireland in relation to the  Troubles and beyond. I see scope for things to move ahead on an individual  basis, even though we have an overall framework. We are currently dealing with  a number of inquiries into things that happened in the past. That is  notwithstanding efforts to move to a much more collective way of examining the  past in Northern Ireland  on a more cost-effective basis. There does not have to be a one-size-fits-all  approach to all of those matters.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The point has been made that any museum is not simply based  around what happened in relation to the RUC and the Troubles and it reflects a  much wider history of policing, not just in Northern Ireland but on the island  as a whole, before the Troubles broke out. It is also worth recognising that a  particularly important contribution was made by the RUC. I appreciate that what  I am going to say is not a view held by everyone in this House, but it is  important to recognise that the RUC was the final line against anarchy breaking  out in Northern Ireland  during the years of the Troubles. The semblance of the rule of law and  democracy that we had during that time would not have been possible without the  contribution of the RUC.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Of course, policing in this part of the world is an  extremely contentious and difficult issue. In many respects, policing and the  matter of who controls the police has been at the heart of the Troubles and the  conflict that has occurred here over the past number of years. I am certainly  not saying that the history of the RUC is unblemished. There were acts, both  institutional and individual, that were wrong. When a more detailed scrutiny is  carried out into the past, regardless of whether that happens under a legacy  commission, Eames/Bradley or some other body, no doubt the state will have to  face up to some difficult truths. Equally, other organisations and individuals  will have to face up to difficult truths, and it is important that they are  prepared to co-operate by coming forward in the same way as the state will be  under pressure to do. However, such considerations need not detract from the  contributions that were made by many individual officers, who did nothing but  serve on behalf of their community and who provided that service honourably. Indeed,  during the Troubles, a category of people in our society were targets for no  other reason than the nature of their job. Indeed, the men and women of the RUC  were very much in that category.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In order that we can have a clean start after the devolution  of policing and justice, it is important that we address legacy matters now. I  add this subject to that list. The Northern Ireland Office should follow  through on its commitments. It is unreasonable to burden the incoming  devolution settlement with them. I am enough of a neo-Keynesian to say that  spending the money in the forthcoming financial year makes economic sense. We  are talking about getting people to work and bringing forward capital spend,  which implementing this proposal would achieve.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  If stones could speak, they would tell thousands of stories as we walk around  the memorial garden that honours the standing of, as Alan McFarland said,  policing on this island and, particularly, the Royal Ulster Constabulary. That  memorial garden is at Knock, in Belfast, and it  contains tablets of stone on which is carved a roll of honour that speaks of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  incredible history. Indeed, that history is echoed around this Chamber. Looking  around, I am reminded of a Constable Morrow and two constables named Donaldson,  as well as the incredible memory of a District Inspector Durkan.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The fact should not be lost on the House that the memorial  garden is not for one side or the other. It is not a memorial to or a history  of one side or the other; it is about recounting facts about and the history of  Northern Ireland.  To turn our minds from that fact or to take our hands away from delivering on  that history by not putting a memorial in place tells, in itself, a story about  our society&rsquo;s ineptitude and failure to come to terms with its past.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The technical arguments that have been advanced in order to  dilly and delay are unacceptable. Those arguments are about spending &pound;5  million. However, if we delay implementing the proposal and the matter comes before  the Assembly after policing and justice has been devolved, believe you me, the  financial resources will not be available. Now is the time to extract from the  Northern Ireland Office a portion of the &pound;5 million that is required to  complete the project, so that it might deliver what it was supposed to deliver  almost 10 years ago.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">One Member argued that time and space must be created, but  that would defeat us. By delaying we falter, and, if we falter in delivering  this project, we would fail not just ourselves and the House but the people who  are entitled to have an important, proper and telling history of the events  that, for such a long time, affected every man, woman and child in this  Province.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP has been attempting to spook nationalist horses. Every  aspect of this matter has been settled. Sinn F&eacute;in, the SDLP, the Ulster  Unionist Party and the DUP &mdash; all the political parties that are represented on  the Policing Board &mdash; endorsed a properly fleshed-out business case. It was  wrong for Alex Attwood to attempt to pull the rug from under the feet of his  colleague Dolores Kelly, for that is what happened in the Chamber today. It is  wrong, because, as I said in an intervention, the Policing Board gave its  consent on 11 March last year to the building of an RUC museum. Its support was  not partial or given after some consideration but was unanimous. As a  consequence, the Policing Board commissioned work to be carried out. That  resulted in the Chief Constable backing that work and in the ball being put  firmly in the court of the Northern Ireland Office to deliver on it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">What happened earlier was completely objectionable and indicates  that the SDLP is trying to spook nationalist horses. Today, they are indulging  in a huge amount of theatre, and they are doing so for one reason: the European  election that will be held in a few weeks&rsquo; time. That is incredibly sad, and it  reflects the minds of pygmies rather than the minds of people who are prepared  to be political giants on an issue on which strident and positive steps forward  should be made.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The RUC museum project should go ahead. We are entitled to  it, and by &ldquo;we&rdquo; I mean all the people of Northern Ireland. They are entitled  to see their history recorded appropriately and in a way that honours some of Ulster&rsquo;s most  gallant and fallen people.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. D&uacute;irt mo chara Raymond McCartney  go bhfuil Sinn F&eacute;in ag iarraidh &aacute;r stair a choinne&aacute;il, ach n&iacute; bheimid ag  tabhairt taca&iacute;ochta don r&uacute;n seo n&aacute; don leas&uacute;. My colleague Raymond McCartney  has set out Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s position on the RUC museum. We believe that it is  important that our history be preserved and told in its entirety. We know that  there are many aspects of our history on which many of us disagree. As my  colleague Jim Shannon said, there are facts and there is history. However,  there are some disputed versions of our history and of what we have been told  are historical and, I might add, contemporary facts.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in is conscious that the proposed RUC museum  presents its own challenges; every Member will acknowledge and accept that.  There is a challenge as to how we define our society&rsquo;s history of policing  going back many decades. We are in a much better place now, and that must be  acknowledged. Political giants in our society and community have enabled all of  us to be in the better place in which we are today.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in believes that the matter would be better placed  within the remit of OFMDFM, because the appointment of the Victims&rsquo; Commission  is an example of how OFMDFM can rise to the challenge if the will exists and  political accommodation is sought among the various parties and other  participants. The matter should be in the hands of OFMDFM. It delivered in the  case of the Victims&rsquo; Commission, where, at least, it laid the groundwork for  its establishment. In the time ahead, we want to see a similar approach taken  to ensure that the matter is dealt with maturely and professionally. The  approach must be sensitive to all the views that are held, not least those of  the police family. I wish to acknowledge that. However, wider views must be  taken on board. Policing here has been a long-standing issue of some import,  and, as I said, we have moved to a better place in that regard. We still have some  distance to travel, but we have laid important and positive foundations, and we  are making substantial progress.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">My party and I look forward to a time when we can properly  reflect the history of policing in a way that allows everyone to identify with  and recognise the history as it is spelt out according to their views and their  version of history. Let me be frank: many of the views across our community are  deeply held, and justifiably held.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It may be a bit premature to suggest locating the museum at  Brooklyn headquarters because, as some Members will know &mdash; Policing Board  members will certainly know &mdash; a very important discussion on the police estate  has yet to take place, and the headquarters site may not be left unscathed. We  do not know how much of the current estate will remain in the hands of the  PSNI. Policing Board members have acknowledged that that matter must be dealt  with to ensure that the PSNI can more inclusively take forward full service  delivery in a professional and financially efficient manner. In delivering that  service, we must not only focus on today but look ahead to tomorrow.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in is not arguing that this matter should not be  progressed for financial reasons; we are simply saying that the issue is far  too important to be dealt with in the manner outlined in the motion and the  amendment. As my colleague Raymond McCartney said, we will support neither the  motion nor the amendment, because we believe that it would be much better to  place the matter within the remit of OFMDFM so that it can be dealt with in a  more inclusive way. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  I am firmly of the opinion that the motion seeks to ensure that due respect is  paid to the Royal Ulster Constabulary George Cross and the role that its  members played in the darkest days of the Troubles. None of us should  underestimate that role, and we should all be grateful to the men and women of  the RUC for the job that they did in the most difficult of circumstances. Few  other police forces in Europe and, perhaps,  worldwide did &mdash; or do &mdash; a comparable job. Moreover, few other forces lost so  many of their officers &mdash; from both sides of the community, men and women,  full-time and part-time &mdash; as they carried out their duties or when off duty.  The fact that those officers continued to patrol every community, despite the  difficulties, is the reason why there should be a permanent museum to the RUC  and its valiant officers.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">From the 1960s to the needless name change of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  police force, the police&rsquo;s job changed beyond all recognition. The history of  how policing in Northern Ireland  adapted, developed and responded to changing circumstances must be given a  proper place in Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s history. The best way to do that  is to ensure that a museum is established that charts the course of the RUC and  the changes that were forced upon it by events.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The ideal location for such a museum is near the garden of  remembrance because the officers who are commemorated there paid the ultimate  price for performing their duty in extreme circumstances. The memory of those  officers and the history of the RUC are so deeply entwined as to be virtually  inseparable. The Northern Ireland Office must ensure that funding for the  project is made available as a matter of urgency so that the museum can be  opened at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The amendment seeks to muddy the waters of the debate and  to complicate and extend the process of establishing a museum. It is a great  pity that the Members who tabled the amendment cannot give the motion their  full and wholehearted support. I urge them and every Member to support the  motion as proposed by my colleagues.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I support the motion, but our party will not support the SDLP amendment. The  creation of a policing or RUC museum would be an important manifestation of the  cultural identity of the majority of people in Northern Ireland, quite apart from  its historical significance. The RUC was important not only to the majority  community but to all law-abiding citizens in all communities, and it is well  worth reminding people of that. It is also, therefore, an important part of our  history.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">On a wall in my office in this Building is a copy of a  memorial picture entitled &lsquo;Our Murdered Colleagues&rsquo;, which honours all the RUC  officers who lost their lives during the recent conflict. In my work in the  Assembly, it serves as a daily reminder of the huge sacrifices made by the men  and women of the RUC. It is unfortunate that the PSNI has made a huge sacrifice  recently. We must never return to the days of widespread and wholescale loss  for those who work to create better conditions for all of us in Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Academic researchers could use the existing museum&rsquo;s  archive of police records from the 1840s onwards. The reference library and  archive allows visitors to find information on ancestors who served in the RIC  and the early RUC. The existing museum also provides a base for the RUC George  Cross Historical Society, which promotes and encourages research into police  history in general.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is a broader significance to the museum, as there is  also a cross-community context and a North/South context, which all sides in  the Assembly would do well to remember. RUC veterans have asked the Irish  Government to help establish a museum to promote and celebrate the history of  policing on the island   of Ireland. The  memorabilia collection to be housed in Belfast  will display uniforms, helmets and weapons that date back to the Royal Irish  Constabulary, the all-Ireland force that kept order between 1822 and 1922.  Exhibitions will also feature the Dublin Metropolitan Police of 1836 to 1925;  the Irish Republican Police of 1920 to 1922, which sounds ironic; the RUC of  1922 to 2001; the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of 1922 to the present time; and the present  PSNI. The whole project was the brainchild of the RUC George Cross Foundation,  which was established in 2001 to commemorate the force that was replaced by the  PSNI. The foundation has gone out of its way and met President Mary McAleese at  &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in, along with members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Historical Society  and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Retired Members&rsquo; Association. In any of those contexts,  it would be reasonable to expect that, eight years after the PSNI replaced the  RUC, a museum to commemorate the RUC should be properly funded and that  building on the project should begin.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Government should honour the commitments given  previously. It would be a bad signal for the whole community if we were to  engage in penny-pinching on the matter. The absolute sums involved are not so  large, and the cross-community context is widely acceptable. I endorse the  motion.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  At this stage of the debate and after having followed so many Members who  support the motion, I do not need to continue with too much detail to make a  case for a museum, as the strong case for it has been related by colleagues.  Not least is the service and sacrifice of the members of the Royal Ulster  Constabulary throughout the Troubles. I consider myself fortunate not to have a  family member on the list that the Member who spoke previously referred to, but  I know many families who have and who still grieve the loss of a loved one. A  permanent exhibitions and fitting tribute to them in the form of a museum would  be only right and proper.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As has been said, the memorial garden is already on site at  Brooklyn. I hesitate to use the word  &ldquo;success&rdquo;, but the attraction of international visitors of some renown to that  site shows how well loved that force was, and its sacrifice has been honoured  by many from far and wide.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The previous Member who spoke made an important point that  should not be missed. He said that the museum would be one of policing in Ireland in its  widest context, from the Royal Irish Constabulary to the Royal Ulster  Constabulary through to the modern day. I have learned that some exhibits of  policing in Ireland  date right back to 1814, but that they cannot get a proper display in the  current &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  The Member made a very positive point about visitor numbers. More than 4,000  people visit the current garden of remembrance each year. That means that,  since the garden opened, more than 20,000 people could have visited an  accompanying museum. Washington  has the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, and other places have memorials. As the  Member rightly said, we are missing a huge opportunity that has significant  tourism potential.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I thank the Member for his intervention, and he is correct. There is a  wonderful memorial garden at Brooklyn, but  there is nothing to tell the stories behind the names of the people that are  inscribed on the tablets that he spoke about earlier.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The case is so strong that it convinced the former  Secretary of State John Reid to commit not only to a memorial garden but to a  complementary museum. In 2001 he said:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The garden of remembrance, along with the RUC Museum  will draw together both projects into a complete RUC experience where visitors  can reflect on the sacrifices of the RUC&rdquo;.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Therefore, he saw the matter in the same way that  I, the Member and others in the Chamber see it. A holistic approach needs to be  taken to the story of the RUC and policing in Ireland. There cannot be a memorial  without a museum or an interpretative centre that tells the story of the people  who are being remembered and of the history of policing in Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Anyone who has seen the existing police museum at Brooklyn  would agree that it is insufficient to exhibit properly artefacts that date  back to the early 1800s and that it is not an appropriate way of telling the  story of the RUC and policing in Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I understand that 8,000 artefacts could be made available to such a museum; I  am sure that the Member is aware of those. I am also sure that he would agree  that that fact complements Ian Paisley Jnr&rsquo;s point that a museum would attract  more tourists. There would be more than an hour&rsquo;s or even two hours&rsquo; viewing in  a museum of that stature.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  The Member is right to say that there is great potential for those artefacts to  be exhibited properly. In the past, my colleague the Member for North Down and  his council tried to have some of the artefacts moved out and displayed in the  North Down Borough Council area. However, they were told that that could not  happen because of the sensitivity of the items. It would be entirely  appropriate for those artefacts to be displayed permanently in an RUC museum.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The other great case for building an RUC museum is that it  would contribute to greater understanding. I know that there are some Members  in the Chamber who would not visit a museum of that kind regularly. However,  deep down, I think that even they would appreciate the point of having an RUC museum  and would know that it would contribute to an understanding of policing in Ireland and,  indeed, our recent history.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In the early part of the decade, the former Secretary of  State promised monetary assistance for the project. A lot of time has elapsed without  any product having come out of that promise. Words come cheap, and it is high  time that that promise was met. Through our work on the Assembly and Executive  Review Committee, other Members and I are aware that the RUC George Cross  Foundation continues to make the case for the project to be granted capital  funding. It has clearly drawn an expectation from the promise that the former  Secretary of State made.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">An RUC museum would exhibit policing in a positive way,  contribute greatly to an understanding of policing and bring obvious tourism  benefits for the people of Northern    Ireland. Everything that can be done,  including feasibility studies and business cases, has been done. The case is  compelling, and, therefore, I support the motion. I call on the Secretary of  State, the NIO, and the Government to fulfil the promise that was made and to  meet the expectation for an RUC museum to be built at the Brooklyn  site.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The debate will continue after Question Time, when we will hear  from the Minister, Mr Gregory Campbell.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The debate stood suspended.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">2.30 pm</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenAnswersHeading"><a name="5"></a>Oral Answers to Questions</p>
      <p class="H3SectionHeading">Health, Social Services &nbsp;and Public Safety</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">North/South Ministerial &nbsp;Council: Efficiency Savings</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mr  Easton </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety what  efficiency savings his Department is making on health issues through the  North/South Ministerial Council.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2651/09>(AQO  2651/09)</a></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: The North/South  Ministerial Council is part of the Belfast Agreement and the St Andrews  Agreement. It was created to take forward work that would be of mutual benefit  to Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.  My Department and the health and social care bodies have undertaken a range of  initiatives with our counterparts in the Republic. The primary aim of that work  is to promote health gain and social well-being for people living in both  countries, and across that work the overriding principle has been to secure  value for money.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  Does the Minister agree that the North/South implementation body should make  efficiency savings, just as his Department must?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I agree. We operate on the  principle of value for money. Mr Easton is probably aware that the Department  of Finance in the Irish Republic and the Department of Finance and Personnel  (DFP) in Belfast  are discussing that. I am required to act according to the guidance that is  issued to me. I am not in control of these bodies; they are jointly controlled  under the North/South Ministerial Council.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Guidance from the Dublin Government is available; we still  await that from DFP. Once that comes, I will be permitted to proceed. It would  be helpful if I were to receive that. I imagine that the Member knows as much  about it as I do.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  I speak as a representative of a rural border area. Healthcare is badly  stretched on both sides of the border. People want to see an increase, rather  than a decrease, in North/South activity.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to efficiency savings, I want to ask the  Minister about the loss of over 700 nursing jobs. Will he tell the House  whether he has taken that matter to the Finance Minister and asked him whether  he will look at some measures to offset that?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: It is not 700 nursing jobs that  are under discussion; it is 700 nursing posts. There is a distinction. The  proposal is that, over the next three years, recruitment for nursing will be  reduced from 2,250 nurses to 1,400. That is the proposal, and it is only a  proposal. It is not hard and fast yet: I am considering it. I stress the vital  importance of nurses, but one cannot run a hospital without a whole range of  other people: porters and cleaners, doctors and consultants, occupational  therapists, speech therapists, administrators, secretaries and so on. They are  all needed in a hospital.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I listened carefully to the debate on 20 April, and an  amendment was made to excuse the Department of Health from having to make  efficiency cuts. That would have saved nursing posts and others. However, the  Member&rsquo;s party and others were keen to vote it down. Despite assurances and  promises given to trade unions that they would support the amendment, they did  not support it. I am where I am. I have this task that I have to complete. I  assure Members that I will consider those proposals most carefully before  reaching a conclusion.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas don Aire as an  fhreagra sin. I thank the Minister for his answer.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">With respect to all-Ireland co-operation and efficiency  savings, will the Minister comment on whether the pilot scheme on GP  out-of-hours services has saved money, and whether he and his Southern  counterpart have plans for further developments or pilot projects?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: As far as cross-border  co-operation is concerned, the overriding principle is mutual benefit. If I can  see benefit to the people of Northern    Ireland, I am prepared to proceed with  practical proposals.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister for Health and Children in the Irish Republic  also takes that view. That is how we assess such matters.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As regards the efficacy of the cross-border GP out-of-hours  pilot service, there have been mixed results. As anticipated, some parts of the  pilot scheme have proven more beneficial than others. However, any decision on  whether we proceed with it will be determined by our experience.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Health Service must make efficiency savings of 3%,  which we find absolutely horrendous. The Health Service should not be asked to  do that; however, it is being asked to do so here. In the Irish Republic,  there has been a straight reduction of 10% in the Budget. A different approach  has been taken in the Irish   Republic, but I am not  quite clear whether the Irish Government will take 10% off the Department of  Health and Children&rsquo;s budget. The total budget for Safefood, the trading name  of the Food Safety Promotion Board, is &pound;6&middot;3 million. I am not entirely clear as  to how much of that will be affected by Irish budget cuts as a result of the  credit crunch and the international economic crisis.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">Caesarean Sections</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mrs  McGill </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety how  many Caesarean sections have been performed in the past five years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2652/09>(AQO 2652/09)</a></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  Ceist uimhir a d&oacute;, a LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I take it that that means  &ldquo;Question 2&rdquo;. I need Jim Shannon here to translate.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The number of Caesarean sections performed in Northern  Ireland hospitals in each of the past five years is as follows: in 2003-04,  5,487; in 2004-05, 5,564; in 2005-06, 6,412; in 2006-07, 7,196; and in 2007-08,  7,149.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The decision to deliver a baby by Caesarean section, either  electively or as an emergency, is based on the clinical judgement of an  obstetrician, who takes account of the medical condition and circumstances of  both mother and infant.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  response. Given the concerns about the increasing number of Caesarean sections,  particularly in the North of Ireland, does the Minister agree that the new  Public Health Agency should inform people, particularly young mothers, about  the implications of having a Caesarean?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Should the Public Health Agency, for example, inform young  mothers that there is an 80% likelihood that their babies could develop  childhood asthma as a result of their having a Caesarean section? Go raibh  maith agat.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: There is a concern that the rate  of Caesarean sections in Northern    Ireland is on the high side. Having said  that, the number of Caesareans performed in Northern   Ireland is approximately the same as the UK average, and is less than, for example, that  in the Irish Republic and other countries. There is a  huge range in the number of incidences across Europe, from around 15% in  eastern Europe to 33% in Portugal  and 38% in Italy.  Our section rate is sitting at 28%, and, certainly, I want to get that number  down. However, the decision to carry out a Caesarean section is based on a  clinical judgement made in discussion with the prospective mother.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We have established a patient safety forum, which will  promote a safety culture, share best practice, support organisations in  implementing evidence-based interventions and measure patients&rsquo; safety. We are  also considering other ways in which to get out messages about Caesarean  sections, some of which the Member mentioned.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I do not envisage the Public Health Agency playing a key  part in that, as it has an altogether different role in health promotion. However,  there is a strong push across the Health Service to provide the type of  information that allows clinicians and mothers to make informed value  judgements.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  The Minister will be aware that, in recent months, some people have criticised Craigavon Hospital, particularly its maternity  unit. I hope that the Minister will join me in taking the opportunity to express  my gratitude for the professionalism of the hard-working, dedicated staff of  Craigavon Area Hospital, particularly given the growing pressures in that area.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Please ask your question.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I readily agree with Mr Gardiner  about the maternity unit at Craigavon   Area Hospital.  It has faced rising pressures due to the increase in the number of births from  just under 3,000 in 2004 to a provisional figure of 3,800 in 2008. Those  figures illustrate the steep rise in the number of deliveries at the hospital.  Much of that rise is due to the mothers&rsquo; preference for Craigavon Area   Hospital because of its  excellent reputation. It has highly professional staff, and its obstetricians  and midwifery unit work together.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I visited the hospital on several occasions, and I have  announced substantial investment in the hospital to ensure that it has the  facilities that it requires and that demand never outstrips capacity. The  hospital continues to operate within its capacity.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  The proposal to establish a midwifery-led unit at Lagan  Valley Hospital  means that less-routine cases, including Caesarean sections, will, in all likelihood,  be transferred to the Royal   Victoria Hospital.  What negotiations are ongoing to enhance the budget and resources of the  maternity unit there to enable it to deal with women who have to undergo  surgery, including Caesarean sections, or other acute interventions?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Lagan  Valley Hospital  was a specific part of my Department&rsquo;s review of services in the Belfast area. I have  asked for a business case to be provided for the establishment of a  midwifery-led unit at Lagan   Valley Hospital.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In Belfast, the Jubilee Maternity Hospital  continues to work within its capacity, and it will receive investment to ensure  that that remains the case. Investment will be made in Craigavon Area   Hospital, whose maternity  unit is also a unit of choice for mothers in the Lisburn area. In the  south-east, the maternity unit at the Ulster Hospital  is a unit of choice, and that will be the case for the new unit in Downpatrick  when it comes into operation shortly.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I examined those issues to ensure that the system has  sufficient capacity for dealing with the expected transfer of some births from Lagan Valley   Hospital. I anticipate,  although I cannot pre-empt the result, that I will receive a positive business  case indicating the substantial use of a new midwife-led maternity unit at Lagan Valley   Hospital.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question 3 has been withdrawn.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">Alcohol-related Deaths</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mr  McCausland </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  what action he is taking to address the increased level of alcohol-related  deaths.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2654/09>(AQO 2654/09)</a></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The increase in alcohol-related  deaths greatly concerns me and my Department. Under the new strategic direction  for alcohol and drugs, a high priority is being placed on measures to address  alcohol misuse in Northern    Ireland. Regional and local action on  education, prevention, treatment and support is ongoing and includes public  information campaigns, targeted education programmes, and continuing service  development. Liquor licensing, alcohol pricing, advertising and accessibility  are also key issues that must be addressed. As part of the young people&rsquo;s  drinking action plan, the entire Executive must give those issues further  consideration.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer. The number of alcohol-related deaths in  the United Kingdom  has risen substantially since the early 1990s, from 6&middot;9 per 100,000 of the  population to 13&middot;3 per 100,000 in 2007. Can the Minister give corresponding  figures specific to Northern    Ireland? Does he agree that the widespread  dissemination of such information would help to highlight the dangers that are  associated with alcohol abuse?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: In 2008, 286 people died as a  direct result of alcohol. That number is rising, and that is a matter of great  concern to me. We are aware that alcohol plays a part in one third of  adolescent suicide attempts. Alcohol has an important impact on health, crime,  antisocial behaviour, personal safety, risk taking, and so on. Society must take  alcohol seriously. If we do not, we will pay a price.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">One of my current focuses is on the impact of alcohol on  young people, hence the young people&rsquo;s drinking action plan, which will  consider minimum unit pricing, and restricting alcohol promotions and happy  hours. Those measures are also being considered in England  and Scotland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">All Departments have responded positively to that action  plan, and some Departments have responded very positively, but the young  people&rsquo;s drinking action plan is, sadly, currently stalled at the Executive. Mr  McCausland would be of assistance to me if he could determine why that is being  held up. The plan would not only have public support, but would have a very  positive impact in pressing down on young people&rsquo;s drinking, which is increasing  all the time.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Alcohol is now 62% more affordable than it was in 1980, and  minimum unit pricing must be considered. Pricing is causing a problem. In England, a  policy of a minimum price of 50p a unit is being considered. Under that  proposal, a half pint of beer could not be sold for less than 50p. That is not  unreasonable, and it is the type of direction in which I want to go.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Notwithstanding the Minister&rsquo;s  answers, have he or his officials had any recent discussions with the Minister  for Social Development on combating easy access to alcohol, considering the  recent debates that have taken place in the Assembly and the proposals that the  Minister for Social Development has claimed that she will bring forward?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: One of the proposals of the  young people&rsquo;s drinking action plan is to establish a cross-departmental  subcommittee to work on that issue. Licensing is the responsibility of the Department  for Social Development, which is actively considering that matter.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The figures on access to alcohol are stark: 81% of  16-year-olds have consumed alcohol, and 27% of young people have purchased it  for themselves at some time. Almost one fifth of those young people buy alcohol  from a pub, 14% from an off-licence and around 5% from shops and supermarkets.  Despite the fact that they are underage, they are accessing licensed  establishments.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In addition to discussions with the Department for Social  Development, I have talked to the police about how to move forward on this  issue. It is a society-wide problem, and one need only look at areas such as  the Odyssey and parts of south Belfast such as the university area and the  Golden Mile late at night to get an indication of how bad things can get. The  events in the Holylands area on St Patrick&rsquo;s day are an example of the type of  behaviour that we must face up to and deal with, rather than run away from.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I am grateful to the Minister for his earlier replies. Does he agree that it is  a matter of concern that there appears to be opposition to his proposals at a  senior level in the Executive? Will he assure the House and me that he will  continue to press for that important change at Executive level, no matter who  is against it?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I am happy to give that  assurance. Indeed, I do so with confidence because virtually everyone in the  House agrees with the direction in which my Department and I want to travel. It  is unfortunate that I have encountered those delays.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s intentions and proposals on untimely alcohol-related  deaths. My constituency is no different from others where there has been a high  increase in alcohol-related deaths, particularly among young males. Is the  Minister aware of a proposal that has been made to the Western Health and  Social Care Trust for a detoxification unit for the Derry  area, which is supported by councillors, GPs and a wide spectrum of people who  are involved in alcohol-education programmes?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I am not aware of the specific  proposal to which Mr Ramsey referred. However, I will make myself aware of it  and will discuss it with him.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">Children with Speech Difficulties</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mr  Storey </strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety to  detail the number of children who have speech difficulties.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2655/09>(AQO 2655/09)</a></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The number of children who have  speech, language and communication needs varies according to the criteria that  are used to assess them. However, it is reasonable to believe that  approximately 3% of all children in Northern Ireland meet the criteria  for specialist help. In a population the size of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s, that equates to  fewer than 13,000 children who are aged between nought and 18 years.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">During the past two years, services for those children have  improved significantly. For example, my Department secured additional  investment of more than &pound;4 million for allied health professional services; an  increase in the number of speech and language therapists from 228 in 2007 to  412 in 2009; and a reduction in waiting times from 26 weeks in 2008 to 13 weeks  in 2009.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, my Department will produce a new speech and  language therapy action plan for consultation and implementation by the end of  September 2009 to drive further improvements in services for those children.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his reply and, in particular, for his and the  Department&rsquo;s intention to launch a speech and language consultation. The sooner  that helpful consultation happens, the better.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister explain what communication there is  between his Department and the Department of Education on the matter? When MLAs  talk to certain parents, they find that they often have difficulty because  there seems to be little co-ordination between the Department of Health and the  Department of Education, not only in identifying children&rsquo;s needs, but in  service delivery.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate that there has been a reduction in waiting  times &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member must ask a supplementary question.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  However, those waiting times must be driven down further.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The speech and language therapy  action plan has resulted from the task force&rsquo;s work. Sadly, that work has been  delayed because the task force&rsquo;s chairperson died in office. The action plan  will be ready for a brief consultation period in June 2009 and ready for  implementation. We are working in conjunction with the Department of Education  to produce the action plan, which is due to be published in September 2009  after consultation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A number of the actions to which I referred are already in  place. Two years ago, during my response to a debate in the House, I gave  assurances that I would take certain actions. For example, I have increased the  number of speech and language therapists; the number of support staff to 66;  and the amount of money that is allocated to those services. I have reduced  targets and ensured that they are met so that no child waits longer than 13  weeks for initial treatment.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is much to be done to the plan as it is brought  forward. One of its key thrusts will be to make better use of existing speech  and language therapists. It is not always a matter of simply recruiting more  therapists. Instead, we must think strategically and carefully about the best  way to use them.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  In light of what the Minister said, why do public representatives continue to  receive complaints from people who are having difficulty obtaining a statement  for their children during their early education periods? I ask that question in  the context of his earlier comments &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member must ask a question.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  &mdash; to the effect that his Department works in conjunction with the Department of  Education.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I suggest that Mr McCarthy makes  those comments during the consultation on the action plan that will begin at  the end of September. Although I have ensured improvements, I do not suggest  that the position is perfect. I regret that parents must wait for long periods,  because children with speech and language needs should receive support as soon  as possible. I take that issue seriously. The consultation will provide an  excellent opportunity for Mr McCarthy to make those points.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an m&eacute;id a bh&iacute;  le r&aacute; ag an Aire, agus cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an phlean gn&iacute;omha&iacute;ochta at&aacute;  beartaithe aige. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s intention to formulate an action  plan. Advocacy groups, such as Afasic, provide valuable support programmes for  young people with speech difficulties. Does his Department support such groups?  Does he intend to enhance that support? Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The role of such groups will, to  a large extent, be determined by the action plan. The consultation is an  excellent way for the Member to make those points.</p>

      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">6. <strong>Mr Cree</strong>asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety what  assessment he has made of the spread of swine influenza.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2656/09>(AQO 2656/09)</a></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I have been advised by the Chief  Medical Officer that on 29 April 2009, as a result of the spread of swine  influenza, the World Health Organization raised its pandemic alert level to  phase 5, which is characterised by human-to-human spread of the virus into at  least two countries in a single World Health Organization region. Therefore,  everyone must ramp up preparations because a global pandemic may be imminent.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Northern    Ireland has already done so and has been  planning for a similar situation for many years. GPs across the country have  been notified, made aware of the symptoms and told what to do if they suspect  that a patient has the virus. Hospitals are well prepared and have specific  plans to deal with a pandemic. We have stocks of antivirals that can be used to  treat those who become ill. Northern    Ireland has robust contingency plans in  place, including plans for acute hospitals, the Northern Ireland Ambulance  Service and social care. Moreover, advice has been issued to GPs and hospital  clinicians.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Cases of swine flu have been confirmed in Europe, including  some in the United Kingdom.  The UK Health Protection Agency continues to monitor events and work closely  with the UK Government to review the ongoing events and assess their threat to  public health in the UK.  The appearance of confirmed cases in the UK  and Europe is not unexpected. Although no  cases have been confirmed in Northern    Ireland, there is no reason to believe that  we will escape the virus.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: I  commend the Minister for his proactive approach to updating everyone on the  swine flu crisis. Has he had regular contact with his British counterparts? Has  he briefed his ministerial colleagues? Given the cost of this unforeseen  emergency, will he bid for additional funding from the Executive?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I confirm that I have taken all  of the action to which Mr Cree refers. I am in constant contact with colleagues  in the home countries through COBRA. Indeed, we had a COBRA meeting this  morning from 11.00 am to 1.00 pm. I will have a further conversation with my  colleagues Alan Johnson, Nicola Sturgeon and Edwina Hart tonight as a wash-up.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The alert is now at level five, and we are preparing for  level six; that is ongoing. I am also having routine cross-border discussions,  and hope to meet Mary Harney shortly.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">3.00 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There will, of course, be a cost implication, which was not  part of my Budget deal. However, that is a conversation that will have to take  place between my Department and my finance director and the Department of  Finance and Personnel.</p>

      <p class="H4StageHeading">Bilingual Road Signs</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mr D  Bradley </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development to outline his plans to  honour the Good Friday Agreement by ensuring that signage on motorways and  major routes is in both English and Irish.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2671/09>(AQO 2671/09)</a></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development (Mr Murphy)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann  Comhairle. My Department&rsquo;s Roads Service has developed a draft policy for the  introduction of a limited range of bilingual traffic signs, with either Irish  or Ulster Scots in addition to English. However, in order to advance the  overarching policy proposal, it must be referred to the Assembly&rsquo;s Executive  Committee, as the issue cuts across the responsibility of a number of other  Departments. The Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure has responsibility for  the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, and the Department of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment has responsibility for tourism. Recently, I  canvassed the views of ministerial colleagues about my proposals, and I am  considering them before I refer the matter to the Executive Committee.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as  an fhreagra a thug s&eacute; ansin. Ba mhaith liom a fhiafra&iacute; de a n-aonta&iacute;onn s&eacute; gur  ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh an polasa&iacute; c&eacute;anna i bhfeidhm anseo agus at&aacute;, mar shampla, i  bhfeidhm sa Bhreatain Bheag agus i dt&iacute;ortha eile ar fud na hEorpa ina  labhra&iacute;tear n&iacute;os m&oacute; n&aacute; teanga amh&aacute;in. Agus ba mhaith liom a fhiafra&iacute; de fosta  cad &eacute; an dearcadh at&aacute; aige den fheachtas at&aacute; ar bun faoi l&aacute;thair ag gr&uacute;pa darb  ainm Na Ceithearna Coille, a ghreama&iacute;onn greamaitheoir&iacute; Gaeilge ar chomhartha&iacute;  b&oacute;thair.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Minister for his answer. Does he agree with me  that the policy applied in Northern Ireland  should be no different from that applied in Wales and in other European  countries in which more than one language is spoken? What is his view of the  campaign being mounted by a group called Na Ceithearna Coille, members of which  target road signs with &ldquo;Gaeilge&rdquo; stickers? Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: My view on what legislative protections should be in  place to support the rights of minority language speakers is clear: I support  the approach taken in Wales  and Scotland,  the legislative protections that are offered there, and the bilingual policy  that is adopted in those countries. I have no issue with that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Of course one supports bilingualism and the promotion of  the Irish language, as was agreed in the section of the Good Friday Agreement  on the promotion of the Irish language in public life. However, defacing signs  may not be the best way in which to go about that. I would like people to  express vocal support for bilingual signage, and bilingualism generally, across  all Departments.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have been consistent not only in raising the issue before  I was Minister, but in following through on it now that I have taken up  ministerial office, and also with regard to my responsibilities under the  European charter. I have been proactive in the Department in ensuring that  there is a multi-lingual website, and that many of the Department&rsquo;s  publications are available bilingually. However, there is much to be done.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Other countries, some of which have been referred to, set a  good standard for us. I do not see any reason why we should not aspire to adopt  those standards here, but I am not sure that stickers should be placed over  road signs, which, for road safety purposes, are generally reflective. Some of  the stickers impair the night-time reflectiveness of the signs. That does not  necessarily serve the purpose that those behind it intend. However, I do  support campaigns for bilingualism.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: Has  the Minister made himself aware of any studies into the safety implications of  motorway signage? Does he agree with me that including Irish and Ulster Scots,  as would be required by the Belfast Agreement, could be a safety hazard on  motorways?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: Other countries have bilingual signage. Earlier this  year I was in Cardiff,  where all the motorway signs are in English and Welsh, and there are no road  safety issues. It is obvious that substantial resources would have to be  expended on motorway signage here. However, the policies adopted and the  legislative protections afforded to speakers of minority languages in other  countries are something that we should rightly aspire to here.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer. In considering the matter, I ask him to  take account of two issues: first, that the relevant section of the Belfast  Agreement has anticipated the Council of Europe&rsquo;s European Charter for Regional  or Minority Languages and has been superseded by that charter, which requires  the promotion of the Irish and Ulster-Scots languages to be taken forward in a  resolute manner; secondly, following up Mr Cree&rsquo;s supplementary question, that  the Minister will take particular account of the research carried out by Oliver  Clarke and Simon Davies from the University of Hull, which was presented to the  British Psychological Society&rsquo;s annual conference in Dublin last year, and  which showed that &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:  Please ask a question, Mr McCausland.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  &mdash; increasing road signage contributed significantly to road accidents.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I am sure that for every study making that conclusion  there will be another showing that increased road signage has no impact. I am  sure that the Welsh authorities took great care to ensure that bilingual  signage did not create more danger for road users. I have been doing my bit,  and I have been proactive in ensuring that my Department meets its  responsibilities to the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.  The promotion of bilingualism here has a long way to go; perhaps we should take  the politics out of it. Legislative support and protection for minority  languages and those who speak them should be no threat to anyone here, and we  should all give it our backing.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brolly</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Seo an cheist at&aacute; agam don Aire:  an dtig leis an Aire a chinnti&uacute; go bhfuil an chumhacht ag an Roinn s&rsquo;aige comhartha&iacute;  dh&aacute;theangacha a chur i bhfeidhm?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will translate that. Will the Minister assure us that his  Department has the power to introduce dual signage? What representations has he  had on that issue from elected Members, including, of course, Dominic Bradley?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: My Department has the power to introduce bilingual  signage, but as I said in my original answer, it is a cross-cutting issue, and,  as such, must be brought to the Executive. Since the Good Friday Agreement was signed,  which is at the root of the original question, until March 2006, only two MLAs,  Alex Maskey and I, contacted the Department about bilingual signage. Since  March 2006, a number of people have contacted the Department on the matter. I  support the use of bilingual signage and I want to secure the support of  Executive colleagues for it. The promotion of Irish or any other minority  language in public life threatens no one, and it should enhance all our lives.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">Infill Development</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Mrs Long </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development for his assessment of the  cumulative impact on local infrastructure of successive infill development; how  this is assessed by his Department as part of the development control process;  and what agreement there has been with the Department of the Environment on  this issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2673/09>(AQO 2673/09)</a></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I should have said that question 2 has been withdrawn.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The divisional development control sections of the  Depart&shy;ment&rsquo;s Roads Service work closely with DOE Planning Service in the  development of area plans. It is at that stage that the cumulative impact on  traffic of infill developments is considered. In addition to that assess&shy;ment,  developers are required to submit a transport assessment form for a proposed  development or redevelopment. Roads Service considers that form during the  planning consultation process. The transport assessment form demonstrates how  the development functions in transport terms and identifies any possible  adverse impacts.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Roads Service may, through Planning Service, request a  full, detailed transport assessment where a development is considered to be  likely to have significant transport implications, irrespective of the development&rsquo;s  size. Infill development, which by nature tends to be relatively small scale,  does not normally require a detailed transport assessment. As part of the  transport assessment process, the impacts of committed developments that have  extant approval have to be taken into account in the analysis. Those  developments that are still under consideration are not taken into account in  such an analysis. When development plans do not provide for the cumulative  impact of developments in an area, Roads Service is required to consider each  individual planning application on its merits.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Each application is examined against the planning policies,  guidelines and site conditions that pertain at the time of the application.  Members will be aware that the regional development strategy for the period to  2025 promotes development on brownfield sites. The strategy defines brownfield  land as:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;that which is, or  was occupied by, a permanent structure within a defined settlement limit.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That excludes the gardens of dwellings and apartments.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Under service level agreements, Roads Service is required  to advise the Planning Service on the suitability of existing roads and  transportation infrastructure necessary to service a proposed development so  that the Planning Service can arrive at a decision on an application. The service  level agreement does not require Roads Service to provide advice on the  cumulative impact of a number of infill developments.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his answer, which was very helpful. I note his comment  about the regional development strategy and area plans. Does he accept that  they are out of date in respect of what is happening on the ground, and that  infill development in back gardens, for example, is not covered? Although such  areas may not qualify as brownfield, they are still development sites.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister agree that there is an issue whereby if  someone applies for planning permission for 40 or 50 houses, a detailed  traffic-impact assessment will be carried out, but if a number of developers  apply for the same number of houses, three or four at a time, a detailed  assessment would not be carried out, even though the impact on infrastructure  would be exactly the same?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The interim review of the regional development  strategy &mdash; and we are engaged in a much longer-term review &mdash; clearly made a  point about gardens as opposed to brownfield sites. That advice was passed on  to the Planning Service to use in dealing with applications. There was quite a  clamour to be more definitive in citing what constitutes brownfield sites and  what constitutes gardens. The interim review tightened that definition up, and  passed that advice on to the planners.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate what the Member said about the cumulative  effect of traffic if a single application is made, as opposed to multiple  applications, but Roads Service and planners can only consider applications on their  merit. They cannot anticipate what may turn out to be further planning  applications. They have to consider applications that are extant when an  application is received. In that respect, they can measure a cumulative effect,  but unless there is a range of applications at one time, it is impossible to do  that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">One cannot measure the possible impact from applications  that may be made next week or next year. That is even more difficult in the  current climate, because many proposed developments have now been put on hold.  It is impossible to anticipate what may be planned, but I appreciate the point  that the Member made. Perhaps when there is reform of the planning process and  more involvement at local government level, some of those matters can be  examined.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>:  Does the Minister share my profound disappointment that his definition of what  constitutes brownfield development, as a result of the review of the regional  development strategy, has had absolutely no impact on the amount of  high-density development in Northern    Ireland? His Executive colleague Mr Sammy  Wilson has confirmed that not a single planning application has been turned  down as a result of the redefinition of brownfield development.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member come to his question?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>: It  is absolutely useless in preventing the cramming that we are seeing in our  towns. Secondly, I share the concern of Mrs Long &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I must insist that the Member come to his question.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>:  Does the Minister share the concern that a development can be turned down only  if it adds 10% to traffic, but one can have 20 developments, each adding 8% to  traffic, and one cannot turn any of them down? Surely that is absolute  nonsense.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: We have made a genuine effort to respond to an issue  that was raised, and to define more clearly the difference between brownfield  sites and gardens. If there was an issue with that, and the planners were not  happy or found that that redefinition was not appropriate or satisfactory, we  should have heard from them, because planners ultimately approve or reject  applications. I do not think that I have heard that from them.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As for cumulative development, I make the same point that I  made to Mrs Long: we cannot make decisions based on anticipation. We can only  deal with and make an assessment on applications that are in front of us. That  is how Roads Service must operate.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If the Member and others perceive a clear problem, I am  more than happy to work with the Minister of the Environment to see how we  could try to make improvements in the context of planning reform, but it is  very hard to deal with planning applications or their impact on transport on  the basis of anticipation.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask Members to please stand clearly in their places so that I  can be certain that they really want to be called. I call Mr Francie Molloy,  who did stand.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  answers so far. Will he state whether the current service level agreement can  be amended to include a qualification whereby Roads Service would have to take  account of the cumulative effect of infill developments?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: Roads Service and the Planning Service are reviewing  the service level agreements, and my understanding is that there are no plans  to make provision for assessing the cumulative impact of infill developments.  However, as I said, this is the place where Members can raise issues that are  important to them, and I am happy to work with the Minister of the Environment  if people think that there is a pressing need that is not being met by the  current planning policy.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">Ballymoney Bus Depot</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mr  Storey </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development what discussions he has  had with Translink about the future of Ballymoney bus depot.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2674/09>(AQO  2674/09)</a></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I have had no direct discussions with Translink about  the future of Ballymoney bus depot. However, I understand that that depot  continues to be a key operational centre in the provision of a network of bus  services to the north Antrim area and, as such, Translink has no plans to  discontinue its use.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  thank the Minister for the reassurance. However, will he give an undertaking  that he will look at this issue in light of the fact that Ballymoney has only a  bus depot &mdash; that is, a place from which buses come and go, but at which members  of the public cannot access them. The actual bus stops are in different  locations in the town. Ballymoney must be one of the few provincial towns in Northern Ireland  that does not have a dedicated bus station, as it had previously. Given the  amount of money that we are told is going to be spent on the facilities at the  railway station, it would seem natural to have a joined-up approach to public  transport by locating a bus station at the railway station, as that would be to  the benefit of all the travelling public.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: What the Member said makes sense; I was not aware of  the exact situation in Ballymoney, and I am happy to raise the issue with  Translink. The Member will understand that the capital budget for Translink is  extremely tight, as are the budgets across all Departments, but I am certainly  happy to raise that issue with Translink.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Bus stations have been brought into operation in different  towns, and they have made a huge improvement to the level of service and to the  number of people using the bus service. Therefore, the desire, intention and  objective of Translink should be to have a bus station facility in all regional  towns. I am not aware of the exact plans for the service in Ballymoney, but I  am happy to take up the matter with Translink.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. The Minister alluded to the fact that  the capital budget is very tight. Will he outline the current plans for capital  expenditure in the Ballymoney area?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The Member will know that work on the railway track  is ongoing in the Ballymoney area, as that has interfered with transport there.  We have given approval for Translink to purchase 20 new trains. That contract  has been signed and the project is progressing, with the first new trains  expected to be in service by 2011. It is planned that 13 of the new trains will  replace the old fleet service, five will be used to increase the frequency and  capacity of the service in the Belfast area, and  two will allow additional trains to be deployed on the Derry  line.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Translink also has plans to relay the track between  Coleraine and Derry, and that work, plus the  additional trains on that line, will facilitate the delivery of an enhanced  level of service when the scheme is complete in 2013. That will mean that the  journey times to Derry will reduce by 30 minutes and for the first time, commuter  services into Derry could arrive before 9.00  am. In addition, as I have already mentioned, the track-life-extension work on  the railway line between Ballymena and Coleraine is being undertaken, and that  is expected to be completed by the end of this financial year.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We have approved a capital grant of over &pound;400,000 to enable  Translink to replace the roof of Ballymoney railway station. The Department has  also made a significant investment in public transport improvements. During the  last financial year, expenditure of &pound;36 million for rail infrastructure and &pound;9  million for bus projects was incurred. Over the next two years, capital grants  of &pound;100 million and &pound;35 million will be invested in rail and bus services  respectively to further improve those services. Given the funding restrictions  that all Departments must try to live with, it is simply a case of prioritising  which projects are undertaken.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  Will the Minister go further in his answer and agree that the accommodation for  train travellers at Ballymoney station is not up to the standard that we would  expect in the twenty-first century? It will not encourage people to use public  transport. Does the Minister agree that there is a need for further investment  there?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I am sure that in every sector of our railway service  we could identify parts that are not up to scratch and could perhaps be more  attractive to passengers. It is quite clearly the case that where investment  has been made, passenger numbers have increased right across the service.  Passenger numbers are up by about 11%, and that is directly due to investment  in facilities and in the trains and the rolling stock. Improving the service,  the comfort and the frequency certainly leads to more passengers using the  service.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am not aware of the exact detail regarding Ballymoney  train station, but I do know that Translink has to try to prioritise capital  works.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The railway station in my part of the world is nearing  completion. However, there was not, in effect, a railway station there; it was  practically a Portakabin. I presume that Translink will prioritise to try to  bring what it considers to be the worst stations up to scratch, and then gradually  work its way through a programme. However, as we have said, even in this  morning&rsquo;s discussion, budgets are tight, and capital investment obviously has  to be prioritised.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McClarty</strong>:  My question was on the long-term plans the Minister had for public transport in  the northern region. He has answered that question fully in response to the  Member for North Antrim. Thank you.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">Corporate Social Responsibility</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mr  McCartney </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development to detail his  Department&rsquo;s policy approach to corporate social responsibility and positive  community impact in the discharge of his Department&rsquo;s services. <a name=AQO2675/09>(AQO 2675/09)</a></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: My Department is strongly committed to corporate  social responsibility and has articulated how it aims to develop that in its  corporate and business plans for 2009-2011. We are also very keen to support  our staff to make a personal contribution to the community. One of the ways in  which we hope to achieve that is through a partnership with Business in the  Community, which would allow us to participate in schemes such as the Talent  Management programme and the Time to Read initiative.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Members will also be aware of the recent Between the  Bridges community-based charity event, which my Department played a role in  facilitating through its corporate social responsibility agenda. We also wish  to enhance areas such as research develop&shy;ment, where we can, through internships  and work placements, make use of undergraduates and graduates to help us with  work associated with promoting sustainability.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is my intention to publicly launch my Department&rsquo;s  corporate social responsibility policy shortly. It is being developed to take  account of the wide spectrum of measures that we will take now and in the  future.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. May I ask the Minister to outline  in specific terms how the procurement procedures in his Department have an influence  on social responsibility and community impact?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: In relation to procurement, my Department follows the  guidance prepared by Central Procurement Directorate and the Equality  Commission on sustainable development and equality of opportunity in  public-sector procurement. In line with that guidance, action plans have  recently been produced at my instruction by Roads Service, Northern Ireland  Water and Translink. Those include proposals for implementing critical community  impact and social objectives, such as increasing access to public-sector  procurement opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises, encouraging  the economically inactive back into the workplace, and encouraging training and  skills development through, for instance, apprenticeships.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, the Roads Service action plan ensures that  social and environmental factors are taken into consideration alongside  financial factors in making procurement decisions. The action plan has a  package of measures to deliver the step change needed to ensure that Roads  Service and its partners are focused on better design, low waste, higher  recycled content, respect for biodiversity and delivery of its wider  sustainable development goals.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answers. Does the Minister agree that his  Department can contribute very positively to the whole economic and social  future of an area when it invests in, for instance, transport structure? Is he  engaged in dialogue at the moment with DETI or the Department for Social  Development (DSD) on how regeneration can take place in a number of towns and  cities across Northern    Ireland?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I agree with the Member that we can have a very  positive impact. When people have argued for where the Executive&rsquo;s resources  should be focused, we have all made arguments about building up the  infrastructure; be that roads, rail, houses, hospitals or schools. Building up  the infrastructure is a very useful way to stimulate economic activity, and in  the longer term also provides us with a solid base of assets going into the  future.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department for Social Development is largely  responsible for regeneration matters and works closely with Roads Service on  its various town centre schemes. I have not had any discussions with the  Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment on such matters, but I know that  officials from a range of Departments work together on larger urban regeneration  initiatives. For example, one will find officials from DETI, DSD, Roads Service  and other bodies working together in the ILEX project in Derry and in some of  the development projects in Belfast.  Such co-operation is happening across the board on specific projects, which is  good. Our form of Govern&shy;ment gives Ministers the ability to interact regularly  on such projects, which is helpful.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question 6 has been withdrawn.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">Rural Transport Services</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">7. <strong>Mr Burns </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development if he is aware of plans to cut  rural transport services and for his assessment of the importance of developing  an integrated public transport service, making it worthwhile for senior  citizens to have free bus passes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2677/09>(AQO  2677/09)</a></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I am aware that Translink has extremely limited plans  to change rural transport services involving a reduction in frequency on three  routes and the withdrawal of one very low-use sub-route in County Derry. There  will be no reduction in the overall bus service coverage in the North.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I fully realise the importance of developing an integrated  public transport service. The Executive&rsquo;s Programme for Government has set a  target for improving public transport provision to deliver a modern, efficient  and sustainable transportation system that facilitates economic growth and  social inclusion across the region.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It continues to be worthwhile for senior citizens to have a  SmartPass. Since the introduction of free travel for people aged 60 and over in  October 2008, more than six million trips have been made, which clearly  demonstrates the benefit of that important scheme.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burns</strong>:  Does the Minister agree that although rural bus services are never likely to  make money, Translink has a responsibility to subsidise public transport in  rural communities?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: Yes. Translink takes that responsibility seriously  and acts on it. It continuously prunes routes in its public transport  provision. That happens on an ongoing basis because, for instance, only one or  two people per week might use some of the routes to which I referred.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As the Member knows, due to the pace of development over  the past number of years, areas not served by public transport may suddenly  gain a couple of hundred houses. Consequently, Translink continuously  reassesses and alters routes. However, it also has a responsibility to provide  rural transport. Such transport is often subsidised and is non-profit-making.  It is part of Translink&rsquo;s public service agreement that it will continue to  provide rural transport.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  Does the Minister agree that a fully integrated public transport system is an  essential lifeline for rural communities?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: Yes. The Member may take issue with the reduction of  some services in the area that he represents. However, Translink has, so to  speak, to wash its face, and if routes are not being used, it does not make  economic or environmental sense to continue them and not provide a service in  other areas that may attract more people on to public transport. The process is  changing constantly, and we look to Translink to continue to provide its  service across the rural routes in the North.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  Free bus passes are only useful where there are available services. Does the  Minister have any advice for senior citizens who have SmartPasses but cannot  use them because there is no bus service nearby?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I am not sure what area the Member is talking about.  However, since last October, six million trips have been made using free bus  passes, which indicates that it is a beneficial scheme. As a representative of  some rural areas where the public transport is not as good as it is in urban  areas, I know that it is more difficult for people to access public transport.  There are other rural community transport projects in a lot of those areas to  try to fill the gaps that there might be in Translink&rsquo;s service. I encourage  those who are eligible for the bus passes to get them and to make as good use  of them as possible.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>:  Will the Minister outline the alternative to the current Translink proposals?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: Translink is developing corporate proposals on how it  goes forward, which have been a matter of discussion with me, the Department  and the Consumer Council. Translink has to sustain itself as a company, so the  choice is between some bus fares increasing marginally and the loss of jobs and  services. Those are always difficult decisions. This is the third time since I  came into office that we have had such discussions. However, those are the sort  of choices that are facing Translink, and I hope that, through consultation, we  can reach an acceptable solution.</p>

      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="7"></a>SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT</p>
      <p class="H4StageHeading">Budget 2009-2010</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mr K  Robinson </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development for her assessment of  the implications of the UK Government&rsquo;s recent Budget announcement for her  Department.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2691/09>(AQO 2691/09)</a></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development (Ms Ritchie)</strong>: The full implications of the Chancellor&rsquo;s  statement are still being assessed. However, I welcome its proposals to give  more help and support in getting people back to work. The statement will also  give additional help to people who are most in need &mdash; children, older people  and disabled people &mdash; in the form of extra benefits, tax credits, child trust  funds and winter fuel payments. My Department will ensure that those who are  entitled to extra benefits will receive them.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am not surprised that additional investment is being  proposed for house building and energy efficiency in Great Britain. Indeed, I have  argued for some time that that is also the right thing to do in Northern Ireland.  Although the Chancellor was subject to unprecedented financial pressures, he  still managed to find an additional &pound;1 billion for housing. I hope that, at the  very least, the Barnett consequential for that will be contributed to our own  housing budget, which is woefully short of funds. The Executive must clearly  signal that they will reprioritise and invest more in housing to achieve the  indisputable benefits, and they must put housing on a firm financial footing  rather than allow construction workers and homeless people to continue to  suffer. The Chancellor has accepted the important fact that investment in  social housing is the best way to boost the economy, while delivering on vital  economic and social policy objectives. Why have we not done likewise?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  I thought that it was my function to ask the questions and the Minister&rsquo;s to  answer them. However, I take her point and her detailed and helpful response.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">What steps has the Minister taken with the Department of  Finance and Personnel and the Minister of Finance and Personnel to ensure that  extra funding can be detailed for the areas that she mentioned? The Minister  knows my concerns about housing estates such as Monkstown where, because of  population movement and the changing population profile, appropriate housing is  not always available to match demand.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: Over recent months, I had several discussions with the  Minister of Finance and Personnel about that issue. The housing budget must be  reprioritised and reprofiled. We can no longer live a hand-to-mouth existence,  surviving off the scraps of quarterly monitoring rounds and the legacy of the  direct rule Administration, whereby the social housing development programme  and associated issues were not put on a sound financial footing. I delivered  that message to the Minister of Finance and Personnel. In January 2009, I  received a helpful response from him, in which he acknowledged the need to  invest in housing. I now want him and my Executive colleagues to reprioritise  and to put housing, once and for all, on a sound financial footing.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  What is the Minister&rsquo;s assessment for the UK taxpayer after her Department  lost a &pound;300,000 legal case?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: That is a ridiculous assertion. For the benefit of  Members, let me put the record straight on that matter. First, I did not pursue  any legal action. Secondly, we did not receive any bills or pay any costs. It  is worth recapping on the fact that the judgement supported me on three of the  four counts.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Let us look at those counts. The first was that I did not  consult adequately &mdash; the judge threw that out; the second was that I had  already made up my mind about cutting the funding &mdash; the judge threw that out;  the third was that I had no right to terminate the contract over UDA behaviour  &mdash; the judge threw that out. Therefore, I make the point again that the court  supported my position on all the substantial issues. The court found an error  in procedure on the ministerial code point. I was aware of that potential  procedural problem and sought the cure, that is, retrospective Executive  approval of the decision. In fact, that is a routine procedure that has already  been used by the DUP. However, when I asked for retrospective sanction, the  Executive refused it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have heard some politicians, including ministerial  colleagues, peddle the accusation that is being made here today, but such cheap  shots diminish not only those who make them but the offices that they hold. The  costs incurred in this case are far more a consequence of Executive decisions  than of any action on my part.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I would also like to point out that the Independent  Monitoring Commission published its latest report last week, and, yet again, it  referred to UDA criminality and to the fact that there had been no decommissioning.  Therefore, in the broadest sense, I was right all along. My decision was right  then, and it is still right now.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: To  return to the Budget, will the Minister confirm that it is her view that the  &pound;116 million in Barnett consequentials that the Executive will receive over the  next two years should be invested in economic recovery through social housing,  energy efficiency and renewable energy, that it should not simply be offset  against the &pound;123 million in efficiency savings that have been asked for, and  that those should be funded in a different way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank Dr Farry for his intervention. I will come back  to the initial point. There needs to be a reprioritisation of the housing  budget, and emphasis needs to be placed on putting housing on a sound financial  footing once and for all. We are dealing with a legacy from the direct rule  Administration, which is not helpful at all. Through the operation of the  Barnett formula, an additional &pound;116 million is available for the Northern  Ireland Executive this financial year and the following financial year. I will  seek to ensure that my Department shares in that increase to assist with the  various pressures that are being encountered in the housing programme and throughout  the social security office network as a result of rising unemployment.  Therefore, I cannot agree with you more.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Minister to make her remarks through the Chair.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">Welfare Reform Bill</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr  McClarty </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development when she expects to  propose a legislative consent motion on the Welfare Reform Bill.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2692/09>(AQO  2692/09)</a></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: A legislative consent motion is required when the  Westminster Parliament intends to legislate on an area that falls within the  competence of the Northern Ireland Assembly. The British Government will not  include provisions in a Westminster Bill dealing with devolved matters unless  the Northern Ireland Executive have agreed to it. Such provisions can be retained  in the Westminster Bill only if the Northern Ireland Assembly has agreed to it  by passing a legislative consent motion. There is no requirement for a  legislative consent motion for the British Welfare Reform Bill, as it does not  seek to legislate on matters that fall within the responsibilities of the  Northern Ireland Assembly.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McClarty</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her response. Will she assure the House that her  Department will prepare for Members a detailed synopsis of the Bill, with  particular emphasis on the aspects that affect Northern Ireland before the  legislative consent motion is introduced?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: Mr McClarty raises very pertinent issues in relation to  the prospective Welfare Reform Bill. We are taking on board all the issues that  are being debated in Westminster, and there are  ongoing discussions with Ministers in Great Britain and with Ministers in  the devolved Administrations and their officials concerning its impact. I will  certainly take on board the Member&rsquo;s submission, and I will come back to him  directly.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle, agus go raibh maith agat, a Aire.  How does the Minister believe the Welfare Reform Bill will affect the uptake  and provision of benefits across the Six Counties?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: The Bill&rsquo;s proposals are wide-ranging, and I understand  that many of them will be piloted and evaluated before being introduced. The  Member knows that, under existing parity arrangements, I must bring forward  similar proposals, particularly in respect of provisions that relate to benefit  conditionality. In so doing, I will ensure that the equality impact of the  Bill&rsquo;s proposals is assessed fully and that full recognition is given to the  need to protect the most vulnerable in our society. That is because I believe  firmly that all of us are duty-bound to protect the most vulnerable. I will, therefore,  assess the Welfare Reform Bill in that context.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  Does the Minister have any concerns about proposals in the Welfare Reform Bill?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I am concerned about the fairness and practicality of  some aspects of the Westminster  proposals. For example, I believe that the proposition that benefit recipients  with addiction problems be required to undergo treatment as a condition for  benefit qualification poses all sorts of questions. I will consider all those  and other matters.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">Disability Living Allowance</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Mr Brady </strong>asked the Minister for Social Develop&shy;ment, in relation to the Disability  Living Allowance report brought forward by the DSD Committee, for her  assessment of the recommendations leading to an improvement in administration  of the allowance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2693/09>(AQO 2693/09)</a></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: Members are aware of my views on welfare entitlement. I  am determined that every person who is entitled to support under the welfare  system receives all that to which they are entitled, not least DLA, which  involves decisions on entitlement that have an impact on vulnerable people.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Independent commentators recognise widely that disability  living allowance is an especially complex benefit to administer. Nonetheless,  mindful of the clients that it serves, I have set challenging public service  agreement targets for DLA. Therefore, I am pleased to report that last year&rsquo;s indicative  results represent the Social Security Agency&rsquo;s best DLA performance since the  benefit&rsquo;s inception in 1992. Subject to validation by the Northern Ireland  Audit Office, the agency achieved financial accuracy of 99&middot;7% against a target  of 98%. It also achieved an average claims clearance time of 41 days against a  target of 47 days. I am sure that Mr Brady agrees with me that that is a highly  commendable performance that is worthy of acknowledgement.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Notwithstanding that, we are not complacent. During the  debate last October in the House on the Committee for Social Development&rsquo;s  report on the administration of disability living allowance, I welcomed and  commended the Committee&rsquo;s work and acknowledged that the resultant  recommendations were helpful as we strive to drive through even more  improvements. I have since sent a memorandum of reply to the Chairperson of the  Committee for Social Development containing my detailed response to each of the  recommendations, the majority of which I have accepted. My officials will  continue to update the Committee for Social Development on the remaining  recommendations, on which work is progressing.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her answer. Does she agree that there are still glaring  inconsistencies and problems with the interpretation of medical conditions when  decisions on DLA are being made?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: Mr Brady raised the issue of medical conditions. I want  to make the point very clearly that disability living allowance is paid as a  contribution towards the extra costs that severely disabled people face as a  result of having a long-term disability. Entitlement depends on the effects  that the severe physical or mental disability has on the need for personal care  and the ability to walk.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The reliance on effects, rather than the disability itself,  ensures that all severely disabled people have equal access to the benefit,  whatever the causes of their disabilities. There is no doubt that disabilities  and a person&rsquo;s health can affect their ability to walk and to do certain  things. It differs with each person; nobody is the same in that regard.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her response. Mr Brady was right in what he said  because the paperwork is off-putting. Does the Department have any intention of  reviewing the paperwork and of simplifying the questions that are asked in the  paperwork? That is important.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is not sufficient for the Department to draw the  conclusion that a person can walk, can self-help and can self-care if a GP  states that the person&rsquo;s disability is not known. Will the Minister give an  assurance that a review of the paperwork and the application form will be  undertaken and that full information in relation to the applicant will be  considered?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I think that Mr Shannon is referring to the initial  application form that a person submits to ascertain whether they are entitled  to disability living allowance or to ascertain the band within the various  limits to which they are entitled. Notwithstanding the length of the form, I am  very conscious that many claimants incur great difficulties and challenges when  they are faced with such forms. I do not disagree that that is a very daunting  task.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A new, shortened DLA claim form was introduced last  November. Key customer representatives such as Citizens Advice, Advice Northern  Ireland,  the Law Centre and Disability Action were consulted on the design. They  provided very positive feedback. I am sure that the Member is aware that the  Social Security Agency also provides support for customers who need help with  filling in DLA forms through face-to-face services or telephony.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am still open to any other suggestions of ways to help  people to complete forms and to reduce the problems or challenges that they  face. In most instances, I fully take on board that people apply for DLA because  they suffer from a disability. Work is also under way to examine the DLA  renewal claim form that is in use with a view to reducing its length.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Following on from the Minister&rsquo;s statement about forms and given the  disproportionately large number of people in Northern Ireland who claim DLA  compared to other regions of the United Kingdom, will the Minister assure us  that sufficient controls are in place to ensure, even with the new shortened  forms, that only people who are fully entitled to DLA are able to make claims?  If all that is taken into consideration, does she expect the long-term trend of  the number of DLA claimants to rise or fall?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I think that Mr Basil McCrea expects me to look into my  surveyor&rsquo;s glass and make a prediction. The number of applicants and claims for  disability living allowance in Northern Ireland  is much higher than regions of Great    Britain. However, we must ask ourselves what  the reasons are for that. Perhaps there are greater levels of disability. We  have to be sensitive to those issues. I cannot predict whether levels will  increase, but I am sure that officials in the Social Security Agency will adopt  a rigorous approach, along with medical practitioners and the examining medical  practitioner, to assessing application forms.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Of course, if someone is unsuccessful, an application can  be made to have a case reconsidered, and, if that is unsuccessful, he or she  can appeal the decision, although, for many people, that can be a fairly  daunting task. If a person is still unhappy as a result of an unfavourable  appeal, it is possible to go, on a point of law, to the social security  commissioner. Therefore, every possible avenue is open. I am assured, however,  that staff in the Social Security Agency adopt the most rigorous process. I  want to be sensitive to vulnerable people who are in need, because we meet such  people every day.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">Housing Executive: Maintenance Grants</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mr  Molloy </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development for an assessment of the  number of building firms and contractors that will be affected by the shortfall  in the Housing Executive maintenance grants.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO2694/09>(AQO  2694/09)</a></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: We are all aware of the &pound;100 million shortfall in the  housing budget for this year. However, broadly speaking, there has been no  significant change in the allocation for the Housing Executive&rsquo;s revenue  maintenance programmes. In fact, the Housing Executive has already advised its  Egan contractors that it will be releasing programme maintenance starts worth  &pound;16 million.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In the present economic crisis, I feel strongly that we  must adapt and focus our efforts on the areas that can deliver the greatest and  most rapid stimulus to the economy. I have seen strong evidence from senior  economists that increased investment in social housing is one of the best ways  to keep businesses afloat and skilled workers in jobs.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">House building offers a higher economic multiplier than  larger infrastructure projects. It creates or sustains more jobs than other  options, and it spreads the benefits over a wider geographical area. I am  convinced of the need to increase investment in social housing to stimulate the  economy, protect jobs and help those in housing stress, and I will continue to  lobby my Executive colleagues for their support for my proposals. If I am  successful, I will make every effort to use that invest&shy;ment to boost the  economy.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I cannot assess how much the shortfall in the housing  budget will impact on individual construction businesses, but I am doing  everything in my power to maximise the work that is available to the sector.  For example, I have instructed the Housing Executive to plan the newbuild  programme using a much greater proportion of land and sites &mdash; commonly known as  transfer sites &mdash; that it already owns, and, consequently, more of the available  money will go directly into construction work and wage packets, instead of into  land purchase costs.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. I thank the Minister for her answer. Does she agree that  maintaining the present housing stock must remain a high priority, because any  reduction in that stock would add to waiting lists?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: Mr Molloy&rsquo;s question highlights the most fundamental  requirement of the social housing development programme. Whether that involves  newbuild or planned maintenance programmes, it must be placed on a sound  financial footing. No more must the housing programme be subject to a  hand-to-mouth existence, based on scraps from the quarterly monitoring rounds.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will continue to try to persuade my Executive colleagues  to reprioritise the housing budget. I have commissioned the University of Ulster  to carry out some useful research in that respect, which I will publish  shortly. There is no doubt that investment in social housing development  programmes is an investment in one of the most labour-intensive industries, and  it is a significant &mdash; perhaps the best &mdash; way to stimulate the local economy,  create and provide a social asset and address social housing need.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Armstrong</strong>:  I agree with the Minister&rsquo;s analysis that the Housing Executive requires a lot  of money. What encouragement has the Minister received from the Minister of  Finance and Personnel that funding will be found to enable her to move forward  with her plans?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: Mr Armstrong has again highlighted the need for  financial investment in the social housing development programme.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Perhaps, no Department has been affected by the fall in  capital receipts as much as DSD, but, that said, we must make every pound go  further with regard to the transfer sites. I am encouraging the Housing  Executive and the housing associations to build on their own land, thus making  the pound stretch further.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have continually told the Minister of Finance and  Personnel that we need to reprioritise the housing budget and that the  hand-to-mouth existence to which the social housing development programme has  been subjected through its receipt of scraps from quarterly monitoring rounds  must be stopped. I have also presented those sentiments in documents to the  Executive and to my ministerial colleagues. Housing is fundamental to the lives  of everybody. We are duty-bound to address housing need throughout Northern Ireland,  wherever it comes from.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I received a helpful letter from the Finance Minister back  in January, and I noted that he met the Housing Council following a meeting  that I had with that organisation. He published a statement and took on board  and recognised the need for investment in the social housing development  programme. It is to be hoped that that recognition and acknowledgement will be  translated into a reprioritisation and that an investment of funds for the  social development housing programme will be given number-one priority.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I heard what the Minister said  about investment in housing and construction being not only a significant  factor in regeneration and the creation of jobs, but, primarily, in putting a  roof over people&rsquo;s heads. There has been a significant fall in capital  receipts. Will the Minister outline the consequential pressure points in  respect of the housing spending programmes and their delivery?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I have prioritised the social housing development  programme to ensure that we meet the target of 1,750 newbuild social homes and  to protect the most vulnerable in our society through fuel poverty measures,  such as the warm homes scheme. It is inevitable that the shortfall will have an  impact on all the other housing capital programmes, with the main pressure  points being private sector grants, Housing Executive multi-element improvement  schemes and extensions for those requiring disabled adaptations.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The biggest factor is the collapse in private sector house  building. However, the housing associations and DSD are increasing house  building through the social housing development programme. About two years ago,  we were only going to build 600 houses, but, at the end of last year, we had built  1,595, and, this year, I am determined to ensure that we build 1,750, in spite  of this year&rsquo;s &pound;100 million shortfall and next year&rsquo;s &pound;100 million shortfall.  Therefore, it is important that we place housing on a sound financial footing.  That is why I commissioned research from the University of Ulster.  I want to ensure that we put housing on a sound financial footing and that we  secure the resources from the Executive to ensure that we address the needs of  those who are most vulnerable and that we help those in the labour market and  the construction industry and, above all, those in housing need.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">Village Regeneration Programme</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Ms  Purvis </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development for an update on the  regeneration programme for the Village area of South Belfast.  &nbsp; <a name=AQO2695/09>(AQO 2695/09)</a></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: Last February, I announced plans for a &pound;100 million  regeneration of the Village that will transform the housing stock there through  a mixture of demolition, newbuild and refurbishment. The Village was declared  an urban renewal area in April 2008, and, since then, work has been ongoing to  acquire those properties where advance purchase was requested. To date, 112  applications for advance purchase have been received, and agreement has been  reached on 100 of those. Subsequently, the vesting application was lodged with  my Department on 27 November 2008, and 116 objections to it have been received.  Those are being dealt with by the Northern Ireland Housing Executive.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Village regeneration project is the largest single  project on our books at the moment. It is a complex process, and not all the  groups or individuals living in the area are in agreement about the details. I  am pleased to have taken the initiative to get the redevelopment under way in  an area that has some of the worst housing left in Northern Ireland, but operational  matters are principally the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Housing  Executive.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Purvis</strong>:  Since the Minister is aware of the serious effects of multiple deprivation in  the Village, can she give an assurance that the regeneration programme will be  prioritised by her Department and rolled out in this Assembly term?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: The very fact that we declared the Village an urban  renewal area &mdash; and funding starts the minute an area is declared as such &mdash; and  that work is ongoing shows our commitment to the project and the impetus behind  it.</p>

      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Debate resumed on amendment to motion:</p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly supports the suggestions for an RUC Museum  at Brooklyn Headquarters near to the Garden of Remembrance; and calls on the  Northern Ireland Office to allocate the necessary funding to enable building to  begin during 2009. &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Mr Shannon.]</span></p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Which amendment was:</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Leave out all after &ldquo;Assembly&rdquo; and insert:</p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;notes the proposal for an RUC museum; believes that methods  to acknowledge the past, including the role of the RUC and the different  experiences of policing over the years, should be developed; and recommends  that the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure, the Policing Board, the  Police Service of Northern Ireland, the Commission for Victims and Survivors  and the future victims and survivors forum should consider the matter.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Mrs D Kelly.]</span></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure has indicated that he  wishes to respond on matters contained in the amendment.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure (Mr Campbell)</strong>: I followed the debate, as I am  sure other Members did, with great interest, given the complexity that would  arise as a result of much of the discussion contained therein. I welcome the  proposal to establish a policing/RUC museum. At present, policing is a reserved  matter, with responsibility for it falling to the Northern Ireland Office. In  whatever year the devolution of policing and justice may occur, I expect that  responsibility for a proposed policing museum would transfer to the proposed  new Department of justice. It would then be a matter for that Department to  consider any business proposals put forward for the creation of a policing  museum.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Most Members who spoke this afternoon said that they had no objection in  principle to the establishment of a policing museum or to the history of  policing on the island   of Ireland as a whole.  Indeed, some Members, particularly those from the Ulster Unionist Party, said  that they believed that the proposal provided a means of creating  cross-community support.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP in no way diminishes the sacrifice of many men and  women over many years, and, in particular, over the past 30 to 40 years, when  all too many of them paid the ultimate sacrifice. In recent months I visited  the garden of remembrance, which was quite a poignant experience. I urge  members of all communities to visit that garden and to note the names and  stories behind the memorials. The only record that tells the story behind some  of those names is a book on the Troubles; other than that, unless one has  personal experience or knowledge of the circumstances in which some officers  lost their lives, there is no other means of telling their stories.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Members from Sinn F&eacute;in and other parties pointed out that  there should be a way of telling our story. One of the recommendations of  Bertha McDougall&rsquo;s report on support for victims and survivors focused on  storytelling. Mr McCartney is a member of the management committee of the Museum of Free Derry, and he told us how important  it was for people to be able to tell their story in their own words as they  remembered it. All Members, right across the Chamber, recognised that there are  differences in our experiences and in how we tell our story. There is history,  story and historical facts.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">No one is disputing the fact that there is general support  for how we best remember the past. The SDLP amendment tried to set it in the  context of the Eames/Bradley group and the wider storytelling, and the  recognition of the many victims of the Troubles.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Paisley Jnr, who is no longer in the Chamber, made  comparisons between pygmies and giants. There can be no diminution of the  SDLP&rsquo;s role in policing. The SDLP was the giant that led the way for the support  of police reform across the nationalist community. For Mr Paisley to enter such  a comparison into this afternoon&rsquo;s debate is an absurdity. He said that our  amendment is about dillying and delay. That is not what the amendment is about.  The SDLP amendment is about realities and the economic situation that Northern Ireland,  and many nations across the globe, face today. Mr Paisley said that it shows  that we falter and fail.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Here we are at the start of another week with no Executive  business before us, there is no Executive business next week, and there was no  Executive business last week. People are playing at electioneering, and Mr  Paisley accused our party of doing that in moving the amendment. He should look  to himself first, and if that is how he measures up dilly, delay, falter and  fail, those words could, quite reasonably, apply to the Executive. In the  Minister of the Environment&rsquo;s statement earlier today, he referred to four  occasions on which, he alleges, Sinn F&eacute;in blocked progress at the Executive.  The two main parties need to sort things out. I stress that it was Mr Paisley  who entered such words into this afternoon&rsquo;s debate.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party spoke about the need to build a museum  to recognise the worst of our past but, quite reasonably, recognised that one  person&rsquo;s remembrance is not the same as another person&rsquo;s remembrance.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member please draw her remarks to a close?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  We have handled this afternoon&rsquo;s debate maturely, and the SDLP amendment set it  in the reality of today&rsquo;s economic climate.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>: I  declare an interest as Chairperson of the Assembly and Executive Review  Committee, which is considering the financial implications of the devolution of  policing and justice, and the museum issue was raised in recent evidence.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will go through some of the issues regarding a new  policing museum and put them into the context of how the situation has been  spun out by the Northern Ireland Office. As other Members have said, a new  museum was announced in 2001 by the then Secretary of State, John Reid, in  conjunction with the creation of the RUC GC Foundation. PSNI estates services  initially submitted a business case to the Northern Ireland Office in November  2002, with projected costings of &pound;9 million. That figure allowed for the  completion of a memorial garden by 2004. Various sites were considered,  including: Seapark; the proposed new policing college at Cookstown; Belfast city centre; the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum;  and the Knock Road  headquarters on the basis of a joint heritage site with the garden and with  shared staffing and costs.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The RUC GC Foundation runs on a small annual budget of some  &pound;160,000, and most of the work is carried out by volunteers who work in the  existing museum and who could work in a new museum. It was then agreed that  PSNI estates services would withdraw from the agreement, and the RUC GC  Foundation, in conjunction with the Northern Ireland Office, commissioned an  independent feasibility study by a firm of museum consultants.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">All stakeholders were consulted on the outline design case,  and a business case was put together at a projected cost of &pound;5 million, which  represented a reduction of &pound;4 million. The business case was submitted to the  Northern Ireland Office in mid-2006. It included a further study of audience  numbers and greater justification for the museum to be located on the Knock Road site,  which the Northern Ireland Office said that it needed in order to put a robust  case to HM Treasury in 2006.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The audience development plan was completed by another firm  of consultants, and the RUC GC Foundation took the precaution of conducting a  further independent site analysis. Again, that pointed firmly in favour of the Knock Road site.  Critically, the audience development plan suggested that the museum should have  a major educational and outreach role in relation to reconciliation and  healing. It also recognised the importance of the museum being a living museum  depicting the history of policing in Ireland, from the RIC to the RUC  and through to the Police Service of Northern Ireland, because no other such  museum or establishment exists.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As a number of Members have said, there are 8,000 exhibits  being stored. Some of them are vehicles, a couple of which are on show at the  Ulster Folk and Transport   Museum. Other exhibits  date back to the early 1800s. Some of them are very valuable and need to be on  display.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The RUC memorial garden has a history trail that leads one  through policing from 1814 into the garden where the names of those who died,  both in the earliest troubles and in the more recent campaign, are inscribed.  It is early days, but, as has been said, I hope that the name of Stephen  Carroll, who tragically lost his life in the first terrorist attack since the  formation of the PSNI, will be included in that garden at some point. I am sure  that there will be discussions with the family in that regard, and I hope that everyone  in the House will encourage that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The business case, including the independent reports, was  submitted to the Northern Ireland Office in late 2007. However, to the  amazement of the RUC GC Foundation, the Northern Ireland Office stated that it  required the written approval of the Policing Board and the Chief Constable in  relation to the Knock Road  site. As Ian Paisley Jnr indicated, the Policing Board agreed unanimously to  that on 11 March 2008 and the Chief Constable gave the Police Service of  Northern Ireland&rsquo;s approval on 30 April 2008.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">After the business case had been processed further by a  consultant, it was submitted to the Northern Ireland Office again in September  2008. Once again, the Northern Ireland Office has tried to stall the issue and  has tried to divert the whole plan away from the Knock Road site. As my colleague Jim  Shannon said, a very small museum, which was originally situated at the  reception area of the old Brooklyn  headquarters, has been moved to a small office close to the entry gate of PSNI  headquarters. That museum is totally inadequate and, as has also been pointed  out, very few people know that it is there.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The business case was submitted for the final time on 18  November 2008, and it was believed that it would come before the Northern  Ireland Office board in January 2009. Regrettably, that did not happen, and  there were further meetings and administrative queries from the Department of  Finance and Personnel on 23 March. So the whole scenario goes on. The final  report of the Oversight Commissioner, in May 2007, also identified the  construction of a museum &ldquo;adjoining the garden&rdquo; as a remaining issue of the  Patten proposals. There have undoubtedly been a whole series of events to  stymie the idea of having the museum there.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As many in the Chamber have said, this is an important part  of the history of policing in Ireland.  It is something that will be of immense importance, because the plans that have  been submitted provide for an amphitheatre for educational purposes within the  museum. The PSNI will be able to use it; it is something that they lack in Belfast. The Assembly  Education Service attracts schools on a daily basis from all sides of the  community and further afield. A police museum would be a widely used facility.  As has been pointed out by others, it could be used for tourism and to attract  people.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am heartened that there are no serious objections, but we  oppose the SDLP amendment. It would further stymie the project. This is a  legacy issue that the Northern Ireland Office should sort out.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member will please draw his remarks to a close.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>:  It is a historic issue that needs to be settled, and I commend the motion to  the House.</p>

      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Main Question put and agreed to.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That this Assembly supports the suggestions for an RUC  Museum at Brooklyn Headquarters near to the Garden of Remembrance; and calls on  the Northern Ireland Office to allocate the necessary funding to enable  building to begin during 2009.</p>
      <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="9"></a>Children Missing from Care</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30  minutes for this debate. The proposer will have 10 minutes to propose and 10  minutes to make a winding-up speech. All other Members who wish to speak will  have five minutes. One amendment has been selected and published on the  Marshalled List. The proposer of the amendment will have 10 minutes to propose  and five minutes to make a winding-up speech.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly notes with concern the failure of the  Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety to monitor and maintain  baseline figures relating to the number of children who go missing from care  and the number of such incidents per child; demands action to address the lack  of access to specialist therapeutic support services for these children across  all Health and Social Care Trust areas; recognises the pressure on police  resources and time in retrieving these children; calls on the Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety to place greater emphasis on the  needs of missing children and to ensure that his Department accurately accounts  for these children in its role as corporate parent; and provides a clear  strategy and resources to address the reasons for these children going missing  and the risks to which they are exposed during their absence.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am disappointed that, for the second time in two weeks,  the Minister is unable to attend the Chamber for this debate. However, this  matter is too important to be delayed again, and I will proceed this time in  his absence.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I note that the last delay afforded the Minister&rsquo;s  colleagues time to draft an amendment. I am content to accept that amendment.  However, I cannot say that I am entirely happy. The purpose of the motion is to  highlight a basic and fundamental gap in current practice in the Department. The  Minister and his officials know that, hence their inability to answer the  questions that have been posed. It was essentially agreed that the amendment  should be the topic of an all-party motion to be tabled at a later date,  following the debate on the substantive motion.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion was generated as a result of my concern at the  experiences of some of the most vulnerable children and young people in our  society. In Northern Ireland,  almost 2,500 young people are in care, many of whom have stable placements and  quality care. However, we all know that the overall outcomes for those children  are likely to be poor.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department assumes the role of corporate parent of  children in care, and therefore has the mantle of responsibility. According to  the most recent figures, it remains a shameful fact that care-leavers are still  18 times more likely than other young people to leave school without any  qualifications. In addition, more than half of all care-leavers, 53%, left  school without gaining qualifications, compared with 3% of all other  school-leavers in Northern    Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Only 12% of young people leaving care obtained five or more  GCSEs, as opposed to 65% of pupils overall. That obviously has an additional  knock-on effect, given that young care-leavers are also four times more likely  to be unemployed than those of a similar age in the population.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I know that strategies and approaches are in place to  address the needs of children in care and that that can happen only over the  longer term. In particular, I welcome the publication of the White Paper &lsquo;Care  Matters: Time for Change&rsquo; and the specific educational support schemes that  have recently been put in place. However, I remain particularly concerned for a  much smaller number of children and young people whose vulnerability and risk  are drastically increased by their experiences of running away from residential  homes, and, less so, foster-care placements.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Experience here and in the rest of the United Kingdom  tells us that, without doubt, children who go missing from care are subject to  greater risks, including drug and alcohol misuse, sleeping rough and being  sexually abused and exploited by adults who prey on their vulnerability.  Reports by Extern, Barnardos and the Children&rsquo;s Society all identify a young  person&rsquo;s going missing as the most immediate indicator of sexual exploitation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Since December, I have asked the Minister on three separate  occasions and in three different ways to provide figures for the number of  children in Northern Ireland  who go missing. I am concerned that unless we are clear about the number of  incidents of children who go missing from care and their patterns of risk, we  will not be able to even begin to solve this problem. Keeping an accurate  record of the number of children who go missing from care and the number of  incidents per child are important indicators of children&rsquo;s safety and  vulnerability.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am aware that there is currently no legal requirement for  those statistics to be kept or analysed, and I am genuinely concerned at that  serious legislative gap. It does not seem too much to ask that vulnerable  children be identified so that they can be helped. My understanding is that  unless a child is missing from care for 24 hours, trusts will not have a record  of them having gone missing. It does not take 24 hours for children to be at  risk or come to harm.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Of the 2,500 children in care, only 13%, or 319, are in  residential care. Last year, there were 325 reported notifications of children  absconding from care. That is the only year for which I can find any figures.  Although that clearly includes multiple incidents of individual children who go  missing, I must register my concern that the figure is significantly high.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The PSNI has confirmed that, in 2007-08, there were 4,956  incident records for adults and children who went missing. A total of 616 of  those had an address at a children&rsquo;s home. The lack of information means that  it is not clear how many of those cases were repeat incidents and how many  children they represent.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Retrieving children who go missing from care on a repeated  basis represents a substantial investment of police time. Extern research shows  that, in Northern Ireland,  one in 10 children will run away from home, but it also shows that children in  care are nearly five times more likely to run away overnight than those living  in families.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">They are also more likely to have had more than one episode  of running away. Some 32% of young people who had spent time in care had run  away three times, compared with only 13% of children who had never been in  care. The research also indicates that running away is associated with  mental-health difficulties, offending, and the use of alcohol and drugs.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Research and experience from the rest of the United Kingdom  shows that children who repeatedly go missing are vulnerable and at risk.  Repeatedly going missing from care is one of the most important indicators of  increased vulnerability, as was recognised in the Department of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety (DHSSPS) report &lsquo;Our Children and Young People &mdash; Our  Shared Responsibility&rsquo;, which expressed concern about the repeated instances of  children going missing, and about whether social workers and the police have  sufficient resources to deal with them.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The report also identified the risk of sexual exploitation,  whereby children in residential care were targeted and subjected to abuse by  adults who knew that they were vulnerable. Some may accept children going  missing from care as the norm, but would any of those who are parents in the  Chamber accept that as the norm for their child?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A recent report by the House of Commons Committee on  Children, Schools and Families argued that the state fails as a parent because  it does not demand enough from services. Two essential demands must be made: to  know when children are missing, how many times and why; and the recording and  analysis of all that information to ensure that care becomes a better  experience for children.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I know of one current example of a young girl aged 14 who  regularly goes missing from care, where she has been living since the age of  nine. From a young age, she witnessed significant domestic violence and alcohol  abuse in her family. Over the past year, she has been going missing from the  children&rsquo;s home and staying away for increasingly long periods, usually from  8.00 pm to between 3.00 am and 5.00 am. Each time she goes missing, the home  reports the incident to the PSNI. She often returns in a dishevelled state and  is subsequently too tired to attend school. It is strongly suspected that she  has been under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs. I am not implying that  her story is shared by a substantial number of children in care, but it is by a  few. For one child to have that experience today in Northern Ireland is one too many.  Unless the experiences of such children going missing from care are rigorously  recorded and analysed, it is too easy not to see the child&rsquo;s real story.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In response to the recommendations contained in &lsquo;Our  Children and Young People &mdash; Our Shared Responsibility&rsquo;, the Department  published guidance in April 2009 that seeks to ensure that the PSNI and staff  in children&rsquo;s homes work together to protect children. The guidance introduces  a traffic-light system that recognises the difference between children who  return late and those who are missing and, therefore, at risk. I ask the  Minister to confirm what, if any, multi-agency training is being put in place  to ensure that the PSNI and social care staff are clear about how to implement  that guidance.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">To my knowledge, only one specific support service for  children exists; it operates in the east of the Province and is partly funded  by the Department. To date, in the first nine months of its operation, some 23  referrals have been made from that one area. Will the Minister tell the  Assembly whether he plans to invest additional resources in specific services  for children who go missing from care? Is he familiar with the young runaways  action plan that was published in England  and Wales?  That plan seeks to provide support to children and prevent them from running  away from home or care. Does the Minister plan to consider such a strategy for Northern Ireland?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have seen the project to which the amendment refers in  operation in Manchester.  I am, therefore, aware of the need for such a project in Northern Ireland.  However, for such a project to be implemented here requires the basic measures,  such as accurate record keeping, to be in place. That is the primary motivation  behind my motion. I am glad that the Ulster Unionist Party, by accepting the  motion, albeit with an amendment, recognises the need for the Department and  other agencies to do more.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will write to the Minister to advance the issues that are  raised in the debate. Given the clear legislative gap that I highlighted, I will  consider the merit of introducing a Private Member&rsquo;s Bill. I hope that the  Minister will support me in that initiative.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  beg to move the following amendment: At end insert</p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;; furthermore notes the danger of sexual exploitation that  children missing from care can face; notes the successful approach of the  Manchester Safeguarding Children Board &lsquo;Protect Team&rsquo;, and calls on the  Northern Ireland Office to ensure that the Police Service of Northern Ireland,  in conjunction with the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  and the relevant voluntary sector organisations, provides an enhanced Protect  Team for Northern Ireland with a view to preventing the sexual exploitation of  children and young people.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I declare an interest as a member of the Carrickfergus  children and young person&rsquo;s locality group. Barnardo&rsquo;s paid for my travel costs  when I visited Manchester  with other MLAs to observe the work of the Protect team.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Member for tabling the motion. It highlights  the issue of children who go missing from care, the need for improved support,  and the need to record and analyse the experience of such children.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion calls for more resources and for the Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety to place greater emphasis on the  needs of vulnerable young people. It calls for a clear strategy and for  resources to be made available to address the reasons why those children go  missing. That is all very laudable.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Let us chart where we are and where we have come from. In  May 2007, the Economic Research Institute of Northern Ireland published the  report &lsquo;An Analysis of Public Expenditure on Children in Northern Ireland:  Part 1: Spending on Children&rsquo;s Services&rsquo;. It revealed that, in 2004-05, less  was spent on each child in Northern Ireland  than in other parts of the United    Kingdom. It showed that 28&middot;6% less was spent  on each child than in England  and 33% less than in Wales.  The proportion of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s personal and social services budget that  was spent on children amounted to only 14&middot;1%, compared with 24% in England and  26&middot;1% in Wales. During direct rule, the Department of Health, Social Services  and Public Safety underinvested significantly in children&rsquo;s services, which  received significantly less funding than similar services in the rest of the United Kingdom.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion fails to recognise the significant developments  that have taken place in the children&rsquo;s sector in recent years. The &lsquo;Families  Matter&rsquo; strategy document, which was published in March 2009, is particularly  relevant to the debate, as is the Care Matters strategy. I understand that the  early draft of &lsquo;Care Matters&rsquo; was delayed for several months during the Sinn  F&eacute;in/DUP spat last summer. That means that progress on the matter has been  delayed because of politics.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  noticed that the Member criticised the wording of the motion because it does  not mention the positive progress that has been made. However, given that the  amendment does not refer to that either, does that mean that the Member is  critical of his own amendment?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  am conscious that we have all failed in the area, and I did not wish to say  that no further improvement is needed. No one can ever say that, when it comes  to children going missing, they do so at a satisfactory level.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased to learn that the &lsquo;Care Matters&rsquo; document has  been finalised, that it has been with the Department of Health, Social Services  and Public Safety, and that it has now been passed to the Executive for final  approval.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">What is the relevance of those documents? They are relevant  because, if families who are at risk are supported, fewer children will enter  care. The evidence is clear: children who are in a caring family environment  have a much better chance of reaching their full potential than those who are  placed in care. Children who are outside the care system are also less likely  to go missing. In addition, a wide range of new investments is being made in  services for children and young people who are in care.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that those omissions from the motion are not a sign  that children&rsquo;s issues are being used for party political purposes to attack  the Minister. It would be helpful if the proposer of the motion would advise  the House about when &mdash; or whether &mdash; she has written to the Minister or sought a  meeting with him on the matter.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The all-party Assembly group on children and young people  received health officials at its March meeting, and we were advised of progress  on the Families Matter strategy. That strategy acknowledges that parents are  best placed to support children. It advocates strengthening universal services  and developing services for families that need extra help. A further &pound;2&middot;4  million in recurrent moneys is attached to the strategy.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Last week, Fergal Bradley from the Department of Health,  Social Services and Public Safety briefed the all-party Assembly group on  children and young people on the Care Matters strategy. He and his colleagues  must be complimented on the progress that has been made to date, but more must  be done.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Care Matters strategy has been developed with input  from key partners, including the Department of Education, which educates the  children; DEL, which helps some of them to go to further education; the Department  for Social Development, which has a role in their getting housing; OFMDFM,  which is responsible for children&rsquo;s matters; the Northern Ireland Office; the  Youth Justice Agency; and the voluntary sector. Each of those bodies has a  degree of responsibility for children and young people in care, and, by making  changes, they can improve the lives of and outcomes for those vulnerable  individuals.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Safeguarding and information sharing is a key issue that  has been highlighted, and piloting arrangements for the collocation of social  work staff in the PSNI public protection unit is suggested. An  information-sharing protocol is being developed, and, if it is to be meaningful,  it is obvious that statistics such as those relating to children who are  missing from care will be a key indicator. That should have been done in the  past, and it must be ensured that it is done going forward.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Additional money is available to invest in family  intervention services that are consistent with the Families Matter agenda. If  we are to afford a better future for our children and young people, it is clear  that a range of improvements will be required, with the co-operation of all the  bodies that I mentioned.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion refers to the risk to which children and young  people are exposed during their absence from care. It is vital that the  Assembly identifies one of the main risks, which has been mentioned earlier;  namely, the sexual exploitation of children and young people. It must propose  measures to deal with that, which is why I tabled the amendment.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Some people might suggest that sexual exploitation of  children does not happen in Northern    Ireland. I will tell Members of my  experience of visiting Barnardo&rsquo;s Beyond the Shadows project in Belfast over a year ago.  The project worked with some of the most marginalised young people in Northern Ireland.  During the meeting, a case worker had to leave the room to take a telephone  call from a young girl who was alone in a locked room and did not know where  she was. She had gone out with people whom she thought were her friends.  Clearly, those people were not her friends. She was being exploited.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Vulnerable young people, particularly those who are in  care, seek friendship, contact and close liaison with others. Therefore, they  are particularly vulnerable to unscrupulous men. Indeed, a recent edition of  the &lsquo;Sunday World&rsquo; revealed that young girls in east Belfast had been given drink and drugs by  older men, who then exploited them.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Before Easter 2009, Barnardo&rsquo;s took other MLAs and me to  visit the Manchester Safeguarding Children Board&rsquo;s Protect team. Its model  involves close partnership working between police, social services and the  voluntary sector. It is recognised as being successful at proactively  preventing sexual exploitation of children and is being replicated across  greater Manchester and, indeed, further afield  throughout the United    Kingdom.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A social worker leads on case planning, undertakes direct  work with young people and their families and is the key link worker with  individual homes. Police gather evidence and intelligence. They also use  preventative strategies, such as warnings under section 2 of the Child  Abduction Act 1984 and section 49 of the Children Act 1989. I want to know more  about those warnings: how often, if at all, are they used in Northern Ireland?  Of course, the voluntary sector supports young people and raises awareness of  the dangers of being drawn into sexual exploitation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The group of MLAs was told that some 54 warnings under the  Child Abduction Act 1984 had been issued in the Manchester programme. Only two of them had  been breached. Therefore, most people who attempted to draw vulnerable young  people into a dangerous situation had heeded the warnings because of the  severity of punishment. Have any such warnings been issued in Northern Ireland?  If not, what changes are necessary to enable that tool to be used here? Are new  protocols and regulations needed? The Assembly needs to hear from the police on  the matter. I hope that all parties who have responsibility for it will get  together and talk.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is a 90% conviction rate in cases that the Protect  team have taken to court. Significant statistics are available. During a  six-month snapshot in 2007, 62 young people who had been referred had gone  missing 769 times. Post-referral, they went missing only 276 times, which  represents a 64% reduction. As regards children from care specifically, 22  looked-after children had been missing 312 times. Those are the sort of figures  that one might expect to emerge in Northern Ireland. There is no  reason why Northern Ireland  would be significantly different from elsewhere. That figure was reduced by  21%.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Many children continue to go missing. We must recognise  that young people cannot be stopped from leaving a home. They must be  encouraged and supported to stay. In extreme cases, a secure detention order  can be used. I understand that such an order has been used recently in Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, the benefits of a multi-agency team include  better access to information; better understanding of different agencies&rsquo;  roles; information sharing; better knowledge; and improved outcomes. How would  such a team be comprised in Northern    Ireland? Perhaps, it would be comprised of a  dedicated PSNI sergeant and two constables; social workers from the Department  of Health, Social Services and Public Safety; and a voluntary sector  practitioner.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member should draw his remarks to a close.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  ask Members to support the amendment, which calls for measures that have proved  successful elsewhere.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I welcome the substantive motion  and commend its proposers. I also take on board the reasoning behind the  amendment, because it is right that the Assembly deals with kids who go missing  from care.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The amendment deals with realities, such as sexual  exploitation, and highlights the need for a joined-up approach to address the  matter. As the mover of the motion said, the House should not divide on this  serious issue. The Assembly should send a coherent message to the Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety and his officials.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I had intended to commend the Minister &mdash; credit where  credit is due &mdash; on the work that he and his officials have carried out to date.  However, the Minister is not attending today&rsquo;s debate. Given that he was  dealing with the swine flu crisis, I could have accepted a postponement last  week. His failure to attend today sends a negative message about the importance  of vulnerable children to him and his Department. I hope that the health sector  does not go to the wall because of swine flu.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">For the record, other Ministers have shown the capability  and commitment to deal with crises in their Departments and have had the  manners to participate in and listen to debates in the Chamber, most notably  Michelle Gildernew during the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease and  bluetongue. During Mr Beggs&rsquo;s contribution, it struck me that Michelle  Gildernew is able to multitask because she is female. We must consider the Minister&rsquo;s  failure to respond to a 90-minute debate on a serious issue that affects human  beings.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">During his speech, Mr Beggs made several excuses about  Every Child Matters and the children&rsquo;s strategy; this month&rsquo;s excuse is swine  flu. Last month and the previous month, the excuse was the lack of Executive  meetings. I patiently await next month&rsquo;s excuse.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  The document will be completed. I understand that it is now with the Executive.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Other documents from the health sector and the Department did not sit on desks  because the Executive was not meeting. Mr Beggs is well aware that he is  politicking on an issue that affects vulnerable people.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">My minute of negativity is now over, and I commend &mdash; I have  only a couple of minutes left &mdash; the mover of the motion and my colleagues who  tabled the amendment, because the issue affects the most vulnerable in society.  We are failing children and young people in care, some of whom are there through  no fault of their own. The state is supposed to be their parent. It is  important that the original motion does not simply demand that we monitor and  deal with kids who go missing from care, rather than wait 24 hours before  anything kicks in. I doubt that the provision that will kick in after 24 hours  is what is required.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Moreover, the state has failed to address some serious  issues that affect kids in care. We need to consider that matter and adopt a  joined-up approach to ensure that, when young people become part of the care  setting through residential care, foster care or other types of care, society  has a proactive package to deal with their emotional, physical, educational and  health needs and protect them from exploitation. Mr Beggs mentioned the &lsquo;Sunday  World&rsquo;. Every week, that newspaper contains stories of how older people prey on  our most vulnerable. We need to stop that behaviour. We should not wait 24  hours before we decide if a person is vulnerable. Children who go missing from  care are in a vulnerable position.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have no problem with the issues that are outlined in the  motion and the amendment. As Mr Beggs said, the PSNI and the Department need to  work closely. When children are returned to care homes, nobody asks why they  absconded in the first place. We all know of cases in which children are  brought back but go missing again the next day. We need to create a joined-up  strategy to deal with kids who go missing and are vulnerable in the community  and to ask why they decide to go AWOL.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I accept the Member&rsquo;s point that the Executive have been  considering issues of housing and social justice. There is an onus on the  ministerial subgroup that deals with children and young people not to create  more work for the Executive that will provide an excuse for their lack of work  on the matter. They need to focus on the issue with a collective responsibility  and reach a collective outcome.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Kids are in care, some of them because they are vulnerable.  We must ensure that we take away that vulnerability and stop others from  exploiting them. I commend the motion and the amendment.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  I am sure that we can all agree in the House that the most important commodity  that any country can have is its children. That is what we need to concentrate  on today; that and what makes a child run away from care. If a child is not  happy in care there is definitely something wrong. Our care system is supposed  to protect and nurture in the absence of parental influence for whatever  reason.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Looked-after children are nearly always the most vulnerable  children. They have had experiences that some adults may never have in their  lifetime. They will nearly always need support even when they leave care. How,  then, does the child who has run away cope alone outside the care system? They  are exposed to the increasingly familiar drug rings, the sex trade and the  child-trafficking business. They are at most risk from themselves, and the fact  that they often have had no previous sound family experiences to draw upon  means that they do not instinctively sense whether an experience is good or  bad. Any form of affection or consideration, misguided or not, is often a  welcome caller to the looked-after child.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We were recently horrified by the brutal details that  emerged from the case of Baby P in the UK and the lack of occupational  investigation by those charged with protecting the vulnerable in society.  However, we are here today not to dig around the whys and wherefores of such a  case but to examine the preventative issues which should ensure that we never  see another Baby P and that those in positions of trust are armed with the  necessary manpower and can utilise a fully accessible database of information  and complaints that, when consulted and acted upon, should make the experience  of a looked-after child or young person a more helpful and friendly one. In  turn, that should create a more stable and pleasant care environment, leading  to a reduction in the number of runaway episodes, which are common at present.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The entire system must be examined. The provision of care  and the recruitment and allocation of social workers to individual cases must  be reassessed and, more importantly, the workload of social workers must be  addressed. In the past I have had occasion to approach social services about  children who are on the child protection register, only to be met with what I  can best describe as a nonchalant attitude to what I considered a serious  situation. The shift in attitude must begin at the heart of social services,  not with the paperwork. My local social services workers, although very approachable,  have an extraordinary workload. It is neither helpful nor wise to place the  lives of vulnerable children and young people in the hands of overworked people  with a serious morale issue.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I admit that there are obvious time and financial  constraints involved in retrieving a child who runs away. However, the real  change will come only when we can identify what makes children go missing in  the first instance. Children need to be protected and looked after but not only  in status. They need to be looked after by social services in a true parental  manner, not in a pitiful manner. Children and young people are not an item that  we can throw away or recycle. We get one chance at life, and it is a lottery  for most of us.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Good records and good administration are essential, but  true care is what is needed. The interdepartmental approach is what will guide  this issue and form the best response to the problem. The solution is a matter  not just for the Department of Health, but for the entire spectrum of the  Executive. Children&rsquo;s lives are mapped right across each and every Department  in the Executive. It is wrong to lay the responsibility at the door of one  Minister; it is a shared problem, in what the Assembly likes to refer to as a  shared society. A shared problem needs a shared solution. It also needs  financial support, so that what is needed for children in care can be implemented.  I support the motion and the amendment.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: I  thank the Members who brought the motion to the House and those who tabled the  amendment. It has already been mentioned that the absence of the Health  Minister is a major disappointment in the context of this debate. I agree with  Sue Ramsey; I do not believe that his presence in the Chamber for an hour and a  half as a courtesy to Members would have significantly set back his response to  swine flu.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am also disappointed that, being part of an overall  Executive, no other Ministers were willing to respond to this important debate,  given its cross-cutting nature.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  This matter was raised at a Business Committee meeting that I attended. The  Minister could probably explain it, but my understanding is that it is up to  Ministers, if they are going to be absent, to request that an individual stand  in for them. Therefore, the Minister in question has a veto. Indications were  made that Mr McGimpsey did not want any other Minister to stand in on his  behalf. It is not a question of the unwillingness of the other Ministers; it is  because Mr McGimpsey is not prepared to allow anyone else to speak on his  behalf.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>:  The Member&rsquo;s point is welcome, because it highlights the issue of whether or  not the Executive are functioning in a joined-up fashion. The two junior  Ministers in OFMDFM are tasked with dealing with children&rsquo;s and young people&rsquo;s  issues, and it is unfortunate that arrangements could not have been made in the  Executive to ensure that there was some response to the debate. I will not get  into a discussion about who blocked that. I am simply stating that, as a matter  of record, it is disappointing. Mary Bradley is right to say that the issue of  children missing from care is cross-cutting and extremely important.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Some of our most vulnerable young people are also among the  most stigmatised in society. In many cases, the emphasis that is being put on  the role of the police can lead to a perception in the community that young  people who are living in children&rsquo;s homes are involved in illegal activity. I  agree with the proposers of the motion that those issues must be handled with  great sensitivity.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Many young people are in care homes to be protected from  dangerous, abusive or destructive environments. It is crucial that the  Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, in its role as a  corporate parent, ensures that risks to young people are significantly reduced  and that they are properly managed while they are in care. Young people must be  safe, not only from the threat of external harm and exploitation but from their  own dangerous self-harming or risk-taking behaviour, which may happen because  of significant levels of distress.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion calls for the extent of the problem to be  monitored. We need statistics if we are to determine the scope of the problem  and know whether to respond and to what degree and whether that response is  working. Practitioners to whom I have spoken in the run-up to the debate have  suggested that the risks to which children are exposed when they go missing  vary quite dramatically, depending, partially, on how long the absence lasts  and how frequently those young people are absent.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The perception that has been built up by monitoring  statistics in England and Wales is that,  when young people are absent for longer periods, they are at risk of much more  serious harm. However, statistics on young people who are repeatedly absent are  also a high indicator that those children are at risk of sexual exploitation in  particular. In Northern Ireland, it is assumed that, on the basis of people&rsquo;s  knowledge of the children with whom they work, young people are often absent  from care for shorter periods. Their carers know where they have gone, because  they return to family, a relative, a friend or a hang-out, and people know  their whereabouts. The difficulties arise when that behaviour is addressed. A  lack of proper monitoring and intervention makes it difficult to change that  behaviour.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is also a small but vulnerable group of young people  comprising children in care who have been trafficked or who have sought asylum  as minors without adult supervision. Those young people are more likely to  disappear from the system than any other group of young people. They are hugely  vulnerable, because they have no adult supervision or support networks.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">No one will deny that sexual exploitation of young people  is a significant issue. However, their physical safety, their vulnerability to  crime and their health are also important, particularly if they are repeatedly  going missing and are living rough. Interviewing returning children is,  therefore, crucial, because it identifies the reasons behind the episode, helps  to inform future care and gives the right level of support to those young  people and the people who work with them.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The use of police resources has been raised, and we have to  concede that dealing with children missing from care is a drain on those  resources. From time to time, that issue has been raised in my constituency in  cases involving difficult circumstances. No one will argue that anything other  than non-contact methods should be used in children&rsquo;s homes. A young person can  be reasoned with before he or she leaves if a carer knows that it is going to  happen, but there is little that one can do to prevent them from leaving care.  Alternative methods, such as locking the facility or introducing contact  methods, have the potential to raise issues of trust with young people and the  legal liabilities of staff. There are huge sensitivities around the issue. It  also raises the issue of whether we want our care homes to become, more or  less, secure facilities. We do not. Not all those young people need that level  of protection. Once a child goes missing from care, there is very little option  but to engage with the police &mdash; not to do so may result in serious consequences.  The police are the only people with the power to return those children.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member draw her remarks to a close?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: We  need a more coherent strategy, and I hope that the Minister will assure us that  we will get one. Unfortunately, in the absence of statistics, it is hard to see  how that will be achieved. In Wales,  it has been shown that people living in families are less likely to abscond and  be at risk.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">This is Foster Care Fortnight. If more work were done on  that front, we could deal with many such issues in a more sensitive way.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  commend my colleague for moving the motion.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  has an unenviable and undistinguished record of maintaining proper records on  vital issues of public concern, and we should not lose sight of that. There is  a great deal of blame passing and saying that it is someone else&rsquo;s fault. I am  surprised at the number of times that Ministers come before the House &mdash; when  they do come before the House; on this occasion, the Minister of Health has not  &mdash; to use the excuse that an issue is cross-cutting or that they are part of a  four-party mandatory coalition, almost as an excuse for not doing their job.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Let us focus for a moment on the responsibilities of the  Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety. We note particularly  that the motion highlights:</p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;the failure of the Department of Health, Social Services and  Public Safety to monitor and maintain baseline figures relating to the number  of children who go missing from care&rdquo;.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is not the responsibility of any other  Minister. We could probably give the Minister of Health some latitude if this  were the only issue on which he does not maintain suitable records and  information. I will list some of the issues that my colleagues asked the  Minister about in recent months: the number of patients transferred to  hospitals outside Northern Ireland due to a lack of beds or personnel;  departmental records of the amount of public money spent on hospitality; the  number of children with speech difficulties; the number of patients presenting  at accident and emergency departments who were told to go home and come back  the next day; the percentage take-up of the flu vaccine; and the incidence of  hospital-acquired pneumonia.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>:  Will the Member add to that list that there are no records kept on staff  assaults in the Health Service or of the outcome of prosecutions that are pursued  or whether boards have supported the staff involved?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  thank the Member for her intervention. I tabled a question asking what records  are kept in accident and emergency departments in relation to domestic  violence.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. The motion is on children missing from care. I ask the  Member to stick to the motion and not to digress.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Not that I would ever question the ruling of the Chair, but I have to set the  debate in some context. We are talking about the Minister &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order, order. I have allowed the Member a degree of latitude to  set the debate in some context. I ask him to return to the subject of the  debate.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  return to the subject of the debate. The answers were: &ldquo;unavailable&rdquo;, &ldquo;not  kept&rdquo; or we were told that an answer could be provided only at disproportionate  cost.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The lack of proper records on children missing from care is  not just a failure of good government; it is a failure of basic care. That is  why the debate is timely and important. If children go missing &mdash; particularly  from children&rsquo;s homes &mdash; that is a failure of officialdom. It is also a  ministerial failure.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is absolutely no point in blaming the system. That  defence has not worked for MPs&rsquo; expenses claims, and it will not work here. The  system needs to be changed. It does not need to be changed to please Members;  it needs to be changed to address the needs of children in the months and years  ahead.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">5.00 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Nobody would ever say that it is best for any child to grow  up in care; it is absolutely far better for a child to grow up in a loving,  caring family environment. We witnessed recently how the Children&rsquo;s  Commissioner concluded that it was better to place a child in care and  criminalise its parents than to have that child grow up in a home where parents  use physical discipline. However, apart from that kind of ideological aberration,  most people would conclude that it is far better for a child to grow up in a  loving, caring environment.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately and regrettably, that is not always possible.  When that is the case, the care system should be supportive of the child,  should be supportive of the establishing of good relationships and should do  everything possible to make that child feel valued, loved and cared for. Often,  when a child runs away from either a care home or his or her own home, it is  because that has become an established practice and something that is easy for  the child to do.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In many cases, tension surrounding the break-up of a family  &mdash; as the result of a divorce or separation, for example &mdash; has been very high up  the list of reasons that children run away. However, if the Department&rsquo;s set  response does not involve an acknowledgement of that fact, how does that help  the child&rsquo;s growth and development? Clearly, it does not.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I would have made that point to the Minister today, had he  been present, but, unfortunately, he is absent. We need to know whether the  Minister is prepared to put in place the appropriate information to tell us  exactly what the case is. It is past the time for excuses and ministerial  absenteeism; it is time for action on the part of the Minister. I support the  motion.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  I support the motion and the amendment.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Today&rsquo;s debate has brought to the fore many of the worrying  concerns about the safety of young people in care. The figures that have been  referred to indicate that, at present, approximately 2,400 children are in care  in the Six Counties, with approximately 57% of those placed with foster carers  and around 13% placed in residential care. Those figures are certainly  startling. We all recognise that where it has taken responsibility for  vulnerable children, the state needs to do more to ensure that those children  are safe and have a better life.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I take this opportunity to commend the good work that  foster carers do in our communities. They provide a loving and caring  environment and emotional support for the children who are placed in their  care.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Members have said that no centrally held accurate  statistics exist on the number of children who go missing while in care. No  statistics are available that state the overall number of those children who go  missing on multiple occasions. We are told that those statistics are difficult  to gather, as some people may go missing for short periods. In her contribution  to the debate, the proposer of the motion outlined how there is no legislative  requirement to keep such statistics. If the Department is serious about keeping  those children safe, we need to gather that information to ensure the best  provision for those children, who are most definitely in need.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Barnardo&rsquo;s, jointly funded by the Department of Health,  offers a limited service that is aimed specifically at children missing from  care. That service, to which Members referred earlier, is located in the  Eastern Health and Social Care Board area. Children who are not in that area do  not have the same access to the specific therapeutic support to address the  risks and difficulties associated with repeated instances of missing children.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Of the core issues that have been outlined in today&rsquo;s  debate and in the Members&rsquo; briefing from Barnardos, one is that those children  who are repeatedly missing from care are some of the most vulnerable in our  society. Another is that the lack of centrally held information on the issue  makes it very difficult to analyse and address. Another is that there is no  comprehensive monitoring system or strategy in place to address those issues,  and that has implications for effective service planning.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As Members have said also, there are clear indications that  for a small but significant number of children and young people, there is a  link between being missing from care repeatedly and instances of sexual  exploitation. Those are serious issues of concern. Today&rsquo;s debate has  highlighted many issues, and we need to see action.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The amendment refers to examples of good practice in Manchester; specifically,  the Manchester Safeguarding Children Board&rsquo;s Protect team.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We must look to those examples to inform us in developing a  clear strategy to prevent harm to vulnerable young people in care. As has been  clear from the debate, we need a cross-cutting strategy to identify and tackle  the issues, and we look forward to that being taken forward on a  cross-departmental and cross-statutory basis.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion and the amendment.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  Like other Members, I commend the proposer of the motion and my colleagues who  tabled it. It would be remiss of me not to express disappointment that the  Minister is not in the Chamber to be with us on such an important subject. All Members  appreciate the significance of the swine flu problem, but it beggars belief  that he could not spare an hour and a half to be with us on such an important  subject.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Does the Member not accept that a Minister would need a great deal more than an  hour and a half to prepare for such an important debate? It is not just a  question of a Minister turning up in the Chamber and taking part in a debate.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  Given that the Minister does not appear to have done a great deal on the issue  and having listened to some of his replies, one wonders how long he would have  prepared for it.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  have already given way once.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  I will take only 20 seconds.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: OK.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  The Member may agree with me that the Minister thought that it was important to  come to Question Time but not to this debate because the former was live on TV.  That highlights the problem.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: In  the words of a fictitious politician of a while ago:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;You may very well think that; I couldn&rsquo;t possibly  comment.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It beggars belief that the Minister is busy 24/7 dealing  with swine flu; one wonders how the country copes when he is asleep at night.  How are we not overwhelmed by swine flu? I am also disappointed that there do  not appear to be any departmental officials in the Chamber, although that may  be a symptom of the Minister&rsquo;s absence. I am also disappointed that the motion  is needed. As my colleague Michelle McIlveen said, she pressed the Minister  with questions on the issue on three occasions, and the information was not  forthcoming.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Leaving that aside, I welcome the motion and the amendment.  I agree with other Members that the amendment slightly puts the cart before the  horse, and there are vital things that need to be put in place before we can  move forward on it. However, the amendment offers a welcome way forward, which  is something to embrace.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As Mr Beggs and Mr Storey said, we all share a belief that  a family environment is best for children. Providing whatever support that we  can to families is of benefit to society in human and economic terms. Mr Storey  also acknowledged that that is unfortunately not always possible with every  family, and that in many cases, children end up in care because their family  circumstances are simply inappropriate. For example, mention was made of sexual  exploitation; unfortunately, the vast majority of sexual exploitation happens  in the home. Consequently, we are left with a large number of children in care.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As the proposer of the motion said, statistics on the issue  are scant. However, police statistics show that a disproportionate number of  missing children are in care, which is why they should be the focus of our  attention. As Naomi Long said, before we can provide concrete solutions to the  problem, we need to know its scope. Consequently, it is vital to have robust  statistics and records to highlight patterns in the disappearance of children.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That is not simply an academic exercise: missing children  are vulnerable to being led into activities that are harmful to themselves and  to society. It has not been mentioned, and I do not want to dwell on it, but  there are two sides to the problem; society as a whole suffers when children  are led into criminal activity.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In my constituency, a care home and a juvenile justice  centre are in close proximity, and for many years, residents who lived close by  suffered from antisocial behaviour. Although the juvenile justice centre often  got the blame for that, in practice a wide range of children was involved, and  very rarely were any of them directly connected to the Rathgael site.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Society suffers as a result of such criminal activity.  Perhaps more so, however, children suffer. Vulnerable children are led astray  into a range of activities, be it crime, drinking, drug-taking or sexual  exploitation. The protection of those vulnerable children must be foremost in  our mind.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mention was made of the fact that we have, at least as a  first step, some level of model that can be rolled out across Northern Ireland.  That does not preclude further steps being taken. Again, we have the example of  what operates in the former Eastern Health and Social Services Board area.  However, we are witnessing one bit of good practice in one former board area  that is not being repeated elsewhere. As was the case in the debate that the  Assembly had some time ago on autism, in which a range of board responses to  adult autism was revealed, with some boards being more proactive than others,  here is an example of good practice that has effectively been ring-fenced by  one health board.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Member to draw his remarks to a close.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: We  need to adopt a much more joined-up approach. &lsquo;Our Children and Young People &mdash;  Our Shared Responsibility&rsquo; outlines a positive way forward. That needs to be  implemented, and we need to have the statistics available so that the problem  can be tackled for the sake of the most vulnerable children. I support the  motion and the amendment.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  I support the motion and my colleagues&rsquo; proposed amendment. I preface my  remarks by making some important observations. Today&rsquo;s motion is the  fifty-fifth private Members&rsquo; motion that the DUP has tabled on health. It comes  after the Minister has made 14 statements to the House, answered 3,500 health  questions and steered no fewer than five Bills through the Assembly. That  represents a workload four times greater than that of the closest DUP Minister.  When will the DUP give the Minister time to manage his Department? The Minister  of Health is in the midst of managing a swine flu crisis &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. As I did with Mr Storey, I ask the Member to return to the  motion&rsquo;s subject matter, which is &ldquo;Children Missing from Care&rdquo;. Thank you, Mr  Gardiner.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for drawing my attention to that point, but some  statements, which I feel need clarification, were made earlier in the debate  about the Minister&rsquo;s actions. The Minister is active, and it is worth noting  that among those who are criticising him for not being here today is not one  single DUP member of the Health Committee. Where are they? They should be here  supporting their colleagues, but none of them is here.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Why was the subject of the debate not brought before the  Health Committee? Why, indeed, did the Health Committee fail to meet last week?  The answer is that it could not get a quorum. I received a telephone call to  say that, apart from me, only three Committee members were available to attend  the meeting: my colleague Mr McCallister and a Sinn F&eacute;in Committee member.  Therefore, we could not hold a Committee meeting. It would have been much more  constructive to have brought the matter of children missing from care before  the Health Committee for mature discussion rather than try to grandstand with  yet another health debate. The subject chosen for debate was deliberately  emotive, and its timing deeply inappropriate. We are now not simply having  debates on health but debates on children.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">All those DUP health debates cast aspersions on the  professionalism and dedication of the many excellent health professionals in  the Health Service.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order, order. Mr Gardiner, it is time to return to the subject matter  of the motion, please, which is &ldquo;Children Missing from Care&rdquo;.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  I again thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for reminding me about that, but certain  matters must be highlighted, such as the DUP&rsquo;s hypocrisy in its attacks on the  Health Service.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Our main concern is for children who go missing from care.  I support the motion and the amendment.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">5.15 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>: I  support the motion and the amendment.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The fact that children go missing in Northern Ireland  is a huge concern for everyone who is involved in the protection of children.  Although it is the responsibility of the Department of Health, Social Services  and Public Safety, it is a much wider societal issue, and it requires far more  family support, early support and early intervention. However, the fact that  the Health Department does not have adequate records for children who go  missing from care is very worrying. There is no baseline data, so it is  impossible to measure the extent of the problem and, consequently, to address  it. Without those adequate records, we are not sure who is running away, why  they are running away, or, indeed, whether a child is repeatedly running away.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There are a number of reasons why young people run away  from care. It may be because of an unsuitable family placement, for example.  There is also the issue of young asylum seekers, who are vulnerable to  exploitation and trafficking.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Improving the lives of children is a priority for the  Health Department. It states that effort needs to be focused on the most  vulnerable and disadvantaged, and no group is more vulnerable or disadvantaged  than children. It is essential that all partners work together: the statutory  agencies, the Police Service, health and social services, and the NIO, because  it still has that responsibility. Indeed, the Manchester Safeguarding Children  Board emphasised that point.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Runaways are on the increase in the UK, and I am led to believe that that may also  be the case in Northern    Ireland. &lsquo;Care Matters in Northern Ireland&rsquo;  outlines the vision to improve services for children in, or on the edge of,  care and to provide support. The Care Matters strategy, which was launched in  2007, planned to improve the outcomes for children who were looked after by the  state. I am pleased to hear that the strategy is with the Executive and is soon  to be implemented, because charities that work with young people, such as  Barnardo&rsquo;s and Save the Children, are advising us of what we know anyway:  children who run away from care homes may turn to sleeping rough, begging,  theft, drugs and alcohol, because they are living on the street and do not have  a lot of choice. That puts them at considerable risk, and we are always picking  up the pieces.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In Northern    Ireland, there are so many children in care  who do not attend school and who have mental-health problems, as well as  alcohol and drug-related problems. There are also many teenage parents and  young offenders. There are many reasons for the barriers to improvement, but I  fear that insufficient joined-up working across all the relevant authorities is  a major one. We now have an opportunity to make a fresh start to tackle the  issue head-on collectively. For too long, children have suffered in a care  system that has failed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">To begin with, there must be clear statistics and  guidelines to deal with the protection of children. In recognising the  seriousness of the issue, the Government must commit to fulfilling their  international obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the  Child and to providing better protection to the most vulnerable children.  Without stability and future prospects, children whom we fail to protect now  may fall prey to homelessness and to a life on the street. It is a huge  challenge for all of us. It is a much wider societal issue, but the Health  Department has the main responsibility, not only because of the ripple effect  of any negative impact on society, but because all children are our future, and  we have a huge responsibility in that area.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I support the motion and the  amendment. I thank the proposer and her colleagues for tabling the motion and I  commend the proposer and Members who brought the amendment to the House.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion is comprehensive. It mentions the monitoring of  figures: quite a bit has been said about the difficulty in obtaining those  figures, what figures are obtainable, and how are they used. The motion then  mentions lack of access to therapeutic support for young people who have gone  missing, perhaps repeatedly. It acknowledges the pressure that is on the PSNI,  asks the Department to behave as a corporate parent and calls for a strategy to  be drawn up to address the reasons why children abscond. The amendment refers  to the sexual exploitation of young people who go missing.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The absence of the Minister of Health, Social Services and  Public Safety for the debate, which was raised by my colleague Sue Ramsey right  away, is an issue. However, Mr Gardiner made the point that the matter could be  dealt with by the Health Committee. The way to address the important issue of  vulnerable children may be found somewhere between those options. However, this  must not be turned into a conflict between Members and parties. Ultimately, I  do not believe that that will happen.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The PSNI&rsquo;s reply to a freedom of information inquiry states  that in January 2009, 16 young people were missing from homes here. That  response gave me a sense of the difficulties involved, a feeling that I also  got from somebody in the Western Health and Social Care Trust. The situation  can be fluid. As my colleague Michelle O&rsquo;Neill said, somebody who is 15 minutes  late in returning to a children&rsquo;s home can be reported as missing because they  did not return on time. The person from the Western Trust told me that a  judgement call is involved in such cases.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Individual absences differ. Someone may present a very  serious problem by being absent from the place in which they should be for two  or three minutes. As a Member said earlier in the debate, anything can happen  in a very short time. However, a young person who goes to school every day and  who is due back at 9.00 pm may have arranged to do something else that leads to  them being 10 or 15 minutes late. The person from the Western Trust said that  it can be difficult to record all those details.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I accept that point, and I note that the proposer of the  motion asked for figures to be recorded and kept centrally. Responses to the  Member for Strangford Miss McIlveen suggest that trusts should have those  figures and that, perhaps, given time, they will be able to produce them.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I share Mrs Hanna&rsquo;s delight that the Care Matters strategy  will be considered by the Executive fairly soon. I hope that that strategy  addresses a number of the issues that have been raised in the debate. Go raibh  maith agat.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Purvis</strong>: I  am glad that the Assembly is taking the time to examine the situation of  vulnerable children and young people in our community. I thank the authors of  the motion and the amendment.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have been working quite a bit on this issue in my  constituency of East Belfast. I have very  serious concerns about what is happening to those children. What we know of  them and the risks to which they are exposed are extremely worrying. However,  what is even more troubling is what we do not know.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In response to a freedom of information request in January  2009, which has already been mentioned, the PSNI stated that 38 children were  classified as missing in Northern    Ireland, 16 of whom were missing from care.  Clearly, the numbers fluctuate regularly. However, if those figures are  typical, they suggest real cause for concern but probably do not herald an  emergency.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">When it comes to trying to understand the situation of  vulnerable children, the problem is what we do not know. The number 38 tells us  very little. We do not know how many children are truly missing from care or  how often they go missing, because there is no regulatory requirement for that  information to be maintained, tracked or reported. The 16 children missing from  care are likely to be the tip of the proverbial iceberg. I welcome the fact  that Barnardo&rsquo;s is carrying out research into that issue, and I urge the  Department to fund more such research.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We know that children in care are not thriving in our  society. Before they enter care, many children will have endured an abusive or  violent situation at home and few will have had any form of stability or  healthy, caring relationships in their young lives. As Miss McIlveen stated  earlier, a mere one in 10 care leavers achieves five or more GCSEs. The  statistics of young people in care are very similar to those from disadvantaged  backgrounds.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Those circumstances leave children and young people in a  very vulnerable position. Many of them carry a host of unmet economic, social  and physical needs that can leave them open to manipulation. We know that care  homes are targeted by criminals who seek to take advantage of children who are  at risk of being coerced into some form of physical, emotional or even sexual exploitation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion rightly calls for specialist support services  and a strategy to address and remove the risks to which those children are  exposed. However, it does not address a lingering and important question about  the other children who are missing. If we return to the PSNI&rsquo;s figure of 38  missing children, half of whom are in care, where is the other half? Who are  they?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Children who go missing from residential and foster care  are one element in a broader concern of missing and vulnerable children. The  issue is very serious and scary and it is happening in our own communities.  Children and young people are being coerced and manipulated into various forms  of exploitation. What do we think of a 13-year-old girl who has a 28-year-old  boyfriend? Is that acceptable or is it child sexual abuse? That is what is  going on currently.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Not all those children are missing. Some of them go home to  a parent who is aware of, and is quite possibly involved in, the exploitation  of their own children. I know of a case of a mother who allowed and encouraged  a relationship between her 14-year-old daughter and a 40-year-old man. Is that  acceptable in our community? I know of examples in which pub and club owners  have prevented community workers from entering their premises to try to  identify vulnerable young women for fear of losing business. That happens on a  weekly basis.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We turn a blind eye to those situations that are clearly  there for us to see almost any weekend in a pub: a 12-, 13- or 14-year-old  girl, dolled up to the nines, goes to the pub, drinks alcopops and gets a  boyfriend of 27 or 28 years of age. He goes with her that weekend, falls out  with her the next weekend and passes her on to one of his friends. That is what  is meant by being passed around the pub. Is that acceptable? Of course not: it  is paedophilia.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Does the Member accept that one of the beneficial outcomes of the Protect Team  model used in Manchester  is that it investigates children who are missing from care and addresses other  vulnerable children in the community? Its scope is much wider than children in  care, so it may help to address the issue that the Member has mentioned.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Purvis</strong>: I  thank the Member for his intervention, and I accept that the model&rsquo;s scope is  much wider than children in care. That is what we need to see.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The alternative is the continual sexual abuse of children.  Those children and young people rarely make an informed choice to be involved  in such activities; they are groomed, manipulated or forced into them.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">5.30 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The answer is to prioritise child protection at all levels.  That means changing our perspective and approach to the issue to reflect the  understanding that the children are victims who have been coerced, or worse,  into those activities and that they are not willing participants. That will  require a joined-up proactive response from all the agencies and organisations  that come into contact with those children. As well as the Departments, the  police, the judiciary, our local councils, and even the licensing authorities,  have an important role to play.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion and the amendment.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Some Members remarked on the Health Minister&rsquo;s absence from the debate. As my  colleague Sam Gardiner said, the Minister&rsquo;s record on answering questions and  on participating in debates ranks well above any other Minister, as does his  record in introducing legislation. Furthermore, he is more active in running  his Department than the majority of DUP Ministers. Mr Weir was so exercised  about the debate, yet he has not managed to remain in the Chamber for its  entirety.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Miss McIlveen opened the debate by laying out some worrying  statistics and trends, and other Members backed her in those arguments. A  common theme running through Members&rsquo; contributions was the dangers faced by  children and the need for the Department to be the corporate parent and to work  with other Departments and Government agencies to address the issues of drugs,  alcohol and sexual abuse.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Another common theme was the need for improved record  keeping. However Mrs McGill said that representatives from the Western Trust  had told her of some of the difficulties faced when trying to keep records.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In moving the amendment, my colleague Mr Beggs provided  frightening statistics on children&rsquo;s services and spoke of the worries in that  regard. I attended a useful briefing from the Department on the Care Matters  strategy at the all-party group on children and young people. Such strategies  are a welcome development, and it is hoped that the Care Matters strategy will  have Executive approval soon.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Beggs and Mrs Hanna mentioned the need for a  cross-governmental approach to children missing from care. It is not the  responsibility only of the Department of Health, but of the NIO, the Youth  Justice Agency, the Department for Employment and Learning and the Department  of Education. A great deal of work needs to be done in addressing the serious  issues that we face.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Ms Ramsey accepted the Ulster Unionist Party&rsquo;s amendment  and said that we need to make serious progress on the issue. Bar some debate  about the Minister&rsquo;s non-attendance at the debate, there was agreement that we  need to do more on this issue, and that is to be welcomed. However, I remind Ms  Ramsey that the difference between attending a debate and attending Question  Time is that one supplies a Minister with the opportunity to provide  ministerial accountability. It has nothing to do with appearing on television,  as Ms Ramsey might have suggested in an intervention.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mrs Bradley spoke about the importance of children in  society, and every Member accepts that. She also spoke about the effort that we  must all make in addressing how our care system looks after those children.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mrs Hanna also mentioned early intervention and early  detection, which must be made a priority in so many areas if we are to prevent  families from reaching the crisis point whereby their children are put into  care. Many Members pointed out that the best home for children is with their  families, so it is critical that we have such support and early-intervention  procedures in place.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">One of the best contributions that I heard today was from  Ms Purvis, who talked about the broader issues and told some horror stories  about the exploitation of young people in our society. It was certainly  shocking to hear them, but it is right that we do, so that we can start to  address the issues. It is just horrendous that that is going on so very close  to this Building.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank Members for their support for our amendment.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  The debate is timely, and I thank my colleague Miss McIlveen for bringing it to  the House. I regret that some Members have criticised her motives for doing so,  but I can assure them that her only motive was to raise in the House concerns  that people had brought to her. It is right that the matter should come before  this House, because it is important.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A number of weeks ago, we debated a motion that had been  tabled by Sinn F&eacute;in Members, and at the time, I pointed out that although the  issue was important, it was unlikely to make many headlines. I dare say that when  we pick up tomorrow&rsquo;s newspapers, the headlines will once again be about MPs&rsquo;  expenses. That is fair enough, but, unfortunately, this debate will not get  much mention in any newspaper because newspapers do not tend to be interested  in these stories. However, they should be, because we are talking about vulnerable  children.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If one asked those vulnerable children whether they wish to  be in care or in family homes, their overwhelming response would be that they  wish to be in caring, loving homes with their own parents. Unfortunately, for  many young children across Northern    Ireland, that is not the case.  Unfortunately, intervention is often required. Many children end up either in  foster care or in care homes not because of any wrongdoing on their part, but  because they have never had an opportunity in life and because their parents  have not provided for them. In some cases, their parents might not have had  opportunities in life either, and the problems affecting those children could  have been passed down through a number of generations.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  The Member mentioned foster care, and this is foster care fortnight. Does he  agree that tremendous work has been, and continues to be, carried out by people  who take it upon themselves to bring those vulnerable children into their own  homes? Indeed, I heard a report this morning about a man and a woman who had  reared their own family and had taken foster children into their home. We  should acknowledge that tremendous work.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  thank Mr McCarthy for that intervention. Mrs O&rsquo;Neill also commended foster  carers on their work, and I can endorse both Members&rsquo; comments. Many foster  carers are the salt of the earth; they are people who want to give some love  and care to children who have had none.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is good to see Mr Weir with us in the Chamber. Indeed,  he has been present for most of the debate, and I welcome the fact that he  continues to be with us &mdash; in spite of Mr McCallister&rsquo;s previous remark about  his absence.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It amazes me that the issues raised today do not appear to  be being taken up by our Children&rsquo;s Commissioner. In the previous Assembly, I  was Chairperson of the Committee of the Centre, on which Mr Beggs and other  Members also sat. Some of the stories that we heard would have raised the hairs  on the back of one&rsquo;s head. We heard about how children were being treated and  how young children were getting caught up in cycles whereby they repeatedly  ended up in juvenile justice centres and care facilities. Those cycles need to  be broken.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to see people in the office of the Northern Ireland  Commissioner for Children and Young People getting their teeth into those  issues. However, I am afraid to say that I have yet to see any evidence of  that. I challenge the Children&rsquo;s Commissioner to support those vulnerable young  people; her office has not inconsiderable resources with which to carry out  those duties.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Miss McIlveen pointed out some important statistics,  including the fact that 53% of young people leave school without any  qualifications and only 12% leave with five GCSEs or more.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Glenmore Children&rsquo;s Home, which does excellent work,  reopened in January 2004. It is a small four-bedded unit with a large enclosed  garden and a ground floor that is suitable for disabled young people and  disabled visitors. Two young people left that home recently. One is 19 years  old and is studying at Queen&rsquo;s University, and the other is her sister, who is  studying at the Lisburn Institute of Further and Higher Education and lives  with her grandparents. Three other young people in that home are studying for  qualifications and are doing very well at school. A 15-year-old came to live in  the home recently and is settling in there very well. Unfortunately, a decision  has been made to close that home. One must ask why it is closing. I suspect  that the decision has more to do with cuts than with anything else. That home  is an example of one that is performing; however, it will not be allowed to do  so because it is to be closed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Neither Roy Beggs nor any Member who supported the  amendment made a case for it. Fortunately, it made its own case, as none of the  Members who spoke in support of it was able to do so. Mr Beggs&rsquo;s attitude was  that the Minister should not be blamed. However, the motion is not about  blaming anybody; it is about highlighting an issue, and I think that Mr Beggs  got off on the wrong foot.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Sue Ramsey criticised the Minister for his inability to  multitask and for letting men down. She said that women could multitask and  that they could handle a crisis and respond to debates. In this instance, I  must say that men have been let down. However, I suspect that other males could  do the Minister&rsquo;s job and multitask a bit better than Mr McGimpsey has done in  this case. Ms Ramsey also said that young people missing from care equated to  their being vulnerable.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Naomi Long talked about self-harm, mental distress, and the  use of police resources in a non-contact environment. She said that a more  coherent strategy should exist.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mervyn Storey tackled the issue of poor record keeping and  said that he believed that there has been a ministerial failure on the issue in  a number of areas in the Department of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety and that it was time for action.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Michelle O&rsquo;Neill commended foster carers, and she called  for a more cross-departmental, cross-statutory strategy to tackle the issue.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Peter Weir said that we needed robust statistics and record  keeping, which are vital in dealing with the matter. He wanted to prevent  children suffering, because when children become involved in these issues they  suffer, and, as a consequence, society suffers with them.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Samuel Gardiner spoke for three minutes and 27 seconds and  addressed neither the motion nor the amendment; he simply had a little rant  about the Minister and the DUP and indicated that one should not ask any  questions of the Minister and that he should be allowed to get on with his job  without having to deal with anything. I assure Mr Gardiner that there will be  more motions on this issue; this is a matter that concerns the people of Northern Ireland.  The DUP will not ignore health issues just because it does not hold the  portfolio of the Department of Health.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Carmel Hanna talked about family support and early  intervention and about establishing the reasons why young people run away. She  said that there were wider societal issues for that, and I tend to agree with  that point.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Dawn Purvis said that 38 children are missing, and of  those, 16 are in care. She said that there is little stability in many young  people&rsquo;s lives. She also provided some startling examples, including that of a  13-year-old girl who has a 28-year-old boyfriend, and a 14-year-old girl who is  with a 40-year-old man. Wider society can only regard that as purely  exploitative and wholly unacceptable, but it is taking place. The challenge to  wider society is the question of what it is going to do stop it. A number of  people must take up that challenge.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">5.45 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">John McCallister once again defended the Minister&rsquo;s record.  The Minister may have responded to questions, but that is not the same as  answering questions. An awful lot of questions, including those on the issue  that we are discussing, are responded to with a statement that the answer is  unavailable in the format requested, and other such nonsense. If we were given  more answers, there would be less need for some of the debates that take place.  Mr McCallister indicated that there is broad agreement that something needs to  be done, and he is absolutely right.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is deeply disappointing that neither the Minister nor  any colleagues or officials that he could have sent were present for the  debate.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Member to draw his remarks to a close.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Nevertheless, the matter has been aired, and the public is now aware of it. In  future, we will be looking for more action and fewer evasive answers.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText"><span class="Italic">Question,</span> That the amendment be  made, <span class="Italic">put and agreed to.</span></p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Main Question, as amended, put and agreed to.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That this Assembly notes with concern the failure of  the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety to monitor and  maintain baseline figures relating to the number of children who go missing  from care and the number of such incidents per child; demands action to address  the lack of access to specialist therapeutic support services for these  children across all Health and Social Care Trust areas; recognises the pressure  on police resources and time in retrieving these children; calls on the  Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety to place greater emphasis  on the needs of missing children and to ensure that his Department accurately  accounts for these children in its role as corporate parent; and provides a  clear strategy and resources to address the reasons for these children going  missing and the risks to which they are exposed during their absence;  furthermore notes the danger of sexual exploitation that children missing from  care can face; notes the successful approach of the Manchester Safeguarding  Children Board &lsquo;Protect Team&rsquo;, and calls on the Northern Ireland Office to  ensure that the Police Service of Northern Ireland, in conjunction with the  Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety and the relevant  voluntary sector organisations, provides an enhanced Protect Team for Northern  Ireland with a view to preventing the sexual exploitation of children and young  people.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Adjourned at 5.46 pm.</p>
