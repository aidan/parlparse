		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The Assembly met at 12.00 noon (Mr Speaker in the  Chair).</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
		    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="1"></a>Assembly Business</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Moutray</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. It has been drawn to my attention that during  a function held in Parliament Buildings on Friday evening, individuals refused  to leave the Building when the fire alarm was sounded. Is the Speaker able to  make a statement to the House on this serious issue today, or will he undertake  to carry out an investigation and report back to the Assembly to ensure that  the situation will not be repeated?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I thank the Member for his point of order. I will look into the situation and  report back to him.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText"><span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; ">At the sitting on  Monday 3 December, Mr Campbell,</span> on a point of order, asked me to  establish when the Department for Social Development was aware that it was  likely that his question to the Minister could not be put on the grounds that  the matter in question had <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt; ">become sub judice  on Friday 30 November. Mr Campbell </span>was concerned that he had not been  informed earlier that his question could not be put.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I can confirm that information showing that leave had been  granted for a judicial review was received from the Department for Social  Development last Monday morning. My officials made enquiries about the grounds  on which leave had been granted. On that basis, I was satisfied that the  grounds for review <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; ">related to matters  referred to in Mr Campbell&rsquo;s question.</span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">At approximately 1.35 pm last Monday, I ruled that the  question could not be put on the grounds that the <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt; ">matter was sub judice. I understand that the Member was</span> informed  soon after that. I cannot say at what time the Department considered the matters raised by the Member.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  Thank you for investigating the case at my request, Mr Speaker. May I take it  that the High Court proceedings that were commenced on the morning of Friday  week ago &mdash; about which we are now having this discussion and about which you  were informed last Monday morning by the Department &mdash; were the reason why my  question was ruled inadmissible? Rather than being informed when it became apparent that my question would be  inadmissible, I was notified a full working day later that my question  would not be included on the Order Paper.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  In response to the Member&rsquo;s point of order,  my office and I were informed only on the morning of Monday 3 December  2007.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On Tuesday 4 December 2007, Mr Raymond McCartney made a  point of order alleging that the word &ldquo;lapdog&rdquo; had been called out when a  colleague had risen to ask a question. Mr McCartney asked me to rule on whether  that was unparliamentary language. I did not hear the remark. However, if it  was made, I do not consider that it was unparliamentary, in the context of  Standing Orders.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As I have said on a number of occasions, I urge Members to  consider the dignity of the Chamber before they indulge in such antics. I have  repeatedly asked Members to be mindful of their language, and I do so again.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  On a further point of order, Mr Speaker. Would the term &ldquo;pet poodle&rdquo; be  acceptable in the Chamber?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order, order.</p>
		    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="2"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
		    <p class="H5StageHeading">North/South Ministerial Council &mdash; Aquaculture and  Marine Sectoral Format</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: I have received notice from the Minister of Agriculture and  Rural Development that she wishes to make a statement on the North/South  Ministerial Council (NSMC) in aquaculture and marine sectoral format.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development (Ms Gildernew)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a  Cheann Comhairle. With your permission, Mr Speaker, I wish to make a statement  in compliance with section 52 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 regarding the  first meeting since restoration of the  North/South Ministerial Council in aquaculture and marine sectoral  format. The meeting was held in the Loughs Agency headquarters at Prehen on  Wednesday 21 November 2007.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive were represented by Ian Paisley Jnr and me;  the Irish Government were represented by Eamon Ryan TD, the Minister for  Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. This statement has been agreed  with Ian Paisley Jnr.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council noted the progress that had made since the last  meeting in April 2002 and welcomed the opportunity to come together to discuss  co-operation in the aquaculture and marine  sector. The Council welcomed the passing of legislation in both  jurisdictions in 2007, which provided the Loughs Agency with the powers to  regulate aquaculture and wild shell fisheries in the Foyle and Carlingford  areas.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council also welcomed the introduction of a hardship package to provide a measure of relief  to those affected by the cessation of commercial drift-net, or  draft-net, salmon fishing in the Foyle area.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council noted the  future plans in the aquaculture and marine sector for 2008-10. Those include  actions to maintain the sustainability of fisheries in the Carlingford and  Foyle catchments; the introduction of a regulatory and licensing regime for  aquaculture in the Foyle and Carlingford areas; the improvement of the angling  licensing system; and the introduction of a marine tourism development  strategy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council also approved the Loughs Agency corporate plan  for 2008-10 and the business plan for 2008, subject to budgetary considerations  by the Executive and the Irish Government. It was noted that the St Andrews  Agreement review is now under way and that the agency&rsquo;s future plans may  require consideration in light of the outcome of that review.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council approved the implementation of the Loughs  Agency&rsquo;s marine tourism development strategy for 2008-13, subject to the  availability of funding under the EU programme for cross-border territorial  co-operation. That strategy will work through partnerships with state  authorities and private bodies, and it will provide support for projects,  develop access infrastructure, project development, skills training, marketing  and communications activities.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council also approved the Loughs Agency&rsquo;s financial  assistance policy to oversee how grant aid will be administered to support  angling development, conservation and protection of fisheries, marine tourism  and aquaculture.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council noted the Loughs Agency&rsquo;s annual report and  financial statements for 2006. The Council approved  the agency&rsquo;s proposed purchase of a monitoring vessel, subject to the  availability of funding under the EU  Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG).</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council approved  the Foyle Area and Carlingford Area (Angling) (Amendment No. 2)  Regulations 2007, which should impact positively on the conservation and  protection of salmon stocks in an area of the River Finn, noting that the regulations will now be progressed in  accordance with legislative procedures in both jurisdictions.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText"><span style="letter-spacing:-.25pt; ">The Council also noted  the regulations being developed</span> to improve the control of salmon and  coarse angling, and for the licensing and development of aquaculture.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council agreed that its next meeting in the aquaculture and marine sectoral format will take  in place in February 2008.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson of the Committee for Agriculture  and Rural Development (Dr W McCrea)</strong>: The Minister indicated the welcome for  the hardship package in respect of the cessation of commercial drift-net salmon  fishing in the Foyle area. What progress has been made with the EU to ensure  that those payments are made before the end of the year?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister state whether a similar package will be  paid to the oyster fishermen of Strangford, who are being forced to close their fisheries? Those fisheries have  been supported in the past by the Department in order to protect the horse  mussel.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  Both sponsoring Departments have submitted state-aid notifications to the  European Commission in respect of the hardship payments. We have been working  with the Commission to expedite its approval. Following receipt of that  approval, the Loughs Agency will be in a position to start processing those  payments. I intend to raise that issue with EU Fisheries Commissioner, Joe Borg, when I visit Brussels this week. Like the Chairman,  I would like to see the payments made before the end of the year.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As for the oyster fisheries in Strangford Lough, I do not  have the relevant information at hand because my statement relates to the work  of the NSMC. However, I am happy to respond in writing on that matter.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her statement. I welcome  the plans for the aquaculture and marine sector for 2008-10, which are  interesting. The Minister&rsquo;s statement mentioned the North/South Ministerial  Council&rsquo;s welcome for the introduction of a hardship package to provide relief  for those affected by the cessation of certain types of salmon fishing in the  Foyle area.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There were two jellyfish attacks on salmon stocks on the County Antrim  coast on 21 and 23 November. Can the Minister provide an update on that  situation and confirm that that matter has been discussed by the Executive?  What financial package will be introduced for those who have been affected?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  I am dealing with the North/South sectoral meeting. The Glenarm situation was  not discussed at that meeting because that matter is outside the Council&rsquo;s  remit. As the Member knows, I have had a number of discussions with Executive  colleagues, and the matter that he has raised was discussed at last week&rsquo;s  Executive meeting. At this point, I do not have any further news for the House  on a financial package. We are still working on that. I am not sure whether  that will be forthcoming.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>: I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. Like the Chairperson of the  Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development, I note the Minister&rsquo;s  reference to the hardship package for those forced from the industry because of  the new regulations. Who was involved in drawing up the guidelines for the  hardship package? Could the Loughs Agency corporate plan for 2008-10 be  tampered with as a result of the review of the St Andrews Agreement?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  As I said in my statement, we shall be examining all those matters under the  review of the St Andrews Agreement. I have already addressed that issue.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The hardship package was discussed by the Foyle,  Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission, the Loughs Agency and officials from  my Department. However, those discussions were very much guided by the Loughs  Agency.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  My question also relates to the hardship package, which is welcome. Why can the  Minister not make similar provision for the Irish Sea  fishermen, such as those in Portavogie, for example, who have been crying out  for such a package for quite some time? That also applies to the fishermen of  Strangford Lough, who have been denied a livelihood.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  Again, that does not come within the remit of my statement. However, the  package is available for the salmon fishermen because it is part of <span style="letter-spacing:.05pt; ">measures to conserve stocks and to protect species</span> from overfishing or exploitation. That does not automatically read across to  other sectors, where the stocks are not the matter of most concern. However, I  am very aware of the pressures that face the fishermen of Portavogie, as the  Member has pointed out. I met those fishermen last week, and I am trying to  explore ways in which we can help them.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her statement, and I thank her and her ministerial  colleagues for the work that they did at the meeting.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council welcomed the legislation that was introduced  this year to give the Loughs Agency powers in relation to aquaculture. Will the  Minister and her counterpart in the South keep the implementation of that  legislation under review, so that new anomalies do not emerge? In relation to  the hardship package, the questions are how much and how soon. Similarly, how  much is envisaged for the proposed tourism develop&shy;ment strategy?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  The hardship package is marginally more than that agreed in the Twenty-six  Counties, due to the nature of fishing in the Foyle. We received approval for  that from the Department of Finance and Personnel (DFP) when I met the Loughs  Agency earlier this year. I welcome the Council&rsquo;s support for the Loughs Agency  and for what it is doing, and I can reassure the Member that I will be keeping  a close eye on all these developments to ensure that they are as helpful to the  agency as can be.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The agency is in the process of applying to the Special EU  Programmes Body (SEUPB) for funding of approximately &pound;13&middot;64 million for the  marine tourism project. SEUPB will only advise the agency of the proposed level  of commitment after a feasibility study has been completed.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>: I thank the Minister for her statement. Does she recall her  meeting, some 6 to 8 weeks ago, with the Strangford Lough Fishermen&rsquo;s  Association? We were looking for hardship money for them as well, and she said  that she would look at the matter. She has said this morning that hardship  money has been made available for conservation reasons. Since sections of Strangford Lough have been boxed off for  conservation purposes, would it not  be fair for the Minister to consider  hardship money for the fishermen of  Strangford Lough?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  As the Member says, we did have a meeting some weeks ago. The issue there was  the environmental protection of the modiolus beds in Strangford Lough and the impact on them of fishing and pleasure boating. When I was in Portavogie,  Ardglass and Kilkeel last week, I announced measures under the European  fisheries fund. We will want to explore how we can spend that money with a view  to helping all the sectors of the industry  &mdash; fishermen, processors and the aquaculture  and inland fisheries people. We will be trying to use the money  imaginatively while keeping within state-aid rules. As the Member knows, there  is quite a bit of controversy over the application of those rules.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">If the Member is suggesting that the remit of the NSMC be  extended to include Strangford, we can certainly consider that and the future  prospects of Strangford Lough.</p>
		    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="3"></a>Executive Committee Business</p>
		    <p class="H5StageHeading">Charities Bill</p>
		    <p class="H4StageHeading">First Stage</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development (Ms Ritchie)</strong>: I beg to introduce the Charities Bill [NIA  9/07], which is a Bill to provide for the establishment and functions of the  Charity Commission for Northern Ireland and the Charity Tribunal for Northern  Ireland; to make provision about the law of charities, including provision  about charitable incorporated organisations; to make further provision about  public charitable collections and other fund-raising carried on in connection  with charities and other institutions; to make provision about the funding of  such institutions; and for connected purposes.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Bill passed First Stage and ordered to be printed.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Bill will be put on the list of future business until a date for its Second  Stage is determined.</p>
		    <p class="H5StageHeading"><a name="4"></a>Pensions Bill</p>
		    <p class="H4StageHeading">Further Consideration Stage</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Further Consideration Stage is intended to enable the Assembly to debate  any last amendments to a Bill. As no amendments to the Pensions Bill have been  tabled, there will be no opportunity today to discuss the Bill. Members will,  of course, be able to have a full debate at the Bill&rsquo;s Final Stage. The Further  Consideration Stage of the Pensions Bill [NIA 7/07] is therefore concluded. The  Bill stands referred to the Speaker.</p>
		    <p class="H5StageHeading"><a name="5"></a>Company and Business Names (Amendment No. 2)  Regulations (Northern Ireland)  2007</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment (Mr Dodds)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">That the Company and Business Names (Amendment No. 2)  Regulations (Northern    Ireland) 2007 (S.R. 2007/462) be approved.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am seeking the  Assembly&rsquo;s approval for regulations to add three further expressions to  the list of those that require the prior  approval of my Department before being included in the title of a  company or business. The Department&rsquo;s prior approval is required if a company  or business seeks to use certain words or expressions as, or as part of, its  company or business name. That control is in place to protect the public from  possible harm arising from a company or business using a name that falsely or  incorrectly suggests a status to which that company or business is not  entitled.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The regulations before the House today add the expressions  &ldquo;HPSS&rdquo;, HSC&rdquo; and &ldquo;NHS&rdquo; to the abbreviations for health and personal social  services, health and social care and National Health Service respectively to  those words and expressions already prescribed. &ldquo;HSC&rdquo; and &ldquo;HPSS&rdquo; have both been  included in the regulations at the request of the Department of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety, while &ldquo;NHS&rdquo; is included at the request of the  Department of Health in Great    Britain. The Assembly approved a similar motion on 2 October 2007 in  respect of regulations that added the word &ldquo;Government&rdquo; to the list of  words already prescribed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My Department made these regulations on 7 November 2007,  and they came into operation the following  day. As laid down in the parent legislation, and to ensure continuing  effect, the regulations are subject to confirmatory procedure, and require  approval by resolution of the Assembly within 10 sitting days or 30 days,  whichever is the longer, of the laying date, 7 November.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of  Health in Great Britain had some concerns that an opportunist could seek  to include &ldquo;NHS&rdquo; in a company or business name and moved to have the expression  added to the list of prescribed words and expressions requiring the written  permission of the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory  Reform in Great Britain before a company or business may trade under a name  that includes any of those words or expressions listed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">While &ldquo;NHS&rdquo; is a well known brand name across the whole of  the United Kingdom &mdash; and I  understand that the Department of Health  has now registered &ldquo;NHS&rdquo; as a trademark &mdash; its cover does not extend to Northern Ireland.  Health provision here is dispensed under the health and social care, formerly  health and personal social services, banner. However, it is necessary to  include the term &ldquo;NHS&rdquo; in regulations made here as a company registration is  recognised across the United    Kingdom, irrespective of the jurisdiction in  which it is incorporated. Similarly, &ldquo;HSC&rdquo; and &ldquo;HPSS&rdquo; have also been included  in the corresponding Great    Britain regulations made on 5 November 2007,  which were debated in the House of Lords and the House of Commons on 20 and 21  November respectively.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Since the Great Britain legislation was made under powers in its Companies Act 1985, which does not  extend to Northern Ireland, my Department was asked to consider the  introduction of similar legislation here under equivalent powers in the  Companies (Northern Ireland) Order 1986. That is to maintain parity in company law with Great Britain, thereby removing any  opportunity to exploit the lack of parallel  legislation here.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">These regulations amend the principal Company and Business  Names Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1984, previously amended in 2004 and 2007,  to add the same expressions &mdash; &ldquo;HSC&rdquo;, &ldquo;HPSS&rdquo; and &ldquo;NHS&rdquo; &mdash; to the list of those  words and expressions requiring the written permission of the Department before  being included in the name or title of a company or business. The departmental committee  considered the regulations at its meeting on 15 November 2007 and recommended  confirmation by the Assembly.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that the motion, which is non-contentious, will be  approved by the Assembly.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson of the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment (Mr Durkan)</strong>:  On behalf of the Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment, I advise the House that the Committee has considered the  amendment to the regulations. It believes that it is necessary and appropriate  to add to the prescribed list of terms in  the company and business names regulations the three terms that the Minister has outlined. Therefore, the Committee fully agrees that it is necessary  and timely for the Department to act  in the manner in which it has.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">That the Company and Business Names (Amendment No.2)  Regulations (Northern    Ireland) 2007 (S.R. 2007/462) be approved.</p>
		    <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="6"></a>Administration of Estates (Rights of Surviving Spouse  or Civil Partner) Order (Northern    Ireland) 2007</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel (Mr P Robinson)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">That the Administration of Estates (Rights of Surviving  Spouse or Civil Partner) Order (Northern    Ireland) 2007 (S.R. 2007/452) be approved.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Like the Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment, I hope &mdash; and expect &mdash; that debate on  the motion will be non-contentious.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The purpose of the Order is to increase the statutory  legacy, which is the sum of money that a surviving spouse receives from the  estate of his or her deceased spouse if that person dies intestate. The  provisions also apply to a surviving civil partner in the same way as to a  surviving spouse. The amount of the statutory legacy that is contained in the  Administration of Estates Act (Northern    Ireland) 1955 is set at two levels. First, a  surviving spouse will be entitled to the  first &pound;125,000 of the estate if the deceased is also survived by his or  her issue &mdash; that is, children and grandchildren. Secondly, if there is no  surviving issue but other relatives of the deceased, such as parents or siblings,  are still alive, the surviving spouse will be entitled to the first &pound;200,000 of  the deceased&rsquo;s estate.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Those figures were set in 1993 and relate to deaths that  occurred on or after 1 January 1994. The Order will increase the amount of the  statutory legacy that is payable from &pound;125,000 to &pound;150,000 for cases in which the intestate is survived only by a spouse, and  from &pound;200,000 to &pound;450,000 where the intestate is survived by a spouse  and other relatives.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The level of the statutory legacy was the subject of a public consultation exercise that ran from  January 2007 to April 2007. However, only four responses were received.  The Committee for Finance and Personnel has  considered and approved the new amounts. Clearly, no formula exists that  will determine, at any given time, the appropriate levels of the statutory  legacy. However, the new amounts follow on  from a review of a full range of social, economic and demographic  factors. I believe, therefore, that they have  been set at an appropriate level for this jurisdiction and that they  will allow reasonable provision for a surviving spouse.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It will be apparent from  my earlier comments that the amounts  of the statutory legacy have remained unchanged for 14 years. In future, I will seek to review those amounts  more regularly to ensure that they keep pace with economic developments. I urge  Members to support the motion, and I propose that the Order be affirmed.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and Personnel (Mr Storey)</strong>: As the  Minister of Finance and Personnel has explained, the Adminis&shy;tration of Estates  (Rights of Surviving Spouse or Civil Partner) Order (Northern Ireland) 2007  increases the amounts that are payable from an intestate.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On 27 June 2007, the Committee for Finance and Personnel received a detailed oral briefing on  the proposed Statutory Rule from the Department of Finance and  Personnel&rsquo;s principal legal officer in the Departmental Solicitor&rsquo;s Office. The  Committee considered some aspects of the Statutory Rule, and it made several  recommendations to the Department. Those included increasing the statutory  legacy figures that are payable from an intestate; seeking views on the new  figures from the respondents to the original consultation; considering any  revised figures for England and Wales; and acknowledging the need for a regular  review of the statutory legacy figures and  the five-year review period.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a case for a  wider review of the intestacy laws, to  ensure that arrangements are in place for an equitable distribution  among all claimants, including children and dependent relatives, and to take  account of societal changes since the legislation was introduced in 1955.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee raised  those issues formally with the Department on 4 July 2007, and received a  substantive written reply on 15 October  2007. The Committee gave further  consideration to the Statutory Rule on 21 Nov&shy;ember 2007, and was  content that the Department had taken on board its recommendations.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee agreed unanimously to support the Department  in seeking the Assembly&rsquo;s endorsement of the  provisions of the Order. On behalf of the Committee, I therefore support  the motion.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I thank the Deputy Chairperson for his comments, and I thank the Committee for  its work regarding the Order. I assume that  the reason that no one else wishes to speak on the matter if that  everyone is satisfied &mdash; just as, having  submitted only four responses, the community is clearly satisfied with  our approach.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The issue is important because, in general, the belief is  that were someone to die, his or her spouse automat&shy;ically takes over the  proceeds of the estate. That is not the case, and this should be a warning to  everyone with considerable assets to prepare a will, and ensure that no one  dies intestate.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister of the Environment has arrived, so I need  filibuster no longer. I encourage colleagues to support the motion. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I must thank the Minister for that.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question, put and agreed to.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;That the Administration of Estates (Rights of Surviving  Spouse or Civil Partner) Order (Northern    Ireland) 2007 (S.R. 2007/452) be approved&rdquo;.</p>
		    <p class="H5StageHeading"><a name="7"></a>Climate Change Bill  [HL]: &nbsp;Legislative Consent Motion</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment (Mrs Foster)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly endorses the principle of the extension of  the provisions of the Climate Change Bill [HL] to Northern Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank my colleague  for filibustering on the adminis&shy;tration of estates &mdash; something that few  of us would take lightly.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We debate the motion  because it is now accepted that climate change is the greatest  environmental challenge faced by the world  today. The matter is being taken very seriously at international level  and, in recent days, we have heard of talks  in Bali to achieve a new post-Kyoto agreement.  The outcome of that conference, and future discussion, may well demand new  international action.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The UK Government, and each of the devolved  administrations, are committed to tackling the issue, because we in Northern Ireland  must play our part. The Climate Change Bill  [HL] is intended to assist the UK&rsquo;s  transition to a low-carbon economy. The Bill will make the UK the first economy to set a  long-term legal frame&shy;work for reducing emissions. There are no specific  devolved provisions in the Bill, as the attainment of targets will require action in both reserved and devolved-policy  areas.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The key provisions of  the Bill are: a series of statutory targets for reducing carbon dioxide  emissions; a new system of legally binding five-year carbon budgets; a new  statutory body, to be known as the committee on climate change, to provide  independent expert advice and guidance; new powers to enable the Government  more easily to implement emissions-reducing policies; a new, open and transparent system of annual reporting; and a  requirement for a risk assessment of the impact of climate change, including a  commitment to develop a programme to prepare for those impacts.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have had good support for my position from the Executive and from the Committee for the  Environment. Moreover, I am pleased to say that the Environment  Committee supports the motion for legislative consent. However, scrutiny by the  Committee has raised several issues in relation to the composition of the  committee on climate change. Those were, specifically, the establishment of a Northern Ireland subcommittee, and the need for a member of the climate change  committee to be from Northern    Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I understand the intentions of Committee for the  Environment members, who are concerned that the special and specific needs of Northern Ireland  may not be recognised and taken into account. I have assured the Committee that  provisions that are now in place provide for devolved Administrations&rsquo; specific  needs. Members of the committee on climate change will be appointed jointly by the other relevant devolved  Ministers and me, and the committee will have knowledge and experience of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s circumstances.  More&shy;&shy;over, criteria that instruct  the committee on climate change must  take into account Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s circumstances, and there  must be a direct reporting line from the committee to me. I have also assured  the Committee for the Environment that I  will follow good practice and review the issue of a Northern Ireland  subcommittee once we have evidence of assistance received.</p>
		    <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Molloy] in the Chair)</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for the Environment asked that a Northern    Ireland member be appointed to the committee on climate change. However, this is not to be a represent&shy;ative  committee but one made up of experts in relevant fields. I can tell the House that no similar representations for an equivalent arrangement have been made in  either Scotland or Wales.  Therefore, it is not necessary that we have a Northern Ireland representative on  the committee on climate change. Good arrangements have been made for the  appointments process, for the criteria for operating the committee on climate  change and for its reporting lines. Those  arrangements reassure me that the committee will provide Northern Ireland  with all relevant advice. I am committing significant resources &mdash; around  &pound;100,000 per annum &mdash; to the running of the committee. Therefore, I want to  ensure that we get value for money through  the advice provided.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for the Environment agrees that, at this  stage, we should support UK  targets rather than provide for Northern    Ireland targets. I have given the Executive  a commitment to return to the issue once I am more certain about the Northern Ireland  emissions baseline and when I am better  informed on the relationship between economic competitiveness and  greenhouse-gas-emission reductions. Current research into those matters is  progressing well, and I anticipate receiving the findings of that research by  March or April 2008.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill will amend the  Energy Act 2004 by enabling the Secretary of State to set up a renewable  transport fuel obligations (RTFO) scheme,  which the Department for Transport  plans to introduce from April 2008. I have agreed to inform the House on  that matter on behalf of the Department of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment. The RTFO  scheme will be the main mechanism for supporting the increased use of  biofuels in transport across the UK. The 2004 Act, which provides  the framework for the RTFO scheme, already extends UK-wide. That was agreed  while the Northern Ireland Assembly was suspended and has considerable merit,  despite the fact that energy is a transferred matter. For example, the  transport-fuel industry operates almost seamlessly UK-wide, and the proposed  structure of the RTFO scheme is such that it will impact on the large GB-based  suppliers that import fuel and refine oil rather than on our local suppliers.  Furthermore, it is planned that the  obligation will be applied alongside the road-fuel excise duty and the  associated biofuel rebate, both of which are reserved matters.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department for Transport&rsquo;s work to date to develop the  detail of the RTFO scheme has identified a number of administrative areas in  which change from the original concept, as  outlined in the 2004 Act, would be preferable. Appropriate amending  provisions have been included in the Climate Change Bill [HL] and must now be included in this legislative consent  motion in order to enable Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  continued involve&shy;ment in the  UK-wide RTFO scheme. Those amendments will allow the Secretary of State  or Department for Transport agencies to be the RTFO scheme&rsquo;s adminis&shy;trators;  will provide for the proceeds from buyout payments to be paid into the  Consolidated Fund rather than be redistributed among suppliers; will establish  an information gateway between the RTFO administrator and HM Revenue and  Customs; and will provide an overarching  duty on the RTFO administrator to encourage the supply of sustainable  biofuels.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">None of those proposed legislative amendments nor the  existing primary provisions specifically apply to Northern Ireland &mdash; they all apply  UK-wide. From an operational perspective, the Department for Transport does not  consider that any local transport-fuel supplier will be obligated under the RTFO scheme. Furthermore, the  Department for Transport does not believe that there will be any appreciable  impact on pump prices.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have highlighted the significance of the Climate Change Bill [HL], including those provisions that  relate to the RTFO scheme. The House&rsquo;s endorsement of the principle that  the Bill be extended to Northern    Ireland would  demonstrate that we are fully committed to playing our part in tackling  the very serious global issue of climate change. I commend the motion to the  House.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for the Environment (Mr McGlone)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a  LeasCheann Comhairle. On behalf of the Committee for the Environment, I thank  the Minister for tabling the legislative consent motion to extend the  provisions of the Climate Change Bill [HL] to Northern Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee recognises the threat from climate change and  is aware of the urgency of the problem. It is  against that background that the Committee considered the extension of  the Bill&rsquo;s provisions. It was briefed in writing  on the issue on 28 June 2007 and by the Minister in Committee on 5 July  2007. The Committee learned that the Bill provides a framework for moving to a  low-carbon economy. Indeed, the Minister has outlined some of the Bill&rsquo;s key  provisions in the debate: a series of key statutory targets for reducing carbon  dioxide emissions, including an overall UK target of 60% reduction by 2050,  with a 26% to 32% reduction by 2020; a new system of legally binding five-year  carbon budgets that are set at least 15 years in advance; a new statutory body, called the committee on climate  change, that will provide  independent expert advice and guidance to Government on achieving their  targets and staying inside their carbon budgets; and new powers to enable the  Government to more easily implement emission-reducing policies.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill also contains accountability provisions that  require progress reports. In early September 2007, the Committee provided a written response on the extension of the  Bill&rsquo;s provisions. The Committee supported the UK  carbon-reduction targets that are set out in the Bill but sought a commitment  to provide Northern Ireland  targets in the future. The Minister  subsequently advised the Committee by letter on 15 November 2007 that  she will revisit the issue of Northern    Ireland targets after further examination of the emissions baseline.  Research into the emissions baseline is currently ongoing.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On the matter of representation on the independent  committee on climate change, to which the Minister has referred, the Committee for the Environment initially held  the view that the committee should have specific representation on it from the  North, and that there should be an independent subcommittee structure in Northern Ireland  for the independent climate change committee. However, during recent meetings,  the Committee considered the issue of representation against the size of the  proposed overall committee and the need for  it to have specific expertise. We also sought the views of our  counterpart Committees in Wales  and Scotland  in order to inform our point of view. The Committee for the Environment now  acknowledges that the Bill currently provides for members to be appointed to  the committee on climate change jointly by the national or regional authorities  and notes that the proposed committee may set up its own various subcommittees.  Therefore, we no longer seek the specific representation that the Minister  outlined.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for the Environment takes the view that the  independent committee on climate change should provide independent advice to  the Northern Ireland Executive. It is acknowledged that the Bill states that  the committee must give, on request, advice, analysis or information on  targets, budgets, trading schemes or other  requirements that relate to greenhouse-gas emissions. The Committee  supports the Bill&rsquo;s enabling powers, which it views as helpful, subject to Northern Ireland  consent, for the introduction of other climate change initiatives. The Bill  provides for Northern    Ireland to set up, if required, its own  trading schemes. The Committee can foresee climate-change-mitigation  initiatives in the North that would use those enabling provisions. The  Committee also supports the proposed reporting arrangements.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">During its deliberations, the Committee for the Environment  expressed an interest in examining the idea of setting up a separate local body  on climate change that could harness local knowledge on the issue and through which views could be formed and  expressed. The Committee will revisit that matter. Information is  currently being sought on whether other similar initiatives exist. My Committee  colleague Mr Ford may address that matter in more detail. However, I raise the  issue because the Committee discussed it recently due to its relevance to the  broader issue of dealing with climate change. I conclude that the Committee is content  in principle for Westminster  to legislate in the area concerned and will support the motion. Go raibh maith  agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  welcome the motion and congratulate the Minister of the Environment on moving  so quickly on the issue. It was important that the Committee received the  extensive briefing that it got from the Minister and her officials.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It was also important that there was a real sense of engagement on the issue so that, although the  Committee was unified on the broad purpose of the Bill, concerns about  the detail were dealt with appropriately. That has steered us in the right  direction.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">12.45 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As regards climate change, we are often told to think  globally and act locally. The motion allows the Northern Ireland community to make a vital contribution  towards meeting national targets and towards ending the international problem  that is climate change. It will put us into a regulatory framework at a  national level, which is appropriate, but it will also allow us a degree of  flexibility to develop our own initiatives. It has been said that there has  been a problem with monitoring the Northern   Ireland baseline figure, and we are glad to hear that  there is ongoing work to establish Northern Ireland&rsquo;s position. That  will help us to frame further initiatives on climate change at a later stage.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that the Assembly sends out a clear message  to people that no contribution is too small. Whether contributions are made at  Assembly level, Government Department level,  or by businesses, insti&shy;tutions and individuals, we all have a part to  play in helping to achieve the targets that  are vital for the future.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Although the work of the  Minister and the Department in ensuring that Northern Ireland has an input to  the Bill is welcome, it would have been preferable to have had someone from  here on the carbon committee that will be dealing with the matter on a UK-wide  basis. However, we must be realistic when it comes to a committee that is  likely to comprise eight or nine members. Whether it will happen remains open  to question. However, ongoing work on co-ordinating efforts between the  devolved institutions across the UK will play a vital role.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department has put provisions in place to ensure that Northern Ireland&rsquo;s input is direct and that the  committee will hear a clear voice from Northern Ireland &mdash; that is  something that should be welcomed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I also welcome the fact that we can proceed on the basis of  the existing structures, and that the possibility of a review has been left open. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s  commitment that, in three years time, there will be a review of how the system  is actually operating and whether there may  be, for example, a need for a Northern<span style="letter-spacing:0pt; "> Ireland</span> subcommittee. That can only come about when we are much more secure in our knowledge of Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s baseline data. However, that the option is being kept open is welcome.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, I welcome that the Minister and the Depart&shy;ment, in taking action, have been able to  meet the Committee of the  Environment&rsquo;s concerns. It is a positive step forward, so early in the  lifetime of the Assembly&rsquo;s current mandate.  Reducing carbon levels is an Executive commitment, as outlined in the  draft Programme for Government. I welcome the steps that have been taken and I  urge everyone to support the motion.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I welcome the  fact that the Minister is taking firm measures to reduce CO2 emissions here.  The matter needs to be addressed urgently, as recent reports, such as the  &lsquo;Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Intergovernmental  Panel on Climate Change: Fourth Assessment  Report&rsquo; have outlined. Both reports have spelt out, in the clearest  terms possible, the consequences that  climate change is having already, and the potentially disastrous effects  to come. It is also worth noting that the scientific community is united in its  acknowledgement of those dangers.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The leading economist,  Nicholas Stern, has endorsed the need for a 50% cut in emissions,  globally. That requires the more developed world to put in place an 80%  reduction in emissions, especially in places such as Ireland and across the water.  Therefore, it is quite clear that there will be dire economic consequences if  climate change is not taken seriously, something which Mr Stern makes clear in  his report.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Although Sinn F&eacute;in  believes that a target of reducing CO2 emissions by 60% by 2050 is a  step in the right direction, we support following the example of the Scottish  Government that have set legally binding targets to reduce the 1990 levels of  emissions by 80% by 2050.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Ireland,  of course, has huge potential to generate electricity from wind and wave power,  as well as from biomass technologies, and we should not be reluctant to set  higher targets in the Climate Change Bill [HL].</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in also believes that all-Ireland legislation should  be introduced to ensure that there is consistency across the entire island. The  levels of carbon emissions North and South are closely linked through the  single electricity market and the proposed single gas market, as well as  through other fields. Many areas in the world have already been affected by the  increase in average global temperatures, and the latest scientific evidence  suggests that the next five years will be absolutely crucial if further  irreversible damage is to be avoided. Even  the European Union&rsquo;s agreed long-term goal of limiting global warming to  no more than 2&ordm;C above the temperature in  pre-industrial times might not be  sufficient to avoid the significant negative effects of climate change.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, I welcome the fact that the Minister has  brought this matter to the House so soon after restoration of the Assembly. The  provisions of the Climate Change Bill [HL] are a step in the right direction,  but Sinn F&eacute;&iacute;n would like further changes to be made, and the party believes  that a review early in the new year would provide the opportunity to make those  changes. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burnside</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement, and I support the motion.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In her opening remarks, the Minister referred to the international obligations that are again under  discussion in the post-Kyoto conference at Bali.  Will she agree that the challenges of climate change and reducing carbon  emissions worldwide are such that whatever we in  the United Kingdom and the  developed industrialised world do to  tackle the problems, unless the United States  and the massive economies such as India  and China  are included in those efforts, it will amount to nothing?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, although I support the motion, I ask the Minister if she will, on behalf of the devolved  Adminis&shy;tration, bring pressure to bear on the United Kingdom Government to adopt a much wider international  frame&shy;work that incorporates China  and India  and does not exclude them for the foreseeable future.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: As  a member of the Committee for the Environment, and on behalf of my group, I  welcome the proposal that the Minister has brought to the House today. It is  absolutely right &mdash; and there is unanimity in the House on this &mdash; that we should  be full participants in the UK  climate change process. However, I have some slight concerns that by being  involved with the UK  structures, there is a danger that focus may be lost &mdash; particularly as this proposal comes from the Environ&shy;ment Minister  rather than the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We have already heard  that, quite reasonably, because of the size of the committee on climate  change, which will cover the whole of the UK,  it is unlikely that there will be specific Northern Ireland  representation. How&shy;ever, we know &mdash; and it has been acknowledged on all  sides of the House &mdash; that climate change is probably the major challenge that  we face in the world today. This matter has global implications.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Although I hear what Mr Burnside has said about the  developing economies of the Far East, at this stage, carbon production per  capita in China and India is far  lower than it is in the North and in the West. We must be realistic; we are the  people who have the lead to give. The Assembly has taken considerable interest  in international development, yet it is a blunt fact that carbon is created in  the north and the bulk of the problems are caused in the south. We have a moral  obligation to provide the lead on this matter.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I ask the Minister to give an assurance that when we play  our part in the UK-wide process, she will ensure that the Executive take global  warming and carbon production extremely seriously. She has already talked about  getting the baseline report next spring, and that is to be welcomed. However,  we know from a UK-wide report that was published last week by an NGO, and which  was broken down by local authority, that Northern Ireland has the worst  environmental record in many areas. That is largely because of the fuels that  we use for domestic heating and the fact that we are excessively reliant on  private cars. We have a great deal to accomplish, and I trust that the Minister  will ensure that the Executive continue to take note of today&rsquo;s debate even  when other pressures are on them.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to follow up on a point that was made by the Chairperson of the Committee for the Environment,  Patsy McGlone, who referred to advice that the Committee sought from Wales and Scotland. In particular, I draw the Minister&rsquo;s attention to the fact that, like  us, Wales is covered by the UK Bill  and has no specific representation on the committee on climate change,  yet the Minister for Environment, Sustainability and Housing in the National  Assembly for Wales has established a Climate Change Commission for Wales, which  I understand will meet for the first time this morning.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">That commission has been designed to involve the National  Assembly for Wales,  local government, and the business and voluntary sectors, and it will have a  link to the Sustainable Development Commission Wales. By working on a voluntary  basis alongside the UK  committee, it will be able to maintain a focus on Welsh needs.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Rather than waiting three years for a review, I ask the  Minister to establish an informal voluntary local structure that would enable a  more specific focus to be directed to Northern Ireland and that would  ensure that we continue to meet our obligations. That would be useful to Northern Ireland, and it would not cost a great  deal more than the UK  process &mdash; &pound;100,000 &mdash; to which she has committed. I thank the Minister and her  officials for the work that they have already done, and I hope that she will  consider my proposal as a way forward for the future.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  Today we are addressing the most important issue that faces us in the century  ahead: climate change as a result of global warming. That is an important  issue, not just for those who live on these islands, but for people everywhere  in the world. We should all know from our own experience that even in winter,  we have less snowfall and heavier rainfall than we had 20 years ago. For those  who have not yet experienced those changes, scientific opinion supports the  facts. For example, since the 1970s, the average temperature in these islands  has increased by 1&deg;C. Several Members have  said that if that increase continues unchecked, there will be more  catastrophes, such as floods and droughts, and infectious diseases that result  from those will spread. It is therefore important to extend the Climate Change  Bill [HL] to Northern    Ireland, to set targets for the reduction of  carbon emissions and to keep rising temperatures in check.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Findings always emerge from scientific study, not least the  latest, which warns that over the next 50 years we must keep the temperature  rise in check and below the critical figure of a 2% increase. Many people are  of the view that a 60% reduction in carbon emissions, which is the aim of the  Bill, is not enough. As another Member said earlier, that is perhaps a modest  target, and we should aim to achieve an 80% reduction. In light of that, will  the Minister tell the House what capacity is in the Bill for reviews to take  place, lest we find out in 20 years that the 60% target was far too modest a  reduction in carbon emissions? Will it be possible to aim for a greater  reduction, and even to achieve a reduction of 80%?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I also seek clarification on an issue that has arisen  previously when the Assembly has considered UK legislation. During the debate  on the draft Renewables Obligation (Amendment) Order (Northern Ireland)  2007 on 15 October 2007, I raised the matter of the single energy market. Given  that local suppliers of renewable energy sources are unable to obtain credits  for feeding their products into the Republic   of Ireland, I discussed  how oddly that Order fitted against the reality of the new single energy  market, which came into being on 1 November  2007. The same disadvantage affects suppliers in the Republic of Ireland  who wish to trade in this direction. If we consider that the Bill is concerned  with energy production and the use of carbon, how will it fit against the  background of an all-Ireland single energy market?</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">1.00 pm</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  I also welcome the motion. It is particularly appropriate that the motion should  be introduced during the UN climate change conference in Bali.  I regret that the Assembly is not represented there. The only Northern Ireland  delegate is my Green Party colleague Peter Doran, who is making some input into  that important decision. It also follows last Saturday&rsquo;s global day of action,  held at St Anne&rsquo;s Cathedral, which highlighted the growing concern of people in  Northern Ireland.  We must listen to such legitimate demands for us to show leadership, and I  therefore welcome the <span style="font-size:11.0pt; ">small  step that has been indicated by the proposal to extend the provisions of the  Climate Change Bill [HL] </span>to Northern Ireland. The Green Party  suggests that the Assembly should develop and implement its own climate change  Bill.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The UK Climate Change Bill [HL] aims to reduce the net carbon account by at least 60% by 2050.  Although we welcome that reduction, it is clear from the reports of the  intergovernmental panel on climate change  that that figure is not adequate to  prevent global temperatures  from rising above dangerous levels. Therefore, we welcome the fact that the Government have emphasised that that  is only the minimum level of reduction to be considered. Equally worrying is  that the Bill proposes that some of the CO2 reductions may be accounted for by  the purchase of foreign carbon credits. The buying of such carbon indulgences must be kept to a minimum.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Climate Change Bill  [HL] consultation document recognises:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the role of the Devolved Administrations in relation  to setting, modification and achievement of the UK targets and the intervening  carbon budgets&rdquo;.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">More  significantly, it allows the devolved Administrations flexibility:</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText"><span style="font-size:8.5pt; ">&ldquo;The Bill will be amended to take account of these decisions before  introduction to the UK Parliament.&rdquo;</span><span style="font-size:8.5pt; "> </span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The Scottish Executive have expressed their  intention to introduce a Scottish climate change Bill, which is due to set a  long-term target to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 80% by 2050. That target  is 20% higher than the target proposed in the UK Bill and amounts to reductions  of 3% each year. The Irish Government are also  committed to reducing the amount of CO2 emissions by 3% each year. In  both Scotland and the Republic of Ireland, the main reason for the more  stringent CO2 targets is the input from the Green Party. If the more  scientifically informed reduction of 3% per annum is good enough for our  neighbours in Scotland and the Republic, and since there is explicit provision  for the Assembly to devise its own  legislation on climate change, I ask the House to devise climate change  legislation that commits Northern Ireland to making cuts of at least 3% per  annum in CO2 output.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  Carbon dioxide output is determined by a lot of factors, not least changes in  the climate and weather from one year to another. For example, a particularly  cold winter might lead to more coal or oil being burned or more electricity  being consumed. Can the Member explain how such year-on-year targets would  work? There will be peaks and troughs, and the targets would become either  meaningless or a rod to beat people with over an event that was beyond their  control.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  I thank the Member for his question. Given the weather conditions that the  Member refers to, there will be changes in the levels of emissions. However,  the targets would be assessed over a number of years. A target of 3% a year  would equate to 15% over five years. One year the emissions might be 3%,  another year 5% and another year 1%, but, over a period of time, the average  would be 3% per annum.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly should make that its target and, there&shy;fore, I  support the motion.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson of the Committee for Enterprise, Trade  and Investment (Mr Durkan)</strong>: I  place on record that the Committee  for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment was consulted on the legislative consent motion and  received a written briefing and  presentation by officials. The Committee supports the legislative  consent motion and recognises that, as the Climate Change Bill [HL] is taken through Westminster,  it is important that it clearly encompasses the situation in Northern Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee has a direct interest in energy policy and  recognises that, as the Bill goes through, players in the energy sector here  will probably raise different angles and  issues. Through the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment and  the Minister of the Environ&shy;ment, the Committee hopes to be able to factor in  such considerations as the Bill proceeds. Climate change must be a major  consideration that will programme and frame  our energy policy, and we view the legislative consent motion as one  part of that. However, we recog&shy;nise, as other Members have expressed, that  that will not be enough, and additional  measures must be intro&shy;duced. We must reflect on what people in the  energy sector &mdash; both existing players and those who enter the sector with new  and innovative ideas on renewable energy &mdash; have to say.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Although the Committee did not come to a formal conclusion,  members had some sympathy with the view of the Committee for the Environment,  and we too wanted to ensure that particular guarantees about the quality of  consideration be given to Northern    Ireland. I  note that the Minister expressed her intent to supplement the structures  to which the Bill commits Northern    Ireland with further consideration.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The single electricity market is one of the issues that  Committee members identified as requiring much consideration, and some Members  mentioned that too. We can learn from the experience of the UK legislation on the renewables obligation: it  set the framework for Northern    Ireland in a way that was blind to the  single electricity market. In an area as important as climate change, we simply  cannot afford legislation that informs and affects how the energy market will  operate, but that is blind to the single electricity market in Northern Ireland.  If Members are to be considered coherent legislators, we must ensure a proper  recon&shy;ciliation between the two. If the two do not properly rhyme, we cannot  back one and not back the other.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  am pleased to follow the Chairperson of the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment. At one  stage, I feared that the debate was becoming a closed shop for members of the Environment Committee, despite the fact that the implications of the  legislation cut across all  Government actions and all sectors of society.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Several Members have expressed their concern that the  target of a 60% reduction in carbon emissions is not sufficient. I appreciate that we are debating the UK Bill today  and that 60% is the target that it sets. However, it seems that many of our  devolved partners are more ambitious and have recognised the need to go beyond 60% by considering a figure of 80%. There is  widespread concern among domestic  and international non-govern&shy;mental organisations (NGOs) that the UK is not  aiming for an 80% reduction. As someone who firmly intends to be around in  2050, I hope that &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  You are fairly round now.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>A Member</strong>:  Now, now; it is Christmas.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  understand that the Member for Foyle was busy being Santa at the weekend. I too  dressed up as Santa over the weekend, and it is all part of the act.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  You are a better Santa than he is.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  hope that I have better presents.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Anyway, with hindsight, there are genuine concerns that we  may have made a mistake in not aiming for a more ambitious target of 80%. I  hope that we &mdash; as a country, not just as an Assembly &mdash; do not live to regret  not opting for that target.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to focus on what we are doing to address climate change in the draft Programme for  Government and the draft Budget and on the interaction between the  environment and our economy.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  If Northern Ireland were to achieve an 80% reduction in carbon emissions by  2050, what percentage of electricity would have been generated in that time by,  for example, windmills or tidal power? Is there even the capacity to achieve  that target through the use of renewable  forms of energy, or does the Member support many people&rsquo;s position,  which is that we will have to go nuclear?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  will deal with that point in more detail presently, but it is fair to say that  we must invest in a wide range of alternative ways in which to generate  electricity and energy. It is important that we keep an open mind.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Two conclusions are part and parcel of the Stern Report.  First, the implications for our economy will be huge if we do not protect the  environment and address climate change. Those consequences are becoming very  real.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, genuine economic opportunities exist for us to  invest in climate change technology and for our economy to reorient itself in  order to become greener. In some respects, that may answer Sammy Wilson&rsquo;s  question. Although many forms of renewable energy may not be cost-effective at  present, as time moves on and we invest in  more efficient technology, that balance will change. In this part of Western Europe, we must capitalise  on the opportunities that arise from our natural environment &mdash; namely, the wind and sea &mdash; and invest in them.  Solar power will not become one of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s main  attractions.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have concerns about whether the final Programme for  Government will make a major contribution to the climate change agenda. I was disappointed that, despite the  strong economic focus in the draft Programme for Government and the draft  Budget, the green economy was not referred to; Northern Ireland needs to have a  green economy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In some respects, we are a developing economy, so there is  a natural desire to invest in our infrastructure in order to bring our economy  up to speed with that of many of our competitors. However, in doing so, it is  critical that we bear environmental concerns in mind and that we do not allow  ourselves to get trapped into the notion that a contradiction exists between  economic growth and protecting the environment. As a society, we must make a  choice. In fact, the two issues go hand in hand.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Transport particularly concerns me. My colleague Mr Ford  referred to the Energy Saving Trust&rsquo;s report, which  highlighted that certain local authorities in Northern Ireland have some of the largest carbon footprints in the whole of the UK. Although there may be  differences in the methodology of our baseline studies, that report  indicates a number of problems, not least a heavy reliance on private transport  compared with elsewhere on these islands.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The draft investment strategy for Northern Ireland states  that, in the first three years, around 60% of the transport budget will be  invested in private transport &mdash; that is, on roads &mdash; and only around 40% in  public transport. That is almost the opposite of the situation in Great Britain.  However, over the 10-year period of the investment  strategy, we are to invest 80% of the transport budget in private  transport and only 20% in public transport. That sounds like a  twentieth-century solution to our transport problems rather than a  twenty-first-century solution. In welcoming the motion, we must be realistic about what this society needs to do in order  to get up to speed. We must set not only a 60%  target but an 80% target; it is very much needed.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">1.15 pm</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment (Mrs Foster)</strong>: I thank Members for their positive  contributions to the debate. Some good and serious points were made on the  legislative consent motion.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McGlone spoke as the  Chairperson of the Environ&shy;ment Committee; I thank him and all the  Members of the Committee for their constructive approach to the legislation. As  I did, the Committee wanted to send out the message that it aimed to tackle the  problem of climate change, which it achieved through its positive engagement  with me and my officials.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McGlone was correct to highlight the fact that there are  enabling powers in the Bill. At the request of Northern   Ireland and Wales, the Bill places a duty on me  and the Welsh Minister for Environment, Sustain&shy;ability and Housing, Jane  Davidson, to report on action and adapt to climate change, which we will do.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Peter Weir, who is a Member of the Environment Committee,  spoke about the broad purpose of the Bill and placed on record his thanks to  officials for working with the Environment  Committee. I too place my thanks on record. He acknowledged the  international context and the contribution that this part of the kingdom will  make in efforts to reach the national targets.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As was mentioned during  the debate, the Department has a lot of work to do on Northern Ireland  baselines. I hope that that information will be available in April 2008 so that  we can decide how to move forward. For example, many Members have mentioned  establishing a subcommittee on climate change. When the baselines are  available, we will decide the best way forward. Mr Ford is correct to say that  we do not have to wait for three years, but  can instead objectively look at the figures when they are available next  year.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The important factor  will be the lines of accountability and communication between the  Department and a climate change subcommittee. There will be a two-way discussion because the Department will seek  expert advice on how to adapt to future climate change and deal with  some of the issues to which Dr Farry referred in respect of how to meet our  targets.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McKay spoke of the need to deal with CO2 emissions and  referred &mdash; as did other Members &mdash; to the  Stern Report and the acknowledgement that, if climate change is not dealt with now, there will be &ldquo;dire  economic consequences.&rdquo; That should be borne in mind because although  many people think that combating climate change will cost the Government a lot  of money, if it is not dealt with now, there will be a greater cost in the  future.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>: The Minister is correct to say that there will be a lot of  costs involved in combating climate change,  including increased building costs and increased fuel costs for  individuals in Northern    Ireland. Does the Minister appreciate that  many people find those costs difficult to  accept when those who preach about climate change &mdash; and the harmful  effect of CO2 emissions &mdash; have descended on Bali in the past week and created  more CO2 emissions than Chad does in a year?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Some environmental groups have sent between 40 and 50  members to that idyllic location. I doubt that the same numbers would have attended had the location been Birmingham, instead of Bali.  Can the Minister understand why some people might be a little cynical about  that exercise?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>: I hope that the Member is not suggesting that politicians do  not generate hot air from time to time, because there is a lot of it in the  Chamber. I also hope that he appreciates that I made the sacrifice of not going to Bali.  We are well represented at the conference in Bali by three Government Ministers: the Secretary of State  for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and two other Ministers are  representing the UK  case.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McKay, Mr Gallagher and Mr Brian Wilson &mdash; among others &mdash;  raised the issue of targets. It is important  to recognise that, since the Royal Com&shy;mission&rsquo;s report in 2000, science  has developed considerably. That is why the Bill has been amended so that, for  the first review of the 2050 target, the  committee on climate change will be  able to take into account all developments in scientific knowledge since  the Royal Commission reported in June 2000.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The committee on  climate change will decide whether the  target for reducing carbon dioxide emissions should be increased to the 80% level that Scotland has  decided to go with, and I have  spoken to the sustainable develop&shy;ment commissioner about that. The  committee will look at the scientific evidence and decide, and I think that it  is the right body to make that decision.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Burnside also mentioned the talks in Bali.  It seems that a lot of the politicians in the Chamber today wish that they were in Bali,  but we are here and dealing with the issue of climate change. He said  that the US  has a huge impact on carbon emissions. Mr Ford responded to that when he said  that most of the impact from carbon dioxide emissions is caused by one half of  the world but felt most severely by the other half. The Assembly should  consider that when thinking about the Climate Change Bill [HL].</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Ford also spoke of his worry about Northern Ireland&rsquo;s focus if we were involved in  the UK  climate change committee but did not have our own. I listened carefully to his  comments on what the Welsh are doing about climate change, and I am willing to  look at that. I will look at the Welsh example, but I want to be sure of our  figures. I will look at it again in April when we have those figures. I know  that Mr Ford will be after me in April to see what I am planning to do.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Gallagher spoke about the implications of not dealing with climate change. I agree with him:  adaptation is an important issue with which the Assembly must deal. He  also spoke about the all-Ireland single energy market. I will speak to him  about that when I have spoken to my colleague the Minister of Enterprise, Trade  and Investment about the issues he raised. I am sure that there is a problem of  harmonisation in relation to HM Revenue and Customs, but I will refer the issue  to the appropriate Minister.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Sammy Wilson regretted my absence from the talks in Bali. I hope that he did not mean that he would have  preferred I was there rather than in the Chamber progressing the Bill. I am  sure that that is not the case. He mentioned Scotland&rsquo;s climate change targets;  I hope that I have answered that question. Mr Durkan, Chairperson of the  Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment, spoke about the many issues around climate change and its  impact in the field of renewable energy. He also mentioned the all-Ireland  single energy market, and &mdash; as I said to Mr Gallagher &mdash; I will speak to the  Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment  about that, but I imagine that the difficulties are related to fiscal  policies.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Dr Farry mentioned the target for reducing carbon dioxide  emissions, and I hope that I have addressed that.  He also mentioned the interaction between climate change and the draft  Programme for Government, and the need to  invest in a wider range of renewable energy. Dr Farry will be aware that  my Department recently put PPS 18 out for consultation. He is right to state  that the Stern Report recognised the  economic consequences of not doing anything  about climate change. However, there are now economic opportunities for Northern Ireland, particularly  with our history in engineering and innovative skills. I hope that we rise to  the challenge &mdash; especially with regard to tidal and wind energy, because there  are not many openings for solar energy here.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The environment is at the heart of the draft Budget and the  draft Programme for Government. I have been saying  exactly what Dr Farry said: a better environment and a better economy  are not mutually exclusive &mdash; the two can sit easily together. We have had a  good debate. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly endorses the principle of the extension of  the provisions of the Climate Change Bill [HL] to Northern Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="H4StageHeading"><span style="text-transform:uppercase; "><a name="8"></a>Committee  Business</span></p>
		    <p class="H4StageHeading">Student Fees (Amounts) (Amendment) Regulations (Northern Ireland)  2007: &nbsp;Prayer of Annulment</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Employment and Learning (Ms S Ramsey)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">That the Student Fees (Amounts) (Amendment) Regulations (Northern Ireland)  2007 (S.R. 2007/442) be annulled.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. This  statutory rule is made under the powers conferred by articles 4(8) and 14(4) of  the Higher Education Order 2005.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">That Order capped fees at &pound;3,000, subject only to  inflationary increases. The effect of the statutory rule is the application of  an annual inflationary increase to the basic and higher fees that are charged  by our higher education institutions for qualifying courses in the academic year 2008-09. The statutory rule will  increase the higher amount from  &pound;3,070 to &pound;3,145, and the basic rate will increase from &pound;1,225 to  &pound;1,255. Other rates for other specific prescribed courses will increase on a  pro rata basis at around 2&middot;5%.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Under article 4 of the Higher Education (Northern Ireland)  Order 2005, increases to basic and higher fee rates are subject to rises linked  to inflation until 2010.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I know, go raibh maith agat, that this is a basic point,  but I remind Members that this motion is to annul proposed fee increases.  However, it does not address the principle of variable student fees. Should the  statutory rule be annulled, the current higher rate fee of &pound;3,070 will be  payable by students next year, and other fees will remain at their present  levels.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Student Fees (Amounts) (Amendment) Regulations (Northern Ireland)  2007 were laid in the Assembly Business Office on 5 November. The Committee  considered the statutory rule at its meeting on 21 November, and officials from  the Department were present to explain the position. At that meeting, I  forwarded a proposal that a prayer of annulment be brought to the Floor of the  Assembly. It is important to note that there was Division in the Committee,  with six members agreeing to the annulment motion, and three members against.  During this debate, when I refer to members, I mean those who voted in favour  of proposing the motion.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Members expressed a  number of serious and specific concerns on the statutory rule during the  Committee&rsquo;s deliberations, and I will highlight those.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">First, and more importantly, the Department stated that it  proposed to conduct a review of student finance, including fees, some time  during the academic year 2008-09. The review has been presented as a reason why  fee increases should go ahead, in line with the primary legislation, in advance  of the research and review findings being made available.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, the opposing argument is surely stronger. How can  fee increases be justified in advance of knowing precisely what impact they  will have on take-up or drop-out rates on prospective, or existing, university  students? There is a particularly serious concern  that those most disadvantaged in our community are being put off by  fees, particularly when they see increases coming forward in the absence of due  consideration of their impact. Even before the research and review was decided  on, there was evidence of a drop in the numbers applying to universities after  fees were introduced in 2006. Members of the Committee agreed that the need for  research and review was paramount, and I ask the Department to bring that work  programme forward at the earliest opportunity.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, to increase fees on an annual basis in an  information vacuum is surely taking us down a path from which it will become  increasingly difficult to retreat. Should the research show major impacts on  particular categories of the population, in particular those from disadvantaged  backgrounds, radical action would be required. Continuing on a path of  increasing fees will make reform difficult.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A number of Members and I are concerned about the impact of  fee increases on a particular section of the community. The Committee was  informed that a full equality impact assessment would have been completed with  respect to the primary legislation, and that  no adverse impact was assessed at  that time. The Committee was therefore told that there was no need for a  full assessment of the statutory rule.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Although I accept that that approach may be procedurally  correct, I am surprised that no form of &mdash; at least interim &mdash; equality impact  assessment has been conducted. Student fees are an extremely important issue in  our society, with major financial implications for students.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The lack of further work on the equality impact is linked to the general lack of information that I  mentioned earlier. There should not be any increase in the current level of fees until the appropriate information is  available.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">1.30 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee&rsquo;s briefing on the statutory rule coincided  with a briefing on the draft Budget. Some Committee  members, including myself, found it some&shy;what ironic that, during the  Budget briefing, officials said that the  Department did not have the money to fund changes to maintenance grant  provisions that would provide parity with the position in England and  benefit local students. The Committee was told that, in the absence of such  funding being made available locally, a university student in England whose parents  had a combined income of less that &pound;25,000 would receive &pound;2,835, while a  student here in similar circumstances would receive only &pound;1,877. I mention that  because this statutory rule is seeking parity with England. In this case, parity means  that students will be penalised with fee increases &mdash; yet they will not reap the  benefits of an increase in maintenance funds, since that form of parity cannot,  we are told, be funded. That is clearly a lose-lose situation for local  students.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department made the point that the equivalent Statutory  Instrument in England &mdash; The Student Fees (Amounts) (England) (Amendment)  Regulations 2006 &mdash; has been passed and that students from here who choose to  study in England will be penalised, as they will be paying a higher fee than if  they had chosen to stay and study at our two universities. Committee members opposing this statutory rule did not  necessarily accept that, and the point was made that it could be easily  addressed in appropriate legislation &mdash; for example, by amending the primary  legislation under which those fee increases are made.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The point was made in the Committee that the proposed  review of student finance, including fees &mdash; which I referred to earlier &mdash; might  result in the lifting of the cap on variable fees, thereby allowing the  universities to charge whatever they wish. At present, however, there is no way  of knowing the outcome of that review. Therefore, I propose that the statutory  rule be annulled in advance of a full review of student finance &mdash; both fees and  maintenance &mdash; so that any further detriment to the position of prospective and  existing students can be avoided. I remind the House that on 21 November 2000  it backed a report from the Committee for Higher and Further Education,  Training and Employment &mdash; as it was then &mdash; calling for tuition fees and  means-tested grants to be abolished. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>: I  rise to speak against the motion as a private Member, not as the Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Employment and Learning.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">When this motion was  brought before the Committee, I believed strongly that the best way  forward, in the interests of both the universities and the students, was to  await the impending review of the whole matter. Unfortunately, some members of  the Committee chose to pre-empt the review, and so we are in this position  today.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Much valid concern was voiced by local universities when  the Committee decided to table the motion for debate in the House. By proposing  to annul rises in line with inflation for the next three years, those parties  in favour of such a proposal are engaging in headline-grabbing opportunism  without thinking through the consequences of their actions.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is necessary to review some facts and figures in order  to put the issue into perspective. The regulations, as they stand, provide for  an inflationary increase in tuition fees with effect from 1 September 2008.  Such an increase would see the fees of undergraduates rise from &pound;3,070 to  &pound;3,145. When a rational approach is taken, it is clear that the rise is  relatively small. The amount of the increase will not be the deciding factor  between someone choosing to go to university and someone choosing not to go. To  believe seriously such an argument is to fail to engage in reality.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Although the increase in fees for an individual may be &pound;75,  it is imperative, in the context of this debate, to consider the financial  impact that that would have on local  universities. Should the Assembly choose to annul the 2008-09 increase,  the combined loss to Queen&rsquo;s University and the University of Ulster,  over those three years, will be &pound;7 million. Furthermore, recurrent income for  the universities would be reduced by that total until 2011-12.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Consider the impact of that income reduction on  universities. The funding available to our two univer&shy;sities would fall  significantly behind that available to other UK universities. On such a tight  settlement, our attempts to help those universities to match other UK  universities&rsquo; funding, to attract the best academics, and to encourage research  will be greatly inhibited, and, inevitably, students will suffer.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">All parties signed up to the draft Programme for  Government, which places the economy at the heart of driving Northern Ireland  forward. Cutting university funding would jeopardise the competitiveness of the  top-class teaching and research that the universities provide in support of the Northern Ireland economy. Any  reduction in the standards of university courses here would increase, rather than solve, the brain-drain problem.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Only two weeks ago, we  witnessed the First Minister&rsquo;s and  the deputy First Minister&rsquo;s attendance at the opening of the new cancer research centre in Queen&rsquo;s  University &mdash; a truly world-class facility at the cutting edge of  research. If university finances are cut, such ventures may be in jeopardy. We  should work with universities to ensure  that such projects are possible, and that Northern Ireland can be at the forefront, as it is in cancer  research and care.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Under the current  student-fees regime, 30% of students from a household with an income of  less than &pound;17,501 are entitled to the maximum Government maintenance grant, as  well as to a university bursary. There is a sliding  scale of assistance for students from households with incomes of up to  &pound;32,501. Fees are not the basis on which the disadvantaged are deterred from  entering third-level education. The  increased number of university applicants clearly shows that young  people realise the huge academic, financial  and cultural value of a third-level education.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The DUP is not in favour  of any measures that would increase  the burden on students. In line with fees increa&shy;sing with inflation, we  envisage proposals for maint&shy;enance grants to rise in line with inflation.  Therefore, the burden on students will not rise.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The DUP is in favour of a top-class education system that  encourages our young people to stay in Northern Ireland and go on to  support our economic prosperity. I implore Members to reject the motion, to set  aside headline-grabbing opportunism, and to await the outcome of the impending  review before engaging in debate on the whole issue. I oppose the motion.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  The Ulster Unionist Party asks that Members reject the prayer of annulment.  However, the Chairperson of the Committee for Employment and Learning and Mr  Spratt raised several issues on which there is some agreement, and it is worth  investigating and discussing the right way forward.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">First, there is clear  evidence that students with higher qualifications  earn more, have better job satisfaction, live longer and healthier lives, and contribute more to society.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Is it any wonder that Governments around the world try to  encourage more and more people to achieve third-level qualifications. However,  it is surprising that some people reject  that premise. Perhaps they are worried about the distant promise of  future potential as against an immediate pay  packet, which is much more attractive to young people despite the fact  that it may not be the best long-term solution for them.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">People must be forgiven  for thinking that way, because, regrettably, recent news has shown that  some of our major employers, such as  Seagate, are having difficulties competing in the global economy. Young  people will ask themselves why they should invest in gaining skills when there  is no certainty that those skills will be relevant in the future. Why should  they take on debt when there is no guarantee that they will get a job that will  get them out of that debt?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We are all keen to encourage people from socially deprived  areas into further and higher education, but the accepted wisdom in such areas  argues against taking risks. Strong communal ties encourage people to stay in  the areas that they know. Yet that limits the opportunities  that are open to young people and reduces their horizons, and that is  not what we want.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly must  examine ways to encourage people in those areas to take up further and  higher education. It must discover what must be done to empower them and  release their potential; it must examine what will enable them to succeed where  earlier generations have failed. If we are to increase participation rates,  many people will be the first in their families to have entered higher  education. The real challenge for the Assembly is to confront lack of ambition  and find ways to break the cycle of deprivation and enable all the people of Northern Ireland  to unlock their potential. The answers should come from the Assembly.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">People have come up with various ideas; and the recent trip  to the USA,  which focused on the economy, was most  successful. However, improving our economy will not be sufficient to  solve our problems, because we have relatively low unemployment, and we must  work out how to increase productivity. Unless we can find more people, those  that we do have will have to earn more or work longer. Personally, I favour the  option of earning more.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">No doubt others would argue that equality is the  fundamental challenge facing the Assembly. However, speaking with considerable  experience of international commercial activity, the world is not fair,  equitable or equal; it is a competition, and we must ensure that all our young people have the skills and abilities to  compete in that world.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The only enduring, competitive edge is having a good education. That is why the process is  fundamental to us. The Ulster  Unionist Party is committed to ensuring the increased participation of  all of our people in all stages of education, but particularly in further and  higher education.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairperson of the Committee for Employment and  Learning alluded to evidence that some potential students from areas of social  disadvantage might be put off going to college by debt. The trouble is that we  do not have all the evidence yet. Top-up fees were introduced only one year  ago, and their impact is by no means certain. As I understand from the current  figures &mdash; and, no doubt, the Minister will clarify this &mdash; it is not possible to  see a trend at this stage.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Nevertheless, there is a genuine concern. That is why my  colleague on the Committee for Employment and  Learning, David McClarty, voted with other members to try to find a way  of not passing on fee increases. He did it with the best of intentions in the  hope that the resources could be made up elsewhere. Sadly, that does not seem  to be the case. If the prayer of annulment is passed, universities will lose  &pound;2&middot;5 million this year.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In the proposed tight  CSR (comprehensive spending review) settlement, that will impact significantly on our universities. It is by no  means certain that it will have any particular benefit for the students whom we are trying to help. Therefore, there is  definitely a loss and no particular  gain. The sum of money that has been  referred to represents only a modest increase, in line with inflationary  pressures. As my colleague Mr Spratt has mentioned, that will be offset by  other measures.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">1.45 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The most fundamental problem with the proposal &mdash; which  smacks of tokenism &mdash; is that it is untargeted and  will not address the issues that ought to be addressed. Student fees  represent only a fraction of what it costs to deliver courses. Many students&rsquo;  earning power will be increased as a result  of going on to further education. The  type of uplift to which I am referring is approximately 80%, or &pound;13,000  per annum. Therefore, there is a real economic reason as to why individuals  should pay the fees and go on to higher education.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Those fees help our  universities to compete in a modern world &mdash; and they must compete. The  Chairperson of the Committee for Employment  and Learning has spoken about parity. However, there is an anomaly in  that; even if the Assembly accepts this prayer of annulment, the fees paid by  students from Northern Ireland  who go to universities in Great    Britain will increase, but our ability to give them support will not increase.  Therefore, that will lead to a lack of parity between two sets of  students, which surely is unhelpful.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Many of the issues that have been raised are linked, which indicates that some form of integrated  fundamental review of the process is required. That is exactly what the  Minister has suggested should happen.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We are blessed to live  in a land of outstanding natural beauty. However, we lack natural  resources. The only natural resource that we have is human capital, which is  what will enable Northern    Ireland and its people to compete in the world. If our people are going to  compete, it will be on the basis of knowledge-based industries.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Our universities are our global brands and our champions, and they will take the lead in  enabling people to compete. Now is  not the time to remove their resources or those of students; now is the  time to invest. If the Assembly does not reject this prayer of annulment, money that is badly needed by students and  universities will be taken away.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have made a conscious effort to try to address issues  that Members have raised. All Members want to move in the right direction.  However, this hotchpotch, chancing-one&rsquo;s-arm approach is not the right way to  proceed. A fundamental review of fees, higher education and further education  is required, and that is what is going to happen. Therefore, I urge all Members  to reject the prayer of annulment.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  As Mr Spratt and Mr McCrea have outlined in their contributions, our further  and higher education colleges will have to be at the heart of the economic and wider development of this part of Ireland.  All Members should agree with that.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As Mr Spratt said, the  economy has to be at the heart of  driving this part of the world forward. Unfortunately, the draft Budget  does not reflect that. Although DETI (Department of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment) was the clear winner in the Budget stakes, it is clear that our  further and higher education colleges are the also-rans.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I would take seriously what Mr Spratt said, had he also  stated that the Department for Employment and Learning should receive more  money in the final Budget than it had been allocated in the draft Budget, to  ensure that Queen&rsquo;s University, the University of UIster, the Open University and  the FE (furthur education) colleges are at the heart of the economy. The draft  Budget does not send out that message. It states that there will be 300 more  PhDs by 2011, yet there is not 1p in the draft Budget to fund those PhDs.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Irish Government have offered the Assembly &pound;34 million of their money to enable Queen&rsquo;s  University and the University of  Ulster to participate in an all-Ireland science foundation, yet there is  no money in the draft Budget for that.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I could demonstrate my  point in other ways. Regard&shy;less of  the motion, there should be agreement throughout the Chamber that if the Department of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment is to be the driver of the economy, the Department for Employment and Learning, and FE and HE (higher  education) colleges, must be its partners. That is not reflected in the draft  Budget.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Regardless of the loss that might be incurred by Queen&rsquo;s  University and the University of Ulster if the prayer of annulment is agreed  to, it is not as significant as the funds that FE and HE colleges need from  this year&rsquo;s Budget to ensure that they are at the heart of the economy,  producing the PhDs and the innovation that will be the engine of growth and  opportunity for all our people.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not wish to detract from the universities&rsquo; need for  proper funding, but why is that not demonstrated in the draft Budget? Why is  the Minister of Finance not funding the  initiatives that have been taken by the Minister for Employment and  Learning to put development at the heart of the North&rsquo;s economy?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to deal with some arguments that have been advanced  in respect of the motion. I thought that we could have a debate that would be  free from more exaggerated terms. However, Basil McCrea used the term  &ldquo;tokenism&rdquo; and Mr Spratt referred to &ldquo;headline-grabbing opportunism&rdquo;. This is a  more substantive debate than such terms suggest.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I accept and understand  that if the annulment motion is passed, there will be a loss of funds to  universities in the North. I have said to Queen&rsquo;s University that it should fund that loss from its reserves, so that  universities in the North send out the message to the students, pupils  and parents that those institutions acknowledge that student debt and loans are  a major concern.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Queen&rsquo;s University will  avail itself of any opportunity to increase student fees when the cap is  removed, or even before that. The universities, and Queen&rsquo;s University in  particular, should send out a message to students and their parents that they  understand the problem and accept that, for  a period of time, there will be a shortfall in their budgets. In that  way, those institutions will indicate their best intentions with respect to  student funding. I am concerned that one  university in the North intends, over  time, to try to increase its fees to a premium. I say that because  Queen&rsquo;s University has joined an elite school of universities, known as the  Russell Group. It follows that it will try to increase fees.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is another reason why it is important that the  Student Fees (Amounts) (Amendment) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2007 be annulled.  It is said that there is no evidence as to how access to universities for  students from disadvantaged backgrounds is being affected. If that were the  case, why has the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills (DIUS) in  England &mdash; the sister Department of the  Department for Employment and Learning &mdash; announced major reforms to  student funding, even though fees have just been introduced?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, despite fees having been introduced recently,  that Department has already recognised that there is a need to respond to the  perception, and to the reality that people who wish to go to university may be put in a disadvantageous position. DIUS has  announced higher income thresholds  in order to increase the number of  students eligible for maintenance grants; a repayment holiday for up to five years after graduation for  students in receipt of loans; and the introduction of HE student-support  guarantees for students who are in receipt of an educational maintenance allowance.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">To be fair to the Minister, he is aware of all that, is  examining it and is working through the potential consequences. However, even  though fees have only recently been introduced, DIUS is already taking remedial  action, because evidence of a problem has already come to light. In that  context, it would be fair for the House to annul regulations that introduce  fees, because to do so would be to send out a message to our students and their  parents &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I will give way in a moment, Sammy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The message that would be sent out would be that Members  are concerned and will be seen to respond. Yes, we should be seen to respond in  much more fundamental ways, and for that reason I welcome the review, which the  Minister says will be initiated in the next academic year.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, at the present time in the development of our  education system, for the Assembly to pray against the regulations would be a strong and appropriate symbol to  project to our students and their parents of how Members see the future of  student finance.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  I took the opportunity to look at the Member&rsquo;s contribution on the subject when  student tuition fees were introduced in the Assembly in November 2000 by his  SDLP colleague the then Minister of Higher and Further Education, Training and  Employment, Dr Se&aacute;n Farren. Interestingly, the Member was arguing back then  that the abolition of not only the increase but of student fees entirely would  not necessarily help the disadvantaged. Indeed, he said of a Sinn F&eacute;in Member  in that debate:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;However, he ignored the evidence from the Republic of Ireland on the abolition of tuition fees  and the fact that access is still being denied to under-represented groups&rdquo;. &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official  Report, Bound Volume 7, p263, col 1]</span></span>.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, if, in 2000, the abolition of student fees would  not help, and was not perceived as a way in which to help disadvantaged  individuals, why does the Member now claim that to do away with the increase  would help disadvantaged groups?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I thank the Member for his point and for reminding me of what I said, which is  consistent with what I am saying today, for the following good reason: when it comes to guaranteeing access to  third-level education, a menu of  options must be put in place in order  to ensure that students &mdash; those from disadvantaged backgrounds in particular &mdash; are able to avail  themselves of educational opportunities. One size does not fit all: a  number of options must be available in order to ensure that a person whose  family has had no member go on to higher or further education receives every  encouragement to do so. It is a matter of ensuring that the fees do not exist,  or are set at a smaller level; that grants are set at a higher level; and that  childcare facilities are available for those  who require them. When it comes to guaranteeing access for disadvantaged  people, there must be a menu of options, which is the same point that I made in  November 2000.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In any case, the evidence from England is that intervention is  necessary to mitigate the impact of student fees, so surely we should also  realise that we should intervene to mitigate their impact. That will come in  part through the Minister&rsquo;s review, but we can take other measures now, such as  stopping the student-fee increase on the basis of inflation, in order to send out a strong, clear message to students and their  parents.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I shall now return to  the Chairperson of the Committee for Education&rsquo;s comments. Those  students from here who study in England,  where the fees have already been introduced, face a problem. It is not beyond  the wit of the Assembly draftsmen to draft regulations to assist those students  who would be disadvantaged otherwise, while at the same time advantaging our  own students by not increasing the fees in  line with inflation.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My final point is this &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  No. I have given way already.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">This issue nearly brought down a Government. When the Bill  that introduced student fees was going through Parliament, it came down to a  handful of votes. For that reason alone, it is not opportunism to state that we  should annul fee increases. This issue runs so deep and has such an impact on  people&rsquo;s decisions about going into higher education that &mdash; on its own merits,  never mind the wider context that I have outlined &mdash; the Assembly should vote to  annul fee increases as outlined in the motion.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: The  Alliance Party supports the prayer of annulment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In the past, there has been all-party support in the  Assembly for the abolition of university tuition fees. I note, in particular, the DUP&rsquo;s past support for  that goal.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: No.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Tuition fees are not a product of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  political system; they are a product of New Labour&rsquo;s bankrupt social policies,  one of the hallmarks of which has been to be more Thatcherite than Thatcher  herself would have ever dared to be. We should also remember that tuition fees  have trebled in the past few years, and we are in danger of moving to the  American model whereby universities are for the rich, and where social mobility  is frozen.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Northern Ireland  has been vastly more successful than England in ensuring that young  people from low-income backgrounds go to university. Given that context in  particular, we must develop a Northern    Ireland solution that reflects our unique  circumstances. We should look towards the Scottish system for a working model.  That system expects those who have benefited financially from higher education  to make a contribution to society and  future generations of students after they graduate. That system does not  encumber students with upfront debt, and would free those who have received  higher education but who choose to go into poorly-paid but socially worthwhile  occupations such as social work, the clergy and the voluntary sector from  carrying debt for the span of their adult life.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate the  argument that universities should not be  penalised for the sins of the Westminster Government, or indeed for  those of our own Minister of Finance and Personnel.  I appreciate that the draft Budget has already set a very tough first  year for universities in the next spending  round. However, no injustice can be corrected by its continuance. If we  agree with the principle that tuition fees are unjust &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way, and I note what she said about all-party  consensus. Would she accept that tuition fees were introduced by a party that  is now going to support the prayer of annulment? Over the past number of years,  the percentage of people from all classes in Northern Ireland going into higher  education has increased. Where is the injustice?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: Many  students emerge from university with debts of between &pound;12,000 and &pound;20,000. That  is very worrying for many low-income and middle-income families. The Member&rsquo;s view would certainly discourage that  section of society from attending university.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">If we agree with the principle that tuition fees are unjust,  no Northern Irish students should have to pay them. It is not logical to add to  the burden of a system that we have committed to abolish.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As Basil McCrea said, Northern Ireland has no significant  mineral resources. Our most significant natural resource is the skills base of  our people. In a world where global  competition is ever more cut-throat, we must have the best-educated  workforce possible. In that context, the perpetuation of a system that puts off  some of our brightest young people, simply because they come from a poor  family, is a false economy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">At the risk of sounding like a broken record, I believe  that, if the costs of segregation were tackled, the resource constraints that  face the higher education sector could be addressed. If the draft financial  settlement for universities is poor, the solution to the problem lies with the  Executive and the Minister of Finance and  Personnel. Students should not be penalised for the failures of our  political leaders.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>:  Student fees are a serious issue that should be examined when we are in  possession of all the facts, figures and costings. It is interesting that the  motion on the prayer of annulment was proposed to the Committee for Employment  and Learning before all those facts and figures were available.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Members from all parties asked questions of the Department  for Employment and Learning about how many young people were now applying to  university compared with the number before the introduction of student fees. Members asked how many people dropped  out of university because of financial problems and also about the specific  costs of freezing tuition fees. Many of those questions were not answered. The Department either did not have the information  available or stated that it was far too early to answer some of the  questions. Most of the available information stated that, in recent years,  university admissions were on the rise. In the Chairperson&rsquo;s opening remarks,  she used the phrase &ldquo;should the research  show&rdquo;. That demonstrates the fact that the motion is not based on fact  or research.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Many elements of DEL&rsquo;s budget bid are not being funded, yet  Sinn F&eacute;in, the Ulster Unionist Party, the SDLP and the Alliance Party &mdash; the  parties that supported the motion in Committee &mdash; wish to create an additional  shortfall of some &pound;2&middot;5 million. The DUP is not advocating an increase in  student fees per se. However, this statutory rule would allow student fees to  rise at the same level as inflation and in parallel with student maintenance  grants, which are rising at the same rate. It concerns financial  responsibility. The DUP believes that an increase in tuition fees would not  create additional barriers that would prevent young people from lower-income  families from going to university. As my colleague Sammy Wilson said, there is  evidence that more young people from lower-income families in Northern Ireland go to university than elsewhere  in the United Kingdom.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It would be interesting to know what cuts those parties  that wish to freeze tuition fees will make to other areas of the DEL budget. Sinn F&eacute;in opposes this statutory rule because the rule might  be perceived as support for student  fees, which the party in fact wishes to abolish. Sinn F&eacute;in has not  explained from where it would find the &pound;2&middot;5 million shortfall if fees were to  be capped let alone the &pound;90 million to &pound;100 million shortfall if student fees  were abolished.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Questions about the financial impact of decisions in this  area are not new. My colleague Sammy Wilson referred to Mr Farren&rsquo;s actions in  2000. In November 2000, the then Minister  of Higher and Further Education, Training and Employment, Se&aacute;n Farren,  tried to stop a motion &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Newton</strong>:  Is it not the case that the SDLP introduced tuition fees? Is its position today  not one of political hypocrisy and budgetary irresponsibility?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>:  That is correct. The SDLP did introduce tuition fees.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In November 2000, the then Minister of Higher and Further  Education, Training and Employment, Se&aacute;n Farren, stopped a motion because it  left a number of questions about cost unanswered. Today&rsquo;s motion is supported  by the SDLP, but those issues of cost are still left unanswered.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  Given that the Member has done his research on Se&aacute;n Farren and his statement to  the House in November 2000, will he note that the point that the current  Minister for Employment and Learning makes about  anomalies was also made by the former Minister?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Attwood said that the parliamentary draftsmen must be able to find some legal way around the  problem. However, the former SDLP Minister Dr Farren found that there  was no such way around the anomaly, and he concluded that if his proposals were  not accepted, the result would be disadvantage to &mdash; and discrimination against  &mdash; those who wished to study outside Northern Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I  thank the Member for his intervention. Of course, as always on such matters, he  is absolutely correct.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>: I  succeeded Se&aacute;n Farren as Minister for Employment and Learning. Our  student-support package was built around raising the thresholds at which  students and their families pay fees. We are keenly aware that middle-income  families often suffer most: people just above the benefits threshold. Our policy was to continually raise those thresholds.  Indeed, our policy was supported by NUS (National Union of Students) and  USI (Union of Students in Ireland)  as the best student-support package in these islands.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I  thank the Member for her intervention. It seems as though the SDLP policy has  changed ever so slightly over the years, depending on what positions it holds.  However, at least the SDLP has changed its policy over a number of years; the  Ulster Unionist Party, on the other hand, changed its policy in a matter of  weeks. Only a fortnight ago, the Ulster Unionist representative on the  Committee for Employment and Learning supported the annulment, yet today we  heard Basil McCrea argue against it. There seems to have been a change of  opinion by the UUP in only a matter of weeks, whereas the DUP Committee members  have taken a financially responsible view,  which we maintain today. That is a consistent theme of the DUP in the  Administration: we are financially responsible in all areas of government.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee had the Minister before it only a few weeks  ago. He confirmed during that meeting that a review of the entire area of student finance was is to take place that would  include consideration of fees and grants. That, of course, is to be  welcomed. We should all be patient and wait to see the findings of that review  before we make any decisions that would result in a tighter squeeze on the  departmental budget. I listened to Mr Attwood argue that there was not enough  money in the DEL  budget, and that we needed more for this, that, and the other. However, he then  went on to say that we should create a further shortfall in that budget by  supporting the motion. That seems hypocritical.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">If the motion were passed, universities would lose a  substantial amount of funding, which is used to ensure that the quality of  courses is at the right standard, that the range of available courses is at the  right level, and that there is adequate  funding for research and develop&shy;ment. My colleague Mr Spratt mentioned  the cancer centre in Belfast, which is widely recognised as a  centre of excellence. Such developments come, in part, from our  universities, and that shows the important role that our universities play.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The draft Programme for Government places a strong emphasis  on the economy; indeed, it has the economy at its heart. Considering the size  of Northern Ireland,  our two campus universities play a vital role in that economy. Northern Ireland cannot afford to see our  universities fall behind others in Scotland,  England and Wales in respect of funding. I  congratulate Queen&rsquo;s University on joining the Russell Group. Rather  than viewing that as a bad thing, I contend that that is a very good thing.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We must realise that the barriers that prevent young people  from going to university are not all financial &mdash; there are social issues that  prevent young people from going to university, and, of course, many simply do not achieve the necessary grades. There is a  problem of underachievement in  working-class areas, particularly unionist areas, and that must be  addressed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I listened to the  Alliance Member Anna Lo talk about not wanting a system for the rich.  That is somewhat bizarre, considering the fact that her party supports an  education system that will lead to just that. Rather than academically gifted  children from working-class areas being  able to go to grammar schools, the Alliance Party supports a system that  would see only those who can afford houses close to the good schools gaining  places at grammar schools. That is a little bit of hypocrisy on the part of the  Alliance party.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Ms Lo also mentioned the cost of segregation. That <span style="letter-spacing:-.25pt; ">is another point on which the Alliance Party is  hypocritical</span> because it supports the setting up of Irish-medium schools,  which cost a substantial amount of money, and cater for only one section of the  community.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, I do not support the motion &mdash; I do <span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; ">not see how it can be funded within the current  depart&shy;mental</span> budget, and I do not wish to see other DEL initiatives going unfunded in order to  make up the shortfall. None of us wants to see students in financial hardship,  or barriers put in place to prevent people from learning. However, we should  act responsibly and <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; ">work within the  resources available to us. I look forward</span> to the launch of the review  next year, and hope that Members will wait until then, rather than acting  irresponsibly now to create another financial shortfall in the DEL budget.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Butler</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Ba mhaith liom taca&iacute;ocht a  thabhairt don r&uacute;n i dtaca le t&aacute;ill&iacute; m&uacute;inte. Nuair a bh&iacute; an t-&aacute;bhar seo os  coinne an Choiste labhair m&eacute; ina choinnne.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am disappointed that some parties that gave a commitment  a couple of years ago to oppose tuition fees have now done a U-turn. This  debate concerns the fundamental issue of how  we fund the further-education sector. Creating  a well-educated workforce is all about creating a good student  experience, but we do not have that at the moment. Some parties on the Benches  opposite are making excuses about why universities should be able to charge  tuition fees. In the past year, we have seen students incurring far more debt  than ever before. There is an agenda to  bring the marketplace to universities. There  is talk about some universities in Britain wanting to increase  tuition fees by as much as &pound;10,000. There is division between vice-chancellors,  particularly in England,  over whether tuition fees are the right option. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt; ">Mr S Wilson</span></strong>: Obviously, in an ideal world, we would want university  education to be free at the point of use. However, we must live within  budgetary constraints. With what policy would the Member fill the gap that would be left if tuition fees were not charged in  Northern<span style="letter-spacing:0pt; "> Ireland</span>? What impact would that have on the many  disadvantaged people who gain university places through bursaries and other  forms of help with tuition fees? The universities would not be able to pay for  those if the fee income were not available.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Butler</strong>:  Well, first of all, we do not know the impact of tuition fees. We can say that  there should be a rise because of inflation, yet the Minister &mdash; and I have  written to him several times &mdash; does not know what the impact on disadvantaged  groups would be. He does not even know whether there is going to be an increase  in variable tuition fees. Queen&rsquo;s University and the University of Ulster  could raise those fees. If we do not know that, why are some parties advocating  the defeat of this motion?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am concerned about the proposed review. Will it be  independent? Will students have an input? I hope &mdash; after listening to Basil  McCrea, for example &mdash; that this matter is  not going to be manipulated in such a way as to show that tuition fees  can be justified. I have real concerns about how we can have a totally  independent review of tuition fees. If the review is entirely indepen&shy;dent, and if it shows that tuition fees  discourage people, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds,  will the Assembly abolish them? We must examine those issues.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Tuition fees bring the marketplace to universities. Some  Members on the other Benches are trying to justify  that, but it is unacceptable. Third-level education should be there for  people from all backgrounds, particularly disadvantaged backgrounds, to avail  themselves of, without being lumbered with debt when they go out into the  workforce after three or four years at university.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Queen&rsquo;s University has received somewhere in the region of  &pound;90 million in one year. What is the quality of the education that students are  receiving? Have the courses improved? What about the facilities? Has employability  improved? We do not know the answers to any of those questions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Nevertheless, the Assembly has gathered to debate an  increase to tuition fees, albeit at the rate of inflation. The Assembly must,  however, send out the message, as Mr Attwood said earlier, that it is opposed  to tuition fees. That has been Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s consistent position throughout the  ongoing debate on tuition fees of the past several years. Indeed, my party has  proposed the motion. I appeal to Members to oppose an increase in tuition fees.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>:  This has been an interesting debate. I do not  wish to repeat other Members&rsquo; arguments. However, there are so many  issues that relate to tuition fees that what is really needed &mdash; as Ms Ramsey  said &mdash; is a full review of the entire matter. I note with interest that every  party seems to have opposed tuition fees back in 2000 and 2001 &mdash; long before I  was elected to the Assembly. A bit of  consistency is not a bad thing. Ideally, there should be &mdash; and I get the  feeling that there is &mdash; unanimity on that issue. Theoretically, perhaps, it is impossible to take a decision, because the  Assembly does not know from where the necessary finance will come.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Does the Member agree that, before the establishment of the current Assembly,  the DUP promised the electorate a &pound;1 billion bonanza from Gordon Brown, which  has not materialised?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: That could be the answer. Many promises are made at certain times during a four-year  cycle. Another &pound;1 billion is represented by the cost of segregation,  which was identified by my party and is continually referred to in the Chamber.  Recently, that figure was amplified to &pound;1&middot;5 billion by Deloitte. Perhaps there  is scope for the necessary money to come from that total.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the meantime, however, my party believes that the situation is characterised by too many  imponderables and questions that must be answered by a proper review.  Therefore, the only sensible course of action is to support the prayer of  annulment and not to add any further burden to graduates, even if that burden  might be small, in hard cash terms. The Assembly must send out a signal that,  if the amount involved is just &pound;2&middot;5 million, which is not a huge amount, surely  it could be covered by the universities for one year. Alternatively, perhaps,  if the Minister were to obtain a better deal from the Department of Finance and  Personnel, that shortfall could be covered by the DEL budget. I certainly hope so. In the  meantime, the Alliance Party will support the prayer of annulment.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Standing Orders require that Question Time must take place at 2.30  pm. Therefore, I propose that Members take their ease until that time. This  debate will recommence at 4.00 pm, when the Minister  for Employment and Learning, Sir Reg Empey, will speak.</p>

	      <p class="H3SectionHeading">Office of the first Minister and deputy First  minister</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Single Equality Bill</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Ms Lo </strong>asked  the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister to make a statement  on a single equality Bill, in light of the draft Programme for Government.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO1204/08> (AQO 1204/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister (Rev Dr Ian Paisley)</strong>: The single equality Bill was a Programme for  Government commitment of the previous  Executive, and a significant amount of work has been completed as a  consequence. Since that commitment was made, additional equality legislation  has been introduced that provides further protections across a range of  grounds. We have not yet taken decisions on policy proposals; any policy  proposals for single equality legislation will be considered in consultation  with the Committee for the Office of the  First Minister and deputy First Minister (OFMDFM) and the Executive.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, the single equality Bill was a Programme for Government commitment of the previous  Executive. The intention was that it would provide a clear and  accessible framework of equality law for Northern Ireland in one legal  instrument, which, as far as was practicable, would harmonise existing  provisions. Northern Ireland  has a significant body of equality legislation, so this represents a  significant and complex piece of work.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There have been significant consultations to date on the  Bill, and two public consultations were held &mdash; in 2001 and in 2004. In line  with the commitment in the St Andrews Agreement to develop policy proposals for  an incoming Executive, there was further engagement with key stakeholders. Subject to a ministerial decision, it is  anticipated that there will be a formal public consult&shy;ation on final policy  proposals. At present, officials are engaging with advisers and preparing a  submission for Ministers on potential options.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: I  thank the First Minister for his response.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Given that there is not a single mention of a single  equality Bill in the three-year draft Programme for Government, is this another case of the political differ&shy;ences  between the First Minister and the deputy First Minister leading to a freeze on  any legislation that they regard as controversial?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I have given the full position of our stand on this issue and the  work that is being done on it. Our targets are to introduce measures to work  towards the total elimination of the gender pay gap and to work across  Government to reform the tribunals system to enhance the enforcement of rights.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong><span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt; ">Mr K Robinson</span></strong>: Given that the Equality Commission is the enforcer of any  equality legislation and that it is a body for which the First Minister has  oversight responsibility, what significant steps will the First Minister take  to ensure that the commission will address the problem that its staff is 34&middot;5%  male compared with 65&middot;5% female, and is  made up of 35&middot;43% Protestants compared with 63&middot;3% Roman Catholics,  despite its declared mission to advance equality and promote equality of opportunity?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I am glad that the Member has raised  this matter. I will take it up with the chief commis&shy;sioner, and we will  test it out with her.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  With him.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  Will the First Minister clarify whether Members would be wrong to read his  earlier response as an indication that all the statements on equality in the  draft Programme for Government do not amount to a commitment to a single  equality Bill?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Does the First Minister  agree that the various state&shy;<span style="letter-spacing:-.35pt; ">ments </span>on equality in the draft Programme for Government  provide a policy cover, or policy basis, for  the statement that was made by the Minister of Education last week regarding the future of post-primary  education?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First Minister</strong>: It is for the Executive Committee and  the Assembly to take action on those matters. This is the place in which to  settle those matters &mdash; they cannot be settled by something done in the past.  This House is the final appeal court of the country.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Question 2 has been withdrawn.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Third International Conference on Services and  Innovation</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Mr  McFarland </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister  to make a statement on its recent participation in the third international  conference on services and innovation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO1195/08>(AQO  1193/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First Minister</strong>: The third international conference on  services and innovation was an important event, which focused on the significant economic opportunities presented  by the growth of the services sector, and on how innovation can help to build  competitiveness in that sector and drive overall economic growth. It took place  at the Royal Hospital,  Kilmainham, Dublin,  on 7 and 8 November 2007 and was attended by represent&shy;atives from business, policy agencies and development  agencies from most EU member states.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The deputy First Minister and Mr Brian Cowen TD delivered the opening addresses of the  conference. A press release outlining the deputy First Minister&rsquo;s  attendance at the conference was issued at  the time and is available from our joint Office&rsquo;s website.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McFarland</strong>:  I note that on day two of the conference, the delegates discussed how to  develop a supportive and flexible enterprise  environment for service providers. What is the First Minister, in his  role as the Executive&rsquo;s economic policy co-ordinator, doing to achieve that  objective in his draft Programme for Government?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: We must address structural weaknesses in our economy and become  innovative and productive. Our focus will be on growing the private sector,  including attracting high-value foreign direct investment, supporting  indigenous enterprises and promoting growth in well-paid, high-skilled jobs  that will be sustainable in the longer term. The draft Programme for Government  aims to increase the skills of our workforce, reduce economic inactivity and  enable our companies to become more innovative and invest more in research and  development.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  I thank the First Minister for his answers on this important issue, but I want  to probe a little further. He has commented  at length on the private sector, but I would like to draw attention to  the public sector and our Civil Service. Is he aware of the current state of  progress on e-Government? What plans are there to implement modern electronic  methods of customer service by our Departments? I realise that this is a  complicated question, but will OFMFDM make an early statement on the matter?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: The Member admits that it is a complicated business. It must be  discussed carefully and thoroughly by the Executive and debated by the  Assembly. We will take any opportunity that arises to announce progress, but we  must make progress before issuing statements. There is no use in making  covering statements. Let us get to the heart of the matter.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  Will the First Minister tell the House which  key industries are being targeted by the Executive in order to attract  new investment to Northern    Ireland?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: Being greedy, we are targeting all of them. Many parts of our  economy need help, and as I have said  elsewhere, we must lift our economy from dependence on so many low-paid  jobs and strengthen its infrastructure.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is not a job that is done in a day. I might say that Rome was not built in a  day, although that is a bad analogy in this affair.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Public Appointments</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mr Burns </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister to confirm  that all public appointments should be  based on the principle of merit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO1258/08>(AQO  1258/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: Ministerial appointments to public  bodies are, where appropriate, made in accordance with the code of  practice published by the independent Commissioner for Public Appointments. The  code of practice sets out appointment procedures, which are founded on the  principles of selection based on merit, independent scrutiny in the selection  process, equality of opportunity and a  process that is open and transparent. The code of practice also requires  Departments to comply with their statutory duty under section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 when making  ministerial appointments to public bodies.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burns</strong>:  Can the First Minister assure the House that that will be the case in respect  of the appointment of the Victims Commissioner? Will the Minister give an  update on the appointment process?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: On 8 October 2007, the deputy First Minister and I announced our  intention to extend the appointments process for the Commissioner for Victims and Survivors. That process is almost  complete, and we hope to announce the appointment before the end of the  year.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: If  the First Minister accepts the principle of merit as pre-eminent in public  appointments, does his Office&rsquo;s insistence in reopening the process of  appointing a Victim&rsquo;s Commissioner not constitute political interference, given  that the persons who made the shortlist under the previous selection process  were all deemed &mdash; in his own words &mdash; to be:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;appointable and of high calibre and commitment&rdquo;?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: My office is dedicated to the defence of victims, and we believe  that, having seen a change in the political background of our country, the  people who would not have put forward their names under the last regime of  direct rule, will do so now, and they have done so. Everyone should co-operate  with that fact, and everyone is entitled to put his or her name forward. I  believe in merit, and I regret that the beginning of the process did not stick  to merit. If it had stuck to merit, the facts that have been given by an  honourable Member today for investigation would not be before the House.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Robert  Coulter</strong>: The First Minister has answered part of my question; nevertheless,  I shall ask it. Will he explain how appointments are made to the central  appointments unit in OFMDFM, how many officials  are involved in the unit, how they are recruited, to whom they are  answerable, what audits have been carried out on their performance in the past  five years, and whether those audits are made public?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I will be happy to write to the honourable Member and give him  all the facts that he wants. We have nothing to hide. In fact, I have not yet  met some of the officials that I am supposed to be dealing with. When there are  over 500 of them, that cannot be done in a day.</p>

	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Trip to the USA</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mr  Easton </strong>asked the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister to  make a statement on its recent trip to the USA.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO1173/08> (AQO 1173/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: Last week, the deputy First Minister and I visited New York and Washington   DC at the invitation of President  Bush.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We met political and business leaders to promote the clear message that we had come to develop  economic opportunities and to invite companies to invest in Northern Ireland  and also to attend the investment conference here next year. The junior  Minister Ian Paisley Jnr accompanied us  throughout the programme, Minister Nigel Dodds joined us in New York, and Mr Danny Kennedy met up with us in Washington DC.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We attended over 20 meetings  and met more than 150 chief  executives from companies that are involved in the financial services,  information technology and services sectors. The businesspeople confirmed their  intention to visit us and were supportive  of our new message that Northern Ireland  is open for business and that Northern    Ireland is good for business. Our mission  generated substantial publicity in the targeted business media.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">New York&rsquo;s  business community invited the deputy First  Minister and me to open day trading at NASDAQ. CNN, Bloomberg Television  and Fox News broadcast live television coverage of the event to many millions  of viewers, and our message that Northern Ireland is open for  business and is good for business was seen across the world. That event was  also displayed on a seven-storey-high screen that overlooks Times Square in New York. The two people  who appeared on the screen may not have enhanced the message, but the proof of  the propaganda was there for all to see.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We met the editorial boards of &lsquo;The Wall Street Journal&rsquo; and &lsquo;The Washington Post&rsquo;, who  questioned us at great length on our business proposition and on why US companies should consider working with us. We were able to convince those hard-nosed  business journalists that Northern Ireland  offers a viable product.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We were fortunate to meet New York&rsquo;s mayor, Michael Bloomberg, who is  an extremely busy man and a successful businessperson in his own right. He  accepted our invitation to lead a business delegation to Northern Ireland next year to build on our economic  relationship with the United    States. We also met the Secretary of Commerce, who committed his  Department to supporting the conference next May.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Several private meetings were held with senior business leaders who are interested in visiting Northern Ireland to investigate business opportunities. My  colleagues and I invited them to contact us any time if there is anything that we can do to assist them to  locate here.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The political attention  that we received in Washington DC was unprecedented. Over 20 Members of Congress  broke off from an important debate to meet us. They congratulated the Assembly  on its work and pledged their support for strengthening the links between the  Assembly and Congress. Indeed, the Speaker of the House of Representatives left  the Chair to spend some time with us.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Senator Kennedy hosted a  briefing with eight Senators, with whom we had an open discussion on  future work priorities. The Senators asked how they could be of use to the  Executive, and we discussed several economic issues and funding opportunities.  Everyone in the Chamber is aware of the pressures that politicians face during  election campaigns, and we were delighted when Senator Clinton took time out  from her campaign to meet us &mdash; usually people go to see her, but she came to  see us. The Senator was delighted with the progress that has been made in Northern Ireland  and said that, if she becomes President, the door of the White House will  always be open to us.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Senator Chris Dodd broke off from his election campaign to  meet us and offer his support. We were delighted to receive an invitation to  meet the President, and we were so engaged in those discussions that the meeting lasted for over an hour, even though it  was due to last for only 12 minutes. We asked the President to consider  sending senior representatives of his Admini&shy;stration to the conference, and he  agreed to use his personal influence to encourage companies to come to see us.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The political access that we had throughout the visit was a  surprise to many. Even Senator Kennedy said that he was amazed at our level of  access and at the people whom we met. That is a solid demonstration of the  interest from the United    States, and we must build on that for the  good of our people. Many business people and politicians who spoke to us about  our investment message said that we were now speaking the language that they  wanted to hear. We have made many new friends and potential business partners,  and we look forward to their visiting us and investing in us.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank all my Assembly  colleagues who accompanied us and who helped to make the visit so  successful. I include the deputy First Minister in that remark, as he would  wish to be associated with it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A man came up to speak to me at a conference and told me  that he was my third cousin, so we traced back our history. Then, I was told  afterwards &mdash; I wish that I had known at the time &mdash; that he had just sold his  business for over &pound;700 million.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burns</strong>: He  was definitely a relation.<span class="Italic"> [Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I would not say that, but I hope that he will do what he  promised, which is to help us to get businesses to invest in Northern Ireland.  That man will be attending the conference.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>: I thank the First Minister for his detailed reply. Does he  feel confident that Northern    Ireland will benefit from this trip? Could I  suggest that North Down might be a good location for a golf course?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I hope that a certain billionaire will also think along those lines, and will come to help us.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There were a number of purposes to our visit: first, to  raise the general awareness of Northern Ireland as a business investment  location among the wider US business  population &mdash; we think that we moved forward on that difficult proposition; secondly, to open the doors to specific business boardrooms to gain access to  the key decision-makers and to present tailored propositions; thirdly,  to talk to individual business leaders and invite them to come to the investment conference; and, finally, to  provide ministerial support and endorsement to businesses that are in  discussions with Invest NI.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A number of firms are in negotiations with Invest NI, and we have assured them of the Executive&rsquo;s  support in coming to Northern    Ireland. We hope to continue our contact with the chief executives of those  companies and to support Invest Northern Ireland in securing that investment  over the coming years.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I congratulate the First Minister and thank him for his detailed reply. I, too,  commend the important economic initiative that took place last week in the United States of America.  I express my personal thanks to the First Minister, his deputy, and their  ministerial colleagues for the consideration that was shown to me during the Washington leg of that  visit.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">How does the First  Minister see external relationships being developed by the Executive,  the Assembly and the Committees?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I thank the Chairperson of the Committee  that, from time to time, looks at and investi&shy;gates what we are doing. I  am glad that he was able to join us and that he saw the benefits that we can  reap from what we have sown in the harvest that will come.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Of the many propositions that were discussed, one of the  most interesting was the revival of the Scotch-Irish lobby in America. Even  those on the other side said that we should help to develop that lobby. It will  be most helpful when both parts of Ireland  have people in the United    States working together for their benefit.  Therefore, I would like to see the Scotch-Irish lobby being developed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When speaking at meetings, I had to keep reminding those present to remember the Scotch-Irish. One  man told me that he was Scotch-Irish but that he had not known some of  what we had said about the Presidents that the Scotch-Irish have sent to the White House. I replied that I had  not said whether those Presidents had been good, bad or indifferent. Although we met politicians, we kept out of  the political arena &mdash; just as we would not want people interfering in our land,  they did not want us to interfere in  theirs, particularly during an election camp&shy;aign. We kept clear of  that, but we did meet represent&shy;atives from all sections of the community, and  we found universal interest and hope that Ulster would come through and that  we would succeed in our aims.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  I thank the First Minister for the detailed report that he gave in the short  time available to him. Was the plight of the undocumented Irish in America raised  with President Bush? If so, was there a satisfactory response?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First Minister</strong>: Yes; that matter was raised with the Senators who came to see us. There was a  discussion on the issue, and our views were strongly expressed.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Constitutional Issues</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">6. <strong>Mr Burnside </strong>asked the Office of the  First Minister and deputy First Minister to outline what discussions it  has had on constitutional issues with the First Minister of Scotland.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO1157/08>(AQO 1157/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First Minister</strong>:  The Member will be aware that the deputy  First Minister and I met the First Minister of Scotland earlier this  year. At that meeting, we acknow&shy;ledged our shared culture, history and  interests, and discussed greater co-operation between our two Administrations  for mutual benefit.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">By &ldquo;constitutional  issues&rdquo;, I assume that the Member means the position of Scotland and Northern   Ireland in the United Kingdom.  Such issues were not discussed. The Union is secure. The First Minister of Scotland has  well-known views on the future constitutional position of his country. However, that is for him &mdash; and his party &mdash; to  take forward with the people of Scotland,  and has no bearing on the future government of our country.</p>

	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burnside</strong>:  Will the First Minister withdraw his support for the Scottish First Minister&rsquo;s  statement that he wished in the future that The Queen should become queen of  Scotland? That could only take place after the ending of the 1707 Act of Union.  Will he disassociate himself from those remarks and give a commitment that the  only queen that we will have in the future in the United Kingdom of Great  Britain and Northern Ireland will hold a unitary crown &mdash; one crown, and one  queen for the whole of the United Kingdom?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Please be brief, First Minister.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: The Queen is the queen of Scotland,  and I would like her always to be the queen of Scotland. However, Scotland has a  right to decide for itself, and whatever it decides is not our business.  Everybody knows that I believe in the Union and stand for the Union; a union of  Scotland, England, Wales  and Northern Ireland.  However, that does not prevent me from speaking to the First Minister of  Scotland. The First Minister of Scotland is a member of the Privy Council, and  I would advise the honourable Member to read the oath of the Privy Council and  then decide a person&rsquo;s loyalty.</p>

	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Procurement of Local Produce</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mrs  McGill </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development to detail  what progress is being made in securing a strategy of procurement of local  produce by other Departments.&nbsp; <a name=AQO1216/08>(AQO  1216/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development (Ms Gildernew)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a  Cheann Comhairle. Strict restraints on public procure&shy;ment are set out in EU  legislation. Nevertheless, I believe that the North produces a wholesome  quality product that more than meets the public procurement criteria. Our  challenge is to ensure that the agrifood industry is in a strong position to  tender for contracts and that contracts are  accessible for small and medium-sized businesses to deliver.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety  and the Department of Education are key players in the procurement of  food contracts, and that is why I met recently with Ministers Ruane and  McGimpsey to discuss the possibilities for increasing public-sector procurement  for local food. My officials are working with the Central Procurement Directorate  (CPD) and Central Services Agency (CSA) to  assist in the develop&shy;ment of a range of guidance to support and  encourage the participation of small and  medium-sized enterprises in competition for Government business. They  are also looking at how to integrate sustainable development considerations  into public-sector contracts.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for her answer.  What action is her Department taking to ensure that small and medium-sized  enterprises can engage in public procurement contracts? Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  Departmental staff are continuing to provide technical support and advice to  individual farmers, processors, producer groups or co-operatives &mdash; large and  small &mdash; to help them engage in public-sector  contracts. I have also approved a new processing and marketing scheme under the 2007-2013 rural develop&shy;ment programme,  which will provide assistance to improve competitiveness of the agrifood sector  and enable it to compete for such contracts.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Staff from the College   of Agriculture, Food and  Rural Enterprise (CAFRE) at the Loughrey campus have supported CPD by providing  advice on the specifications for public food contracts. In addition, they have  had an input to the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety&rsquo;s  initiative that aims to improve the nutritional quality of food in hospitals.  CAFRE also provides a comprehensive range of education and training programmes  for producers and processors to develop  technical and business management skills.  College staff can assist with product specification, product development and the adoption of new  technology. In addition, the college benchmarking programmes can be used to monitor and identify opportunities for  improved efficiency and competitiveness in production systems.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My Department is also contributing to the success of the  renaissance of Atlantic food authenticity and economic  links (RAFAEL) project that aims to encourage local authentic food  producers to develop new markets. The aim of the initiative is to promote the  use of local food as a firm foundation for  public health and ensuring that local food has been brought to the  attention of consumers.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr W McCrea</strong>: On 22 October, I wrote to the Minister &mdash; in my capacity as  Chairperson of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development &mdash; asking  about her Department and other Executive Departments taking the lead in the  promotion and purchasing of Northern Ireland-sourced products.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As yet, the Committee  has not received any response. Will the Minister indicate whether she  will formally resp&shy;ond to my Committee, or  is it now a matter of policy that it will not be consulted? Is this  strategy the only ministerial response to the dire findings of the Red Meat  Industry Task Force, or is the Minister insisting that diversification is the  only salvation for the farming industry?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  On the first point, I have signed that letter of response, and the Committee  should receive it today or tomorrow.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, the strategy is not a response to the Red Meat  Industry Task Force, but represents one of the points in the UFU&rsquo;s (Ulster  Farmers&rsquo; Union) five-point plan, which it put  to all the parties before the last Assembly election.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My departmental officials are working very closely with the  Central Procurement Directorate, which has a key role to play. To date, we have  developed guidance to support and encourage integration of sustainable-development considerations into public-sector  contracts. That work is not being done solely in response to the Red  Meat Industry Task Force, but in response to several issues.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Can the Minister assure the House that  all meat, fish and vegetables that are served in canteens in DARD (Department  of Agriculture and Rural Develop&shy;ment) premises are procured locally?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  The Department of Finance and Personnel is  responsible for managing the Civil Service contract-catering  arrangements. There are three DARD catering contracts that incorporate the  Government&rsquo;s aims and objectives for sustainability in farming and food  sectors, and they are contributing to a better environment and to healthy and prosperous communities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Where appropriate, or possible, the contractors should use  products that are environmentally friendly and that have been recycled or  organically produced. There is also a stipulation that the use of local produce  should be considered, where possible, and the Department wants to see that  enhanced. The answer to your question is yes.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Decommissioning Package: Prawn-Boat Sector</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr  McElduff </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development what money  is available to deliver a phased decommissioning package for the prawn-boat  sector.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO1210/08>(AQO 1210/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I have no plans to introduce a  decommis&shy;sioning package for the prawn fleet. The rationale for such schemes is  to combat overfishing, and achieve a better balance between fishing effort and  available fishing opportunities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Irish Sea prawns are being  fished sustainably and, just last year, the European Commission raised the  total allowable catch for nephrops by 17%, based on the scientific evidence  gathered by the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute. There is, therefore, no  reason to introduce decommissioning for the prawn fleet, and the Commission has  proposed that the same total allowable catch be set for 2008.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. What financial help might be available  from the European Fisheries Fund? Will the Minister visit the Lough Neagh  Fishermen&rsquo;s Co-operative Society in Toomebridge, and perhaps encourage the  Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure to do the same? Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>: The European Fisheries Fund (EEF) will make &pound;12&middot;76 million  available for the local fishing industry, and that will help us to achieve the  overall aim of a strong fishing industry that supports local communities in the  long term.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The EFF can also be  used for processing in aquaculture, and  I hope that we will work with DCAL (Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure) on  some inland fisheries. I will  certainly be pleased to accept an invitation from the Lough Neagh co-op.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We are required to match the money that is available from  the EU with national funding, and there are a number of activities that can be  supported under EFF, including marketing, vessel modernisation, etc. The focus  will be on providing a sustainable future for the fishing industry through  innovation and technology, and that will be  achieved in a number of ways, including new investment, and wider use of the latest technologies,  alongside improvements in the supply chain and environmental awareness. Some of  that new funding will be used to help  tackle social exclusion and promote prosperity in areas that are  traditionally dependent on the fishing industry, when support cannot be  provided in any other way.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My Department is currently working on a draft operational programme that will guide the  implementation of the EFF. That will be subject to a 12-week public  consultation beginning in February 2008.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I know that the Minister is aware of the dire problems facing the prawn-boat  sector of the fishing industry due to red-diesel fuel costs and that fishermen  are working for 78p an hour as a result. Will she confirm what money is  available through any grant or otherwise to ensure that assistance is given to  enable our fishing fleet to remain?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  I have received several questions for written answer and other correspondence  on the matter of high input costs in the fishing sector. I am aware that the  sector is facing difficulty because of the lower price for prawns and  increasing fuel bills. Under current arrangements, fishermen enjoy derogation  from the EU to use rebated red diesel in their boats. Beyond that, it is not  possible to offer any further direct fuel subsidy to fishing vessels. The  European Commission confirmed last year  that member-state subsidy of the cost of fuel constituted uprating aid  and would, therefore, be incompatible with EU law.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is also likely that fuel costs will continue to rise.  That has been the trend over the past few years. The fishing industry must  devise how to adapt to the longer-term  economic situation and the most preferable means of dealing with rising  fuel prices by becoming more fuel efficient.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The new EFF will provide opportunities for the fishing  industry to become energy efficient through measures such as grant aid for the  purchase of more fuel-efficient engines. Other fuel-saving measures might  include the use of biofuels in fishing vessels, gear technology that reduces  fuel consumption, the audit of vessels to identify where fuel can be saved and vessel engineering solutions that reduce fuel  consumption. The Department will look at how it can tackle the problem.  I am aware of the hardship that high fuel costs are causing fishermen at the  moment.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I thank Mr McElduff for raising the issue. I am sure that he will be  disappointed, given the impact that prawn-boat fishing has on his West Tyrone  constituency.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Has the Minister held any discussions with her fellow  Ministers from the United Kingdom and the Republic  of Ireland and with the European Commission about getting support for the fishing industry in Northern  Ireland with respect to the forthcoming European decisions on fishing quotas  and days at sea?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  I want to be a strong voice for the fishing industry here, and I have been  working closely with ministerial colleagues  Richard Lochhead MSP, Elin Jones AM and Jonathan Shaw in DEFRA  (Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs) to ensure that Irish Sea issues are given due importance in the  forth&shy;coming December Fisheries  Council from a negotiating position. I visited the three ports last week  to hear the views of local fishermen. Last Friday I met with Mary Coughlan to  discuss how we could work together on issues  of common interest at the forthcoming EU Council. I also had a video conference this morning with  Jonathan Shaw and Richard Lochhead  in advance of our meeting with Joe Borg on Thursday. The fishing issue  is taking up a lot of time in the run-up to the Fisheries Council. I am pleased  to say that we have had a very good level of engagement with all Ministers  involved.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Crossnacreevy</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Mr  McNarry </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development to detail  the business case for the proposed sale of Crossnacreevy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO1185/08>(AQO 1185/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  I announced to the Assembly Committee on 12 June that I was seeking the  strategic disposal of land at the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute&rsquo;s (AFBI)  site at Crossnacreevy. That followed a review of AFBI&rsquo;s needs and utilisation  of the estate, the conclusion of which opened up the possibility that the  current site could be disposed off without any adverse impact on AFBI&rsquo;s  activities. The Department has moved to the next phase of the study, which  includes the preparation of the business case and relocation plan. At this  stage, the business case has not yet been fully developed, but when completed  it will be made available at an appropriate date.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  I thank the Minister for writing to me recently in English only, as I  requested. It was deeply appreciated.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Crossnacreevy is in my glorious constituency of Strangford,  and I find the Minister&rsquo;s reply somewhat disturbing.  I wonder about her interpretation of &ldquo;strategic&rdquo;, and I am sorry that  she has not, as yet, reached the ability to have a business case put together.  I hope that she will come back to me on that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Has the Minister considered any alternatives to the sale of  the entire Crossnacreevy site &mdash; such as selling only a portion of the site? In  addition, beyond what is required for the farm-nutrient management scheme, can  DARD &mdash; as I would wish &mdash; retain any excess money from the Crossnacreevy sale?</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  When considering solutions to the problems with the farm-nutrient management  scheme, we obviously considered not only the Crossnacreevy land but the entire  DARD estate. As the Member knows, I negotiated with the Department of Finance  and Personnel and got its agreement to my continuing to approve applications  and give commitments to farmers for grant aid for the farm-nutrient management  scheme. Obviously, any money left over from the sale of the AFBI site &mdash; and, at  this stage, I do not know how much that is likely to be &mdash; will go back to the  central pot, and I, along with other Ministers, will be able to bid for part of  it. I am content with the fact that Government Departments must be as pragmatic  and sensible as possible when dealing with  such problems &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  Why sell more than you need?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Minister has the Floor.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>: The discussions with DFP concerned the site itself. I am  satisfied that we have solved the problems with the farm-nutrient management  scheme and that we have given commitments  to find an alternative site for the valuable work of the AFBI staff at  Cross&shy;nacreevy, which we wish to continue.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her answer. However, I share Mr McNarry&rsquo;s bafflement.  Although it has been selected as the ideal site to sell, is the Minister  telling Members that, as yet, there is no firm business case for the sale of Crossnacreevy? Furthermore, is the  Minister suggesting that more money than that required by the farm-nutrient  management scheme will be received from the sale of Crossnacreevy, and that  that money will be returned to DFP and not retained for urgent requirements  within DARD? If those are the facts, how does the Minister expect Members to  believe that the issue has been seriously considered?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  None of that should be new to the Members; I am sure that they were present  when I previously answered questions on the subject.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In advance of the 12 June announcement, DARD and ABFI  jointly committed to a review of ABFI&rsquo;s needs and the utilisation of the estate  that it occupies. As part of the initial scoping study of that review, the  usage of land and buildings at Crossnacreevy were examined. That scoping study  concluded that the relocation of the  activities and facilities at Crossnacreevy was feasible, which opened up  the possibility that the current site could be disposed of without an adverse  impact on ABFI&rsquo;s activities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members must also recognise that the Executive are working  on behalf of all of our people. Although I would have loved to have been able  to retain the additional money, we do not know how much money there will be,  how the land will be valued, and what planning issues might arise. We hear from  all the parties about the other financial pressures around the Executive table,  and, therefore, we must be wise about how Government money is spent for the  betterment of all people. A joined-up approach from the Executive will be of  real benefit to the people of this place.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  What benefit does the Minister envisage for the people of Crossnacreevy in  particular, and Strangford in general, from the sale of this land?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  As the Member knows, the land is currently agricultural land. There are several  potential benefits. Having land available for further economic development can  bring benefits to the people of both Crossnacreevy and the wider Strangford  constituency. I hope that whoever buys the land will consider the needs of, and  how they might interact with, the community. Therefore, there will certainly be  benefits.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We are looking carefully at how staff are affected by the  sale as well as the people who live in the cottages at Crossnacreevy. I am taking all that into consideration and  keeping a close eye on how the situation develops.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Pig Meat Sector</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mr  Brolly </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development what  assistance is being given by her Department to the pig meat sector.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO1223/08>(AQO 1223/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>: Go raibh maith agat. My Department continues to support the pig sector in every way in which it  can. The Department&rsquo;s pig technologists are dealing with individual farmers to  assess areas of potential improvement in production efficiency on farms. The  pig grading information system (PiGIS), which I launched in June 2007, was  developed jointly by the College   of Agriculture, Food and  Rural Enterprise and the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute. PiGIS has been  widely used by producers to assess carcass specifications. Already there is  evidence that, through the use of various measures, significant savings can be  made on farms.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">CAFRE provides a  comprehensive range of education and training programmes that develop  technical and business-management skills for  producers and processors. It provides benchmarking support and delivers  the pig challenge to address inefficiencies and maximise competitiveness at  farm level. College staff also assist with product specification, product  development and the adoption of new technology. Furthermore, over the past four years, the Department&rsquo;s supply-chain  awareness programme has seen the involvement of farmers and others in investigating supply-chain issues and  marketing models in Ireland,  Britain and Germany.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department has agreed with the industry to co-fund a  review of key issues that impact on the pig sector, and that review will be  undertaken by the Ulster Pork and Bacon Forum.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brolly</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. To what extent will the introduction of export refunds  help to stabilise pig prices?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  I met with industry representatives recently, after which I was left in no  doubt about the pig sector&rsquo;s extreme financial situation, which has largely  been caused by the increased production costs as a result of high cereal  prices. The private storage aid scheme that the EU Commission introduced at the  end of October failed to bring about  stability. I am delighted that the EU management committee for pigmeat  has agreed to reintroduce export refunds for pig meat. That illustrates that the major difficulties facing pig  producers across the EU have been  recognised. The commencement of that subsidy is an essential first step  in trying to restore some balance and stability to the sector. It will increase  the amount of pig meat that is exported from the EU and, hence, increase market  prices. I hope that that marks a turning point for the sector, and I will continue to monitor the situation closely over  the coming weeks and months.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Irwin</strong>:  Has the Minister discussed with the Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union possible ways in  which to help pig farmers who are suffering unsustainable losses? Will she  assure the House that she will leave no stone unturned when examining ways in  which to help the pig sector at this time?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  Absolutely. EU funding and support will be  available for the industry to develop and expand profitable and  sustainable markets and to encourage better  co-operation and communications among all sectors of the food industry.  That support will be delivered under axis 1 of our rural development programme  through the agricultural marketing development grant scheme and the  supply-chain development programme.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The industry has also undertaken activities to help itself.  Food Promotion Northern Ireland is a group that has been formed from a range of  sectors, including the Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union  and the Livestock and Meat Commission, to  take forward jointly and fund a domestic marketing campaign. One of its objectives is to develop and  deliver a domestic promotion and marketing campaign that is aimed at delivering  sustained growth, increased market share and  maximisation of profitability for businesses here. It complements the  regional food programme, which aims to promote quality regional food by  assisting the industry to develop and expand profitable and sustainable  markets, and by encouraging better co-operation and communication among all  sectors of the food industry.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>: I  am sure that the Minister will agree that the crisis in the pig-meat industry requires  a great deal more than a nod or a grunt. Will she explain why the gap between  the farmgate price and the price that the consumer pays is widening? Does she  have a solution, and will she support an inquiry into the cause of that  disgraceful state of affairs?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>: First, as the Member knows, I do not control prices. However, I have been working hard with all levels of the supply chain in order to get the  best deal for producers. I wrote to  all the supermarkets to express my concerns about returns at producer  level, given the rising cost of feed. I am aware that there has been a subsequent rise, albeit a small one, in some  retail prices.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That is a welcome trend,  as it provides an opportunity for increased returns to work their way  back through the supply line to the farm-gate price.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Additionally, I met the senior management team of a leading  pork processor to learn at first hand of the difficulties in that sector. I  have also been working with the UFU and the industries to ascertain how to  narrow the gap to which the Member has referred.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Farm Nutrient Management Scheme</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mr  Armstrong </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development to detail  the business case for the continued processing and financing of the farm  nutrient management scheme.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO1196/08>(AQO  1186/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  The business case for the continued processing  and financing of the farm nutrient management scheme (FNMS) provides  economic justification for funding all FNMS applicants and quantifies the  additional funding that is required for the scheme. The economic analysis  demonstrated the value for money that can be achieved by enabling the  agriculture industry to invest in slurry storage facilities in order to comply  with the EU nitrates directive while maintaining livestock numbers and  viability.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The funding gap was estimated to be &pound;89 million above the  existing scheme&rsquo;s budget, and a bid for that amount has been submitted through  the investment strategy for Northern    Ireland. The additional funding will prevent a reduction in livestock numbers to  comply with the EU nitrates directive and the consequent loss of the value added to the economy from those  livestock. Unsatisfactory implementation of the nitrates directive could  result in European Commission infraction proceedings against the North, with a  possibility of daily fines.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">DFP approved the business case in June 2007. Since then, I  have allocated additional staff resources to the scheme, and I am happy to say  that good progress has been made. To date,  some 3,200 pre-approval inspections have  been completed, and over 2,400 FNMS applicants have been issued with approvals and offers of grant aid.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">All eligible applicants should have received an initial  visit from an inspector or DARD adviser before Christmas. All approvals should  be issued by the end of March 2008, provided that farmers supply any new  information that is needed following a pre-approval inspection. More than 1,000  claims for completed tanks have been  submitted so far. Therefore, a significant increase in the construction  rate is necessary. The Department&rsquo;s target of issuing all approvals by March 2008 gives a clear indication to the construction  industry of the urgency in getting the works completed by 31 December 2008. It is vital that that deadline is  observed, as there is no prospect of allowing the 60% grant to be  extended beyond that date.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Armstrong</strong>: I thank the Minister for her long-winded answer. Given the  importance of the farm nutrient management  scheme, has the Minister considered what options are available for financing  the scheme, especially given the problem of the sale of the Cross&shy;nacreevy  site? Furthermore, is the Minister of a mind to extend the scheme beyond 2008,  bearing in mind the environmental impact that would result if there were not  enough tanks for farmers to store their farm nutrients in?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  That was a long-winded question.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  Yes, that was a long-winded supplementary question, and I thank the Member for  it. I think the Member was asking whether further money will be made available. That cannot happen; the Depart&shy;ment can  give only the 60% grant. To do otherwise would be extremely unfair to the  people who received a 60% grant one year ago and built a tank.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There will be problems with building all the tanks for which  we will be giving approval. I accept that finding the 40% to go along with the  60% that the Department is making available will be a financial consideration  for some. However, it is important that farmers build those tanks as quickly as  possible if they are going to avail themselves of that 60% grant aid.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  With strong winds blowing here and from the other side of the Chamber, I am in  the eye of the storm.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister tell the House whether she has been in  touch with her ministerial colleague in the Department of the Environment  regarding planning applications for storage tanks? It is important that  approvals are granted in time to allow the work to be completed before the  December 2008 deadline.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  My Department has had discussions with the Department of the Environment.  Planning permission is no longer necessary for the majority of tanks.  Therefore, that should not be a consideration in holding up the work. Other  factors are holding up the work, including getting contractors out and making  slots available in order that it can be completed. That means that finishing the work is becoming problematic.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In answer to the previous supplementary question, which I  did not catch in full, from January 2008, we will  be in the period of extension. The original deadline for the work to be  completed was December 2007. One year&rsquo;s extension has been granted. I have made  enquiries, both in Europe and among my  ministerial colleagues, and I have been told that the extension is to December 2008 only, and that we will not be able  to go beyond that. I am trying to get that point across to farmers, some of  whom still feel that there might be two or three months&rsquo; grace. There will not  be.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  The Minister has already answered my supplementary question.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member whose name is next on the list of those to ask questions is not in  his place.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Energy Crops</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">7. <strong>Mr  McCarthy </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development what steps  her Department is taking to encourage the growing of energy crops.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO1202/08>(AQO 1202/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  My Department has assessed the potential for energy production from crops in  its renewable energy action plan. In 2004, Forest Service established a  three-year challenge fund to encourage landowners to establish willow coppice  for an energy end-use. Under that scheme, 950 hectares of willow coppice were established, or approved for  establishment, by 45 rural  businesses. A short-rotation coppice scheme, as outlined in the rural  development programme, will replace the challenge fund.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department supports the growth of crops for energy  under the EU aid for energy crops scheme. Uptake for that scheme has been  limited. At present, the arable sector can secure a better return from growing  cereals than energy crops. Work is currently under  way to establish a renewables centre of excellence at the AFBI site in  Hillsborough. That demonstration and research facility will further identify  the potential for energy production from crops.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  What encouragement is given to farmers to co-operate in the growing and  marketing of energy crops? Will the Minister take account of what is happening in the South of Ireland to see how  co-operation in this sphere can be encouraged and expanded?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: I ask the Minister to keep her response brief. Time is almost  up.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  I will.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My Department, AFBI and Teagasc have worked together closely on how to develop markets. We  will also have to work on the taxation of biofuels to ensure that the  scheme is cheap enough for farmers to take up. We are working very closely across the island on this issue.</p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="11"></a>Culture, Arts and Leisure</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Sports Strategy</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mrs  Hanna </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure to comment on whether  the sports strategy can be implemented, in the context of the funding  allocations in the draft Budget.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO1231/08> (AQO  1231/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure (Mr Poots)</strong>: Sport Northern Ireland will have an  important role in the delivery of the sports strategy for Northern Ireland. The funding allocation to sport in the draft  Budget will help to ensure that a start can be made on imple&shy;menting the  10-year sports strategy. Under the draft Budget,  it is proposed that core funding, including capital, for sport should  rise by &pound;23 million in 2008-09, over &pound;29 million in 2009-10, and &pound;42 million in  2010-11.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, full implementation of the strategy also depends on the willingness and ability of all  stakeholders to contribute to its  delivery. The Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure and Sport Northern  Ireland, therefore, seek commitment from the stakeholders to implement the  sports strategy as part of the current consultation exercise on the draft Northern Ireland  strategy for sport and physical recreation 2007-17.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>: We are all particularly concerned about the loss of local  sports and aware of the importance of sport  in participation and promotion of better health. Does the Minister anticipate the closure of any local  facilities? That would reduce  capacity and the potential for financial remuneration for local clubs  and sporting facilities.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  One can never rule out the closure of facilities.  I am confident, however, that over the period of the strategy, new  facilities will be opened and others will be enhanced. Within the budget that  has been allocated, we can have an improvement in the sporting infrastructure.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  The Minister&rsquo;s responses so far have been interesting. He has said that we need  to raise the current level of sports funding by &pound;206 million to realise the  10-year sports strategy. Has he developed strategies to acquire that very  substantial funding? What performance targets will be built into the strategy  to measure whether we have realised the 24 priorities that he seeks to  establish and which I support?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  The first building block of the required additional  funding comes from the central block Budget. Over three years, and in  year 3 in particular, we will see a significant uplift in that central Budget.  I will continue to make the case, and put the argument, that sport and physical recreation can contribute to  significant savings, in particular  in the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety. My  Department will take that matter into consideration regarding funding; we will  also consider the private sector and the delivery of sport and physical  recreation by local government. I hope that we can get a combination that will  produce the required figures to develop and deliver sport as identified in the  draft sports strategy.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  The Minister will be aware that, last year, there was a huge underspend in the  Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure&rsquo;s budget. Will the Minister assure the  House that that money will be used for other capital schemes in sports and the  arts, including the sports strategy, and will not be snatched away by the  Minister of Finance and Personnel, or the Treasury across the water?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Were the Member aware of his facts before he put his question, he would have  realised that a significant element of that money related to the Ulster Museum. The development of the Ulster Museum  would have started sooner had it received earlier planning permission, but  there were objections to the planning permission. The objections concerned the  removal of a shuttered wall, a structure that is like a silo wall. Ultimately,  that was a key reason that that funding did not go ahead.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Another reason for some capital funding not going ahead is  that the Department is waiting for the Lyric Theatre and the Old Museum Arts  Centre &mdash; which have been allocated funding &mdash; to come up with other funding. The  Department is using public, central Budget money to leverage other funding that  should come from the private sector and from Belfast City Council, which will  make a decision soon. Dr Martin Naughton has donated &pound;1 million to the Lyric  Theatre, which is very welcome, and other private donations have been received.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Let us use our money wisely and bring as much as possible  into the central pot to redistribute throughout the fields of arts and sports.  I would rather spend money wisely than spend it quickly.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  Will that money be handed back to the Treasury?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  No, it will not.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Lottery Funding: Grant Aid</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr P J  Bradley </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure to confirm whether  sports clubs in Northern Ireland, whose  parent bodies are not associated with the Olympic Games, will receive  grant aid for their development programmes,  due to lottery funding&rsquo;s being redirected to the 2012 Games.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO1149/08> (AQO 1149/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Sport Northern Ireland is  responsible for the distribution of grant  aid to sport in Northern    Ireland. It will be able to continue  to invest in development programmes for non-Olympic sports clubs through a  combination of lottery and Exchequer funding.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>: A range of groups in my constituency has raised a number of  concerns about the redirection of funds. It is easy to understand their  frustration, because they were told that their development plans had been accepted and that their applications for  funding had been successful, only to learn that the funding identified  for their projects is London-bound. What are the Minister&rsquo;s financial proposals  to allow those clubs to pursue their five- and 10-year development plans?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  share the disappointment of a number of clubs that money is being diverted to  the Olympics. That decision was taken in London  &mdash; not by me. Nonetheless, we are left with the aftermath: a number of clubs  would not have been eligible in any case, but some clubs were eligible and  should have received funding, but they did not.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We are looking to the capital realisation task force to see  what Government capital assets may be realised over the next few years. Should  we be successful in that realisation, for which clear targets have been set,  the money may be used to reinvest in sport, which is something that we wish to  pursue.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  To what extent does the Minister feel that the diversion of lottery funding to  the 2012 Olympics will derail or delay his sports strategy for 2007-17 and will  weaken participation rates at club and local level in all sports?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  The diversion of lottery funding to the Olympics will certainly neither derail  nor delay the strategy. The sports strategy is still a draft document, which  does not have the Assembly&rsquo;s final approval. That has yet to be achieved.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On the basis that the  Assembly approves the strategy, significant funding is available in the  early years to assist the Department in its delivery. The required rises in  spend must be incremental. The Department  must continue to ensure that further funding and increases are achieved  beyond 2011 in order to allow the sports strategy to be fully developed. The  Department did not anticipate, for example, that there would be a &pound;206 million spend over a 10-year period. It did not  anticipate spending &pound;20 million per annum during the first three years  in any event: that will have to be built up. Ultimately,  therefore, I do not envisage that the strategy will be either derailed  or delayed.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Olympic Elite Participation Programme</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Mr S  Wilson </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure to detail what  progress has been made on the Olympic elite participation programme.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO1153/08>(AQO 1153/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Olympic Centres of Excellence</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">10. <strong>Mr  Burns </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure to detail (i) the  original amount of funding announced by the  former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in relation to Olympic  Centres of Excellence; and (ii) the amount of funding that is available under  the draft Budget for these centres. (AQO  1244/08)</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  With your permission, Mr Speaker, I will answer  Mr Wilson&rsquo;s and Mr Burns&rsquo;s questions together. In March 2006, the then Sports Minister, David Hanson MP, announced that approximately &pound;50 million had  been provisionally allocated for high sports priority infra&shy;structure projects. Since then, two separate  competitions have been held, seeking expressions of interest from anyone  who is interested in developing elite Olympic and Paralympic facilities in Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As a result of the first competition, North Down Borough  Council has been identified as the preferred developer for Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  first 50m swimming pool. As a result of the second competition, a further 15  projects have been identified as being suitable to proceed to the next stage of  the competition. There will then be a further shortlisting exercise to  determine the final list of approved projects.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The proposed Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure  capital investment during the next three years under the Investment Strategy  for Northern Ireland  2, which was published in November 2007, identifies &pound;218 million of capital  projects, of which &pound;112 million relates to sports projects. I will consider  priorities carefully during coming months and, in particular, any comments that  are received during the current consult&shy;ation. That consideration will include  elite facilities.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  Some applicants who have got through the second round are concerned that,  although the next step is to present their business case and assessments,  submit their planning applications, etc., to  the Department, they have been told not to do anything at present. Time  is running out. Can the Minister tell the House when it is envisaged that the  second-round applicants must have submitted all the necessary paperwork to the  Department? What is the time limit before which allocated money must be spent?  Is the Minister sure that, apart from large local authority projects, smaller  clubs will have the time and the resources to be able to compete fairly in the  second round of the competition?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Deliverability by 2010 was one of the elite programme&rsquo;s key criteria. I  understand the Member&rsquo;s concerns on that particular issue, especially where, in  some instances, applicants could become engaged in protracted planning  applications that could cause considerable delay. I speak, in particular, of  some cases in which the Environment and Heritage Service is involved and in  which pressing issues must be dealt with. The Assembly must be cognisant of  that. I assure the Member that I will work closely with Sport NI and clubs that  are making applications. I am happy to discuss the matter with him in due  course to identify how progress can be made.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burns</strong>:  Can the Minister confirm that it will still be possible to fund all the  shortlisted projects if the draft Budget is approved? If not, what impact will  that have on the draft Programme for Government&rsquo;s plans to host 10 international teams in Northern Ireland during their  Olympic Games preparations?</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: We  are arguing that capital-realisation funds should be directed towards elite  facilities, in conjunction with the funding that has already been achieved.  Therefore, I do not intend to opt for any diminution in the amount of funding  for which we have applied. Although we do not have the full &pound;53 million at  present, I will continue to pursue that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The significant factor in the proposals is that many of  them can be delivered on time. That is somewhat different from many other  capital projects that are being proposed. In future years, capital money that  has not been spent must be returned to Westminster.  Therefore, it is in our interests to take forward projects that can be turned  around quickly, to use up capital that might otherwise be lost to Northern Ireland.  I intend to use that argument as a means of leveraging further funding for that  important project.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burnside</strong>:  The Minister made a good point about the &pound;53 million that was allocated for  those elite facilities: if planning decisions were delayed and the right  business-plan proposals did not win, we might not secure the amount of money  that is available. Will he re-emphasise the point that those facilities are  available and the finances are available to make a considerable contribution to  the Olympic Games?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">How does our funding allocation compare with that of Scotland and Wales?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  One of the most significant benefits of spending money from the Northern Ireland  block Budget in the way that I have outlined is that that will actually lever  further money from the clubs or the local authorities that are involved.  Therefore, the return on the money that we  invest is significant, and much greater than the original outlay. That  is hugely beneficial for Northern    Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Scotland is in a completely different situation because  not only is it preparing for the Olympic  Games in 2012, and how it can benefit  from that through the development of its facilities &mdash; it has won the  right to stage the Commonwealth Games in  2014. Therefore, Scotland  will have a more significant financial outlay. I confirm that I am meeting my  counterpart in Scotland  later in December and that we will be discussing the Common&shy;wealth Games and what opportunities they might  present for Northern Ireland  &mdash; whether in acclimatisation for competitors, or other elements of that event &mdash;  considering that Belfast is the closest capital  city to Glasgow.  There should be significant opportunities for Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Reception for David Healy</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mr  Shannon </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure whether he plans to  host a reception for David Healy, following his record achievement of scoring  the most goals in a European Championship qualifying campaign.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO1190/08> (AQO 1190/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  place on record my congratulations to David Healy on what is a magnificent  achievement.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: To  become the highest goal scorer in the European Championship qualifying campaign  is a remarkable feat, by any standards. I  have already written to David to offer my congratulations. I confirm  that it is my intention to host a reception for David and his fellow team  members as soon as that can be arranged. We  are in discussions with the Irish Football Association (IFA) about the  details of those arrangements.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his response. That is something that everyone has  wanted to hear. Many believe that his reward should go even further, and that  he should be awarded an MBE. I am one of a growing number of people who  believes that. He has also received the BBC Northern Ireland Sports Personality  of the Year award.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">He comes from Killyleagh, which is part of the constituency  of Strangford, which I have the pleasure and privilege of representing.  Killyleagh is the only village in Northern   Ireland that has ever produced three Northern Ireland international footballers who  have played in matches against England:  Hugh Davey, who played for Northern Ireland  in the 1920s and 1930s, when they lost 2-1; Terry Cochrane, who played for Northern Ireland against England &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I detect that a question is coming.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  A question is coming. Terry Cochrane played for Northern   Ireland against England, in a match that ended in a  1-1 draw. Of course, David Healy scored that magnificent goal in Windsor Park, not so long ago, in that famous  victory over the mighty English.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">David Healy&rsquo;s success has been as a player in the Northern Ireland  team &mdash; and this is the question, Mr Speaker, you will be glad to hear. Can the  Minister comment on FIFA&rsquo;s eligibility proposal, which would dismantle the very  process that enabled David Healy to excel? What steps is the Minister taking to  address that issue?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: As  the Member knows, FIFA&rsquo;s eligibility proposal will be debated in the House  tomorrow. It is public knowledge that I have already written to FIFA, and I have offered my support to the IFA, and I  will take its advice on this matter.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Over the years, and during the worst period of the  Troubles, the Northern    Ireland football team has been made up of people from both sections of the  community. The Northern    Ireland football team can look back on many  great players from both sides of the community, including the likes of Pat  Jennings, Martin O&rsquo;Neill, Pat Rice and Sammy Nelson, and the more up-to-date  players such as David Healy, Steve Davis and others. Football crosses the  political and religious divides, and it is critical that that be noted. It  would be hugely unfortunate if others interfered with a team that has been  successful and that has brought our community together.  It would be a sad day for the people of Northern Ireland if we went down the route proposed by FIFA, which  might, for example, result in Protestants or unionists playing for Northern Ireland, and Catholics or nationalists  playing for the Republic   of Ireland. That would be  detrimental to all in our community.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I, too, congratulate David Healy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Is the Minister willing to contact his counterpart in the Republic of Ireland about staging a joint event for  the teams from the North and the South to wish them every success in the next  World Cup campaign? Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  do not know how appropriate it would be to hold such an event, particularly  given that the manager of the Republic   of Ireland football team  has just left because of the team&rsquo;s lack of success. I can hardly bring people  together to celebrate success when the Irish Republic&rsquo;s  football team is having one of the worst runs that it has ever had. In this  instance, I will stick with the successful recipe &mdash; led, of course, by David  Healy, popping in the goals.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I warmly welcome the Minister&rsquo;s remarks on David Healy and on the wider issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister consider establishing a new soccer hall  of fame to honour Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  international footballers, past and present, with a view to really celebrating Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  rich contribution and heritage in soccer?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  That sounds like an excellent idea, and if we had a modern, up-to-date stadium  we might be able to incorporate such a hall of fame.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Arts Council: Northern   Ireland and the Republic of Ireland</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mr  Boylan </strong>asked the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure to detail the  ongoing programme of work and co-operation undertaken by the Arts Councils in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO1213/08>(AQO 1213/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  The Arts Council of Northern Ireland and the Arts Council in the Republic of Ireland meet in plenary session once a  year and operate a joint subcommittee to pursue matters of mutual interest,  including co-operation on international arts promotion. The two councils  currently fund 22 organisations or projects on a cross-border basis.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, arrangements have been made for exhibitions in  two partnership galleries: the Douglas Hyde Gallery in Dublin  and the Void in Londonderry. The first  exhibition took place on 6 December. Other projects that are currently being  piloted include Turas, a scheme to promote traditional arts, and a scheme with  the Verbal Arts Centre for literature tours across both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  The two councils have also jointly commissioned a major research project on the  living conditions of individual artists in Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his reply and for his  co-operation. Will he give details of specific programmes and examples  of best practice carried out by the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism in the  South, and how he could use those to develop ideas in the North?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  mentioned the two verbal arts pro&shy;grammes, An Turas. Twenty-two programmes were  involved, and it would take too long to describe them in detail today. I will  write to the Member about the projects that have been involved in the past  year.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  Will the Minister ensure that such cross-border co-operation takes full account  of our cultural diversity, including the Ulster-Scots and Orange  cultural traditions? Will he also encourage the Arts Council of Northern Ireland to enhance its co-operation  with the other arts councils in the United Kingdom, so that there is a similar level of  co-operation between Northern Ireland  and all the other parts of the British Isles?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  am sure that my colleague will be able to talk to the Arts Council of Northern  Ireland about cultural diversity and encourage it to promote the Ulster-Scots  tradition, in which he has a particular interest. I will speak to the Arts  Council about its links to similar bodies in the United Kingdom, and what is  happening in the nation as a whole.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s reply, because it gave a good flavour of what is being  done jointly by both arts councils, North and South. It was useful to share  that information with the Assembly and I welcome it. I have two questions.  First, does he believe that we can learn lessons in the North about the living  conditions of artists? The Government in the South  gives various forms of assistance to artists to ensure that they stay in  the country and make a contribution to the economy. Are there examples of  improving living conditions for artists in  the South that could be followed in the North?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, given the importance of developing the creative  industries, will he comment on the fact that although  the draft Programme for Government suggests that there should be a 15%  increase in employment in the creative industries in the North, there is, as  yet, no provision in the Minister&rsquo;s budget to enable funding for that increase  to be achieved in the next three years?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  The responsibility for budgets for the creative industries is shared by my  Department and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI).  Funding is available in the DETI budget for Northern Ireland Screen and for the  Northern Ireland  music industry; so opportunities to promote jobs in the creative industries do  exist.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Funding to create better conditions for artists has  increased significantly in the Republic   of Ireland in the past 10  years, but was made possible by economic growth. The Executive have made  economic growth a priority. Ultimately, if we can deliver a stronger and more  vibrant economy, we can put more money into the arts, sport and many other  pursuits. Nevertheless, the arts have a significant contribution to make to the  development of our economy, and I will continue to make that argument and  identify those areas of the arts that can make that contribution. I trust that  my good friend the Minister of Finance and Personnel will be able to assist me  in achieving that objective, and that other Departments, such as the Department  for Social Development (DSD) or the Department of Health, Social Services and  Public Safety (DHSSPS), will not gobble up finances to the detriment of other valuable areas of Government.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">Per Capita Arts Funding</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">6. <strong>Ms Lo </strong>asked  the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure what plans he had to reallocate  resources towards bringing per capita arts funding into line with Scotland and  the Republic of Ireland.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO1205/08> (AQO 1205/08)</a></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  have secured an indicative increase in arts and creativity revenue funding in  the draft Budget totalling &pound;6&middot;75 million for the three years between 2008 and  2011. I have secured an additional &pound;32&middot;5 million for capital projects, which is  a significant commitment for investment in the arts and cultural  infrastructures.</p>

	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although it has not been possible to bridge the gap with  the rest of the UK and Ireland in per  capita arts funding, the draft Budget allocations ensure that arts and  creativity funding will at least keep pace with inflation in years 1 and 2. The  significant increase in year 3 will enable  the Department to make good progress in closing the per capita funding  gap with the other UK  regions and the Republic   of Ireland. As well as  the arts securing an uplift in Government  funding, I am pursuing ways in which to lever in additional resources  from the private sector and from philanthropic sources.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his response. Given that the arts is a dynamic economic  sector that drives economic growth, especially in our tourist industry, does  the Minister think it logical to leave arts funding at a lower per capita level  than that of our neighbours in Scotland and  the Republic, whose arts funding levels match their successful tourist  industries?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  have been making the case for an uplift in  arts funding. Ultimately, my Department aims to reach the same funding  levels as our counterparts across the United Kingdom. The arts have a significant contribution  to make to tourism and economic development  &mdash; those points have been clearly made. If people visit Northern Ireland only to find that the arts  infrastructure does not exist in our capital city of Belfast, that means that a gap in what can be offered to tourists exists  where there should be none.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The arts also contribute to economic development. If we are  to attract higher-value jobs, the people who will take up those jobs will  expect a certain quality of life. In  attempting to grow the economy, we are seeking such jobs for Northern Ireland.  We must create the right quality of life if we are to create an economy that is  based on higher-value jobs.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Will the Minister explain why his  Depart&shy;ment, in returning money to the Department of Finance and Personnel, has  effectively surrendered &pound;10 million in the past year, when our arts community  is crying out for funding in order to survive?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  thought that I had explained that, although I am not sure whether the Member  was in the House when I responded to Mr McCarthy&rsquo;s question. Most of that money  was for capital spending; it has been rolled over, and quite a lot of it is  being spent on the Ulster   Museum. The Department  spent around 98% of its revenue budget, which is fairly close to 100%.  Therefore, there was little revenue underspend, which is how it should be.  There was some slippage in spending of the capital budget, but the Department  is making up the ground.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  That ends Question Time.</p>

	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Student Fees (Amounts) (Amendment) Regulations (Northern Ireland)  2007: &nbsp;Prayer of Annulment</p>
	      <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Dallat] in the Chair)</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Debate resumed on motion:</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That the Student Fees  (Amounts) (Amendment) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2007 (S.R.  2007/442) be annulled. &mdash; <em>[Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n.]</em></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning (Sir Reg Empey)</strong>: It is my task to respond to the  proposal from the Committee for Employment and Learning. I am opposed to the motion, and I will explain my  reasons for that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I listened carefully to the debate, and a number of  Members&rsquo; contributions surprised me. Many of the facts out there must be  misleading, because almost every Member who spoke said that his or her aim was  to ensure that people from disadvantaged backgrounds could access higher  education. Members said that reducing student fees would help those people to  gain that access.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Alex Attwood questioned why the<span style="font-size:10.0pt; "> </span>Department for Innovation, Universities and  Skills (DIUS) in London  introduced new measures in the autumn. He suggested that that indicated that  student fees were not working. First, Northern Ireland has an excellent  record in attracting people from less-favoured backgrounds to higher education.  In our universities, 41% of our students  come from that general background, compared with 29% in Great Britain.  Therein lies the answer to Mr Attwood&rsquo;s question. The reason that new measures  are being introduced in GB is that it is not delivering to the same extent as  we are.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Through the CSR, I have also secured an additional &pound;500 for  the grant, which, in the United Kingdom,  is unique to Northern    Ireland. The Department works with the  universities, and its access agreements with them mean that students have  access to bursaries that have been set at  &pound;300. Indeed, those agreements include a legal liability on the  universities to pay those &pound;300 bursaries. I am happy to say that both  universities currently pay bursaries of &pound;1,000, which I strongly support &mdash; but for how much longer will they pay  that amount? Members must be careful about what they agree to today.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If today&rsquo;s motion were agreed, &pound;2&middot;5 million would be taken  out of the universities&rsquo; pockets on top of, unfortunately, the &pound;3 million that  they will not receive next year as a result  of the CSR. At this stage, it appears that in year 1 of the CSR, the  funding for higher education will decrease by 5&middot;2% in real terms, which is a  substantial reduction, although it will pick up in subsequent years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Attwood said that the Assembly wanted to send out a  &ldquo;strong, clear message&rdquo;. By agreeing the motion, we would send out a signal  that the Assembly will continue to take money from the universities, and,  moreover, will increase the amount that it takes. If Members were in the shoes  of those who run the universities and were looking forward to the next two or  three years, they might assume that that amount of money would be taken from  them in future years as well. Members must be extremely careful.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The second area in which the motion would create an anomaly  relates to students from Northern Ireland <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt; ">who study in England  and Wales.  They pay more towar</span>ds the upkeep and success of the universities there than  they would if they studied here. How large a loan will those students get to  pay for that? My information is that the value of those students&rsquo; loans will be  based on levels that have been set in Northern Ireland  and that they may face a shortfall as a result. That must be examined  more closely. We are sending out the wrong signals.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt; ">Everyone, including me,  wants people from disadvan&shy;</span>taged backgrounds to participate in higher  education, not only because it is in the interests of the Northern Ireland  economy, but for many other reasons, such as getting people out of poverty and  ensuring that they are at no disadvantage. However, I fear that the motion is  part of a haphazard approach that may pre-empt the review that I have already  announced. We cannot send a message to the universities that we back them one <span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; ">minute yet take the money out of their pockets  the nex</span>t.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Attwood expressed a fear that universities would  increase their fees. A university becomes a member of the Russell Group by  invitation rather than application. The Higher Education (Northern Ireland)  Order 2005 set out the level of tuition fees until 2010. Thereafter, as fees  will be the Assembly&rsquo;s responsibility, and the universities will not be able to  set fees unilaterally, Mr Attwood&rsquo;s fear is unfounded.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  The facts confirm the Minister&rsquo;s statement that people from disadvantaged  backgrounds in the North have greater access to universities than their  counterparts in England.  However, the Minister must address the fact that, following the introduction of  tuition fees in England, in  November 2007 DIUS began to reshape radically how people gain access to <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; ">university in Britain. It increased to &pound;25,000  the fami</span>ly-earning limit under which students receive a full grant, and  it has found it necessary to increase the upper limit from &pound;35,000 to over  &pound;60,000.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I suggest that those figures reveal that in England, where  those from disadvantaged backgrounds have problems accessing university, the  Government have had to perform radical corrective surgery. On the basis of the  inadequate tuition-fee strategy in Britain, it is reasonable to  conclude that similar surgery will be required in the North.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Sir Reg Empey</strong>:  I normally listen to Mr Attwood&rsquo;s speeches with great care, but perhaps his  timing belt is not quite right, or his fan belt is not in the correct position  today, because the opposite is actually the case. He may not have listened to  my previous answer. We are succeeding in Northern Ireland, with 41% of our  university students coming from disadvantaged backgrounds. By comparison, that  figure is only 29% in England.  Therefore, we have a success story to tell.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My departmental officials and I are examining the  announcement that was made by the Department for Innovation, Universities and  Skills. We are doing that in the context of the comprehensive spending review.  I made some comprehensive spending review bids in that regard, but they were  unsuccessful. The DIUS gave my Department one hour&rsquo;s notice before it made its  announcement, but the detail of what it will deliver is unclear. We should  proceed in a logical manner through the review process, with a structure  through which we can consider all the issues.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Paul Butler asked whether the review would be independent.  An independent commission has been set up in England, responding to Parliament.  We will examine that model to decide whether it will fit here. I want the  review to be meaningful, and not merely a play-acting exercise. I have made  that commitment to the Assembly and to the  Committee on several occasions. We are creating anomalies by putting our  students who study at universities in England  and Wales  at a disad&shy;vantage in the short term, against students who study here. Some &pound;2&middot;5 million has been taken from universities;  therefore, they are no longer able to attract the highest-quality researchers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members said that that money should be taken from reserves, and that is fine if reserves exist. Our  universities have no reserves to meet revenue deficits. Members must pay  attention to the fact that universities are giving &pound;1,000 bursaries to every  student from a disadvantaged background. However, under the access agreements,  they are only required to pay &pound;300. We cannot force them to pay &pound;1,000 &mdash; they  are doing that voluntarily. It would be outrageous and a great shame &mdash; and it  would have the opposite effect of what Members want &mdash; if they were to reduce  that bursary to make up the losses that they would suffer from paying the fees. I am sure that is not what they  intended. I do not believe that they  intended to create the anomalies that will exist whereby students from Northern Ireland who study in England and Wales  may face a shortfall in the loans that they will be able to acquire to pay  their fees in England.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The current situation is a product of measures that have not been thought through in their entirety.  Therefore, it is better to start the review, for the sake of a year.  That review will be comprehensive, and it will deal with all of those issues,  including the anomalies that are being created. It would be better for us to  follow that course than to take a precipitative decision. The figures that were  released this year do not sustain the argument that there has been a fall-off  in access.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We will not find out  the final figures until next month, but the indications are that the  number of students at universities is increasing. That is good, considering  that the cohort of 18-year-olds has dropped by 5&middot;5% in Northern Ireland.  We will have to analyse those figures closely when we receive them, but there  is nothing to sustain the argument that freezing fees will increase access for  people who are currently unable to get it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The key thing that we must defend is the &pound;500 differential  in the maintenance grant that we have secured. We must ensure that the highest  quality of university research and education is provided to drive our economy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">We must try to avoid the discrepancies and  anomalies that exist between our students and those studying in the rest of the  UK.  As regards the announcement by the Department for Innovation, Universities and  Skills, I am reviewing all of those questions and will bring suggestions to Members in due course. Until the  compre&shy;hensive spending review is complete, and I know how big the cake  is, I am not in a position to determine the Department&rsquo;s internal priorities.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">With respect to PhD&rsquo;s and the other issues raised, I am consulting with the Minister of Finance and  Personnel and his Department because there are funding issues that are  outside the CSR process. Mr Attwood referred to the money from the Irish  Government, of which I am acutely aware, as are my colleagues in DETI and in  other Departments. We are constantly considering that money and have been in  regular contact with the Irish Government and my two counterparts in Dublin. I hope to bring  proposals to the House in due course.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Now is not the time to take unilateral action &mdash; it has not  been thought through. Although I understand the  concern and rationale behind what many are saying, at this stage the  facts do not support them. It would be a terrible mistake to risk bursaries  from universities &mdash; who are paying well  above what they are legally obliged to &mdash; to save &pound;70. That would be a  perverse outcome. I urge the House to reject the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  I thank Members for taking part in the debate, which has been interesting in  spite of only having been allotted 20  minutes in the indicative timings. I thank Sammy Wilson, who was up and  down with so many interventions that people  got confused about who was speaking.  That brought some humour to the debate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with those Members, and the Minister, who said that  we should wait for the review. However, I disagree with those who said that  fees should be increased until then. A balance must be struck. Two Members said  that the motion was about headline grabbing. Anyone who knows me will know that  that is not the case. The motion is about  honouring manifesto commitments, which some Members should try to do.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In opposing the prayer of annulment, Basil McCrea gave his  party&rsquo;s view. For the record, one of the Ulster Unionist representatives on the Committee for Employ&shy;ment and Learning supported my proposal in Committee,  because he knew that the legislation was wrong but was in line with his party&rsquo;s  policy on student fees.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members said that maintenance grants are increasing,  which I said at the start of the debate. However, the Department told the  Committee that it could not match the increase in England, which caused us concern.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members do not seem worried about financial  implications when they are attacking other Ministers such as the Minister of  Education and the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety.  Whether Members sit back and say nothing or attack when others are trying to  achieve goals seems to depend on which party holds the DFP portfolio.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Spratt raised an issue about the position in Scotland, and  Alistair Ross spoke about facts and figures. Instead of fees, for several years  students in Scotland  have had to pay a graduate endowment fee &mdash; for academic entrants this year that  will be just under &pound;2,300. Compare that to the bill of &pound;9,000 that students  here will face when they graduate after a three-year degree course. Some  Members mentioned the lack of statistics on that: research in Scotland has shown  a decrease in young Scots entering higher education from 51% in 2001-02 to 47%  in 2005-06.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Does the Member agree that, as the Minister  said, the situation in Northern Ireland  is not the same as that in Scotland,  England and Wales? Northern Ireland  leads the way in that 41% of its university students come from disadvantaged  backgrounds. Evidence to date suggests that things are improving, although we  are seeing a 5% drop in the cohort. Does the Member agree that the situation  should be handled properly &mdash; as she said  earlier &mdash; and that the advantages should  be explored to help get the best possible outcome for everybody?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>: Absolutely; let us wait for the review, and not increase  student fees. Let us get it right. I agree with the Minister: we should get it  right from the start. A higher proportion of people live in disadvantaged areas  here than in other regions, but the social profile is very different. There is  a higher proportion of our population in that category already, so let us see what facts and figures the research  produces. Basil McCrea talked about parity, but such an issue is only  raised on the Member&rsquo;s Benches when it suits <span style="letter-spacing:-.25pt; ">him.  I have some research from Sco<span style="letter-spacing:0pt; ">tland</span>, and I want to read it into the record.</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The proportion of young Scots in higher education has  fallen from 51% in 2001-02 to 47% in 2005-06. The decision to withdraw the  graduate endowment fee draws on research by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation in  2003, which showed that young people from disadvantaged backgrounds are often  deterred from entering and completing full-time education because of the  economic hardship that they would suffer as a result of debt. Over the past  five years, Scotland  has monitored the proportion of young people from disadvantaged areas in higher  education and decided that the abolition of the graduate endowment fee is a  necessary step to increase the numbers coming from those backgrounds. Until the  review is complete, we should hold off on increasing student fees.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Like Sammy Wilson and Alastair Ross, I looked at the report  of the Assembly debate on this issue in November 2000. The DUP and the Ulster  Unionists supported the call for tuition fees and means-tested grants to be  scrapped. It was a former Member of the Assembly who brought the proposal on  behalf of the Committee. The DUP and the Ulster Unionists called for fees to be  scrapped &mdash; there is an issue of Members changing policy when it suits them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Anna Lo mentioned the American model &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  I said earlier that Sammy Wilson had made a lot of interventions during the  debate. I will not give way; I have put the  jack-in-the-box to bed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with Anna Lo that we might end up with a two-tier  system in which some universities attract students  regardless of the fee, and others struggle. Some Members mentioned  student debt. It is estimated that students leave university with debts between  &pound;12,000 and &pound;20,000. Members talk about the housing market &mdash; how are students  supposed to get on to the property ladder if they come out of university with  debts of around &pound;12,000 to &pound;20,000?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  No, I will not give way. Sammy Wilson can jump up and down all day.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Minister for Employment and Learning for  attending the debate; we have a good relationship outside of this one.<span class="Italic"> [Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The laughter of Members gives me time to find my last page.  It is a pity that in the mouth of Christmas our relationship is going downhill; I might not get a present.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister is right that the outcome of the review is  being pre-empted by the proposal before the House. I believe that increasing  student fees &mdash; regardless of whether it is in line with inflation &mdash; is  pre-empting the outcome of the review. The debate has shown that the quicker  that review gets under way, the better, but I am disappointed that we did not  get more details on it. Further to Paul Butler&rsquo;s comments, the review should be  as independent, transparent and open as possible.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank Members for taking part in the debate, and I thank  the Minister for attending. I urge Members to support the motion.</p>

On 5 December, I had occasion to submit  to three Ministers a question for priority written answer concerning a  statement issued by the Minister of Education on 4 December.

	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Delivering Choice for the Terminally Ill</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30 minutes for the  debate. The proposer of the motion  will have 10 minutes to propose and 10 minutes for a winding-up speech.  All other Members who are called to speak  will have five minutes.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly expresses concern that 75% of terminally  ill people in Northern Ireland are unable to die in the place of their choice,  whether in their own home or the home of a family member; and that many  terminally ill people are admitted to hospital on multiple occasions,  unnecessarily, during the final weeks of life, causing stress to their families  and carers; welcomes the positive results emerging from the Delivering Choice  Programme which Marie Curie Cancer Care has operated in Great Britain; and  calls on the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety to provide  the necessary resources for a pilot programme aimed at ensuring that patients,  and their carers, receive the necessary support throughout the palliative care  period.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh maith agat, a  LeasCheann Comhairle. I wish to  thank the hospice movement and Marie Curie Cancer Care, in particular,  for allowing us, after a series of meetings,  to bring forward the motion on their behalf. We sought this debate with deep concern, in the know&shy;ledge that  terminally ill people will continue to be unable to die in their place of  choice unless action is taken soon.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the North of Ireland,  3,959 deaths a year occur due to cancer, and it is noted that, of the  64% of terminally ill people who chose to die at home, only 25% are able to do  so. We desperately need a programme, such as Delivering Choice, to address that  inequality and to pioneer a new approach to the provision of palliative care  for terminally ill people that will make the wish to die at home a reality.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion originated  after the success of the Deliv&shy;ering Choice  pilot project, which was launched in October 2004 in Lincolnshire.  Now, well into its third phase, that project has gone to great lengths  to improve provision so that greater choice can be extended to a wide range of  terminally ill patients who wish to die at home. Following the pilot scheme&rsquo;s  success, the Delivering Choice programme has been rolled out to four more areas  in Britain.  It is hoped that such a project could be introduced here, and I thank the  Business Committee for providing the opportunity to debate the issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As Members know, cancer is a difficult disease to live or cope with. There is no doubt that the  introduction of the Delivering Choice scheme would relieve the  incredible pressures on individuals who suffer from that illness and their  families. At this stage, I appeal to any Members who have suffered from cancer,  or who have ever known a person &mdash; whether a friend or loved one &mdash; who has suffered from cancer, to take a  moment to think about the differences  that the Delivering Choice programme would make. Such a programme would  deliver palliative care across all communities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As many Members may be  aware, Marie Curie Cancer Care is a leading charity, which, although  specialising in cancer care, provides care to people suffering from  life-limiting illnesses. Following its inception in 1948, the organisation was  given charitable status in 1952 and has since gone from strength to strength.  The first hospice centre was established in Belfast in 1965, and, undoubtedly, it has  been a fantastic help to families across the North who have had to deal with  cancer. Therefore, Marie Curie Cancer Care has earned a reputation as an  organisation that delivers to those in most need. Its past successes include  the completion of the Living Rooms appeal, which funded a &pound;3 million hospice  redevelopment that included accommodation for 18 patients, 16 newbuild single  rooms and one double room, each with en suite facilities and a spare bed to  allow a relative to stay overnight.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Delivering Choice programme goes one step further, and  the introduction of such a programme here would vastly improve the Belfast hospice&rsquo;s ability  to provide palliative care across the whole of the North, giving people here  the choice of a home death.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased to announce that, over the past few months,  representatives of Marie Curie Cancer Care met  several MLAs in a bid to secure cross-party support for this motion. I  understand that those meetings were very successful and that the comments  received were constructive and hugely positive with regard to support for the  motion.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I remind Members that the majority of terminally ill  individuals are unaware that they have a choice about where they die.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Professionals are often reluctant to support end-of-life  home care, and services are often not sufficiently well developed to ensure  that patients can be cared for safely in the community. If people genuinely  want to die at home, the individual and their families should have access to the services needed to make that  feasible.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">According to research  findings from the King&rsquo;s Fund, the Lincolnshire  pilot programme allowed for a rise from 17% to 42% in the number of home  deaths. I am confident that the introduction of a Delivering Choice programme  here would provide the support needed to enhance the organisation of those  services and would increase the provision for nursing-at-home services, which  will enable more terminally patients and their families to make their wish to  die at home a reality.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members should be comforted by the fact that, after the  service remodelling that would take place as part of the Delivering Choice programme, terminally ill patients who choose to die at home will receive the same  out&shy;standing standard of care as they would have if they were in  hospital.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the Lincolnshire  pilot programme, 66% of terminally ill patients expressed a desire to be cared  for at home, even if they required complex palliative care. Not only is a home  death the preferred option but patients who are cared for at home, or by  specialist palliative care teams, have received similar or better symptom and  pain control, and a better physical quality of life, than those who received  conventional hospital care.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In addition to those social benefits, the Delivering Choice programme offers numerous economic  benefits. Some financially pressed localities may argue that we cannot afford to invest in a specialised  palliative care programme that supports an individual&rsquo;s right to die.  However, it has been shown in places such as Italy,  Spain and across the United States  that spending in that area would release funds that could be used elsewhere in  the NHS and would ultimately relieve financial pressures, particularly in  hospitals.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Research has also shown that individuals who spend the last fortnight of their lives in hospital may  be estimated to require approximately &pound;4,200 worth of services compared with  a spending of &pound;2,500 for an intensive community  support package for the same period of time.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Marie Curie Cancer Care is undertaking economic research to  realise the precise extent of such savings and believes that, in the medium to  long term, for every &pound;1 invested, &pound;2 will  be released to go towards hospital services. The Delivering Choice  programme also goes some way to addressing  the issue of ambulance hours, hospital waiting lists and bed-blocking  issues, of which I am sure that all Members are aware.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Delivering Choice programme offers rapid response as an  essential component. Poor access to palliative care services, such as 24-hour  nursing and Marie Curie nursing services in certain localities, makes it likely  that critical situations will arise that cannot be handled by the carer. Access  to crisis care at any time of the day &mdash; particularly out of hours &mdash; is  therefore crucial to avoid the escalation of symptoms that might otherwise lead  to emergency admission.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the Lincolnshire  pilot programme, the rapid response team prevented more than 550 unnecessary hospital admissions in the first year of its  implementation. Not only does that help to achieve the wish of the  patient but it helps to ensure that ambulance hours are not wasted.  Furthermore, it ensures that approximately 3,000  occupied hospital beds are freed up &mdash; a monetary saving of &pound;90,000 in  the acute sector.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, a  LeasCheann Comhairle, the &pound;50,000 that  has already been committed and allocated to the Northern Ireland Cancer Network  (NICaN) is welcome. However, further  financial support is needed to sustain the  project for three years. In the North, the programme will cost &pound;150,000  annually for phase 1 and phase 2 of the pilot project, which will develop into  a three-year programme. The initial work will be to identify the level of need  in a local area and to map out current service provision. New services will  then be designed and implemented to address any gaps.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I ask all Members to  support the motion and to support the need to commit funds to support  the Delivering Choice programme. In anticipation, I thank Members for that  support. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mrs I Robinson)</strong>:  I support the motion, and I congratulate Car&aacute;l on securing the debate. I also  place on record my sincere gratitude for the outstanding work that Marie Curie  Cancer Care does in delivering front-line services for palliative care.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Increasing the availability of palliative-care services at home fits with the general thrust of directing  services away from acute hospitals and into the community. At the start  of the decade, &lsquo;The NHS Cancer Plan: a Plan for Investment, a Plan for Reform&rsquo;  acknowledged that support for patients with advanced cancer who live at home is  sometimes poorly co-ordinated and may not be available 24 hours a day.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">&lsquo;The Preferred Place of Care&rsquo; initiative was  introduced across the water, and through that plan, a patient-held  record follows the patient on his or her path of care into the variety of  health- and social-care settings that are available. It records a family  profile and carer&rsquo;s needs; the patient&rsquo;s thoughts about their care; their  choices and preferences; services that are available and that the patient is accessing in their locality;  and changes in care needs.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">By placing the patient at the centre of the care plan, autonomy and control are maximised, and many  patients perceive that those have been taken away from them during the  terminal stages of disease. A plan of that nature avoids the situation, for  instance, where an out-of-hours GP, who does not know the patient well, admits  them to hospital without realising that it is their preference to remain at home. That can lead to significant  adverse effects on relatives, such as regret and guilt, if the patient does not  ultimately have the opportunity to die at home.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is also an  economic argument for refashioning services. Reducing hospital  admissions and enabling patients to decide to die at home can reduce financial  costs to the NHS and, as has already been said, improve the quality of life for  patients and carers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Some studies have indicated that every extra &pound;1 that is  invested in hospice care at home can release &pound;2 in hospital services. Dr Keri  Thomas, in the introduction to &lsquo;The Gold Standards Framework: A Programme for  Community Palliative Care&rsquo; stated:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Caring for the dying&hellip;is a measure of our success, not  our failure as healthcare professionals.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">She went on to say:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;palliative care represents the best of all medical  care, bringing together the clinical,  holistic and human dimensions of primary care&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The 2003 Department of Health paper, &lsquo;Building on  the Best: Choice, Responsiveness and Equity in the NHS&rsquo; accepts that if people  genuinely want to die at home, they and their families should have access to  the services that are needed to make that possible.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Palliative care must be more readily accessible. It  continues to be financed, to a large extent, by the charitable sector. There  are marked geographical variations in its provision across the UK. Marie Curie  Cancer Care has suggested that it is unable to provide for 30% of those who  seek its home-care services. However, there is a long history of excellent  palliative care in the United    Kingdom. That must be expanded and  restructured to ensure that as many of those who wish to die at home have the  opportunity to do so.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Occasional demands for assisted suicide tend to acquire a  high profile, but they are the exception. The vast majority of people dying in  the United Kingdom,  even from diseases such as motor neuron  disease (MND), do not want assisted dying. The 1,000 MND patients who die annually in the UK in the main  do so comfortably and with good palliative care.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Approximately 95% of people using hospice or palliative  care have cancer. Some 300,000 people with other terminal illnesses are  prevented from benefiting from that care on account of their conditions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is essential that we  restructure and improve end-of-life care to meet the needs of our aging  population. Some foolishly imagine that the skills that are required for that  crucial work cannot be learned and that they occur  naturally. However, communication-skills training for healthcare staff  releases them from avoidance behaviours that have been acquired through their  cultural upbringing and from the innate fear of death that is present in  everyone.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Only then can they be  genuinely warm and supportive and able to interpret the complex physical  and psycho&shy;logical interactions in their patients.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those involved in  palliative care deserve our highest praise. I support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Robert  Coulter</strong>: I join other Members in welcoming  the motion. The care of patients must always be at the heart of the Health Service; without that guiding principle, it becomes a matter of simple  economics, which leaves the  patient aside. That principle must apply to the palliative care of terminally  ill patients, just as it applies to waiting lists and hospital cleanliness.  Patient care must not be simply an objective of the Health Service: it must be  an intrinsic part of its culture.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Of all Departments, the  Department of Health, Social Service and Public Safety touches areas to  which no easy cost can be affixed, and the care of terminally ill patients is  one such area. However, the use of robust health economics models for the  home-based manage&shy;ment of terminal illness  has begun in the public domain. The Sheffield School of Health and  Related Research was commissioned to develop such a model in 2003. Evidence  from the USA, Spain and Italy suggests that a home-based  terminal model may lead to cost savings.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For that reason, the Minister should consider the  commission of his own study to establish the real situation and to create  financial and health economics models to address it. Too many of the available  studies relate to outside the UK,  let alone Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Almost &pound;400 million is spent on palliative care in England. We  must establish the overall figure for Northern Ireland to give a ballpark  figure to work towards; within that provision there is a broad range of  services to consider. The indications are that the uncosted value of informal  carer inputs to the system is approximately &pound;2,500 per carer.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Much has been said in admiration of the work of the Marie  Curie nursing service. I, too, praise those who have gone into that service in  order that people who are terminally ill may be cared for properly; I also take  into account the contribution of many family members. Marie Curie Cancer Care  estimated that end-of-life care at home would double its existing spend; a fact  that may give us a handle on what is involved.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Whatever the facts, they  will be satisfactorily collated only by a specialist ministerial working  party that will give us real, practical and logical figures from which to work.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Of one thing we may be sure: we must always take into  account the wishes of those who are coming to the end of the journey of life.  In my experience in another life, I found that one of the things that touched  me most was the despair that one sees sometimes in a hospital bed in a patient  who cannot be at home among family to end the journey of life. With that in  mind, I fully support the call for a pilot study so that we can put the care of  the patient and the family first and ensure that a person who is coming to the  end of their life is given some peace of mind and good care.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>: I  support the motion, and I thank Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n for tabling it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Dignity, family support, and more choice between hospice  and home care for terminally ill patients are issues of concern. More attention  must be paid to the needs and wishes of patients who have terminal illness and how those might influence the end-of-life  treatment considerations for them and their caregivers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to praise all of the good work that is being done by  the Northern Ireland Hospice, Marie Curie Cancer Care and, of course, the  family support that helps to bring all of that sensitive care together.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">5.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In my experience of nursing patients and several of my own  relatives who had terminal illness, equality of treatment is essential. The  utmost support should be offered. Giving care at home can be particularly challenging, especially when mental ill health is  present as we have been told by the relatives of people who have  Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. Although there are many variations in end-of-life experiences,  the vast majority of patients and carers want to speak to a healthcare  professional when they must make distressing choices as a person approaches the  end of his or her life. That advice and help must be available to all who ask  for it. It is particularly important that choice, and as much information as possible, are offered in a  positive manner.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The patient&rsquo;s journey, and the experience of the family and  friends who care for that person, is of the utmost importance. The rapidity of  illness can result in some patients and caregivers having to adjust their lives  significantly over a short period of time whereas a longer period of palliative  care may be required for patients with terminal cancer. Carers looking after  such patients and, indeed, those who have reached old age, may have different  and more long-term needs and requirements.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Regardless of a patient&rsquo;s circumstances, the need for  advanced planning to avoid inappropriate management and, in particular,  unnecessary admissions to hospital is extremely important. The role of the  primary carer must be strengthened in order to provide him or her with the knowledge and the expertise to apply  appropriate end-of-life care and, in  particular, a heightened aware&shy;ness of the sensitivity, dignity and respect  that is needed at that time.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Many patients who are nearing the end of their lives convey  fears of the loss of independence and dignity, as well as expressing feelings  of being a burden on family and friends. Many patients believe that pain is  more frightening than the fear of death, especially when suffering from  long-term illness. Healthcare professionals do not deal well with pain. That  issue needs particular attention.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members have referred  to the first pilot &mdash; the Marie Curie Delivering Choice programme. I  welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comments on the possibility that the scheme could be piloted in Northern Ireland. It makes economic  sense to reduce the number of admissions to acute hospitals and, crucially, it  gives patients more choice.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Good communication between patients and their general  practitioners is absolutely essential. GPs need appropriate training in order  to continue the service. With a more holistic approach, the highest possible  quality of care can be reached. An important part of good palliative care is,  as I have mentioned, the control of pain. If a good community-based approach is  taken, without unnecessary and expensive hospital stays and insufficient  treatment time, the dignity, family support and choice that should be available  for all patients will be ensured.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>: I thank Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n for bringing this important issue to  the House. I want to put on record the Alliance Party&rsquo;s thanks and appreciation  to all of those organisations who carry out such excellent service, not only to  people who are in the final stages of their  lives, but also to their families and carers during a stressful time. I  also want to express my appreciation that the Minister of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety is present in the Chamber.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On the Order Paper, the motion is headed:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Delivering Choice for the Terminally Ill&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That wording is most appropriate, because this  issue must be acknowledged for what it is. Most of us spend our lives making  choices in all sorts of ways. Choice is recognised  as part of a civilised and democratic society, and that is all the more  reason why people should be given a choice &mdash; as far as humanly possible &mdash; when  they reach the end of their lives.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is estimated that, when the end of their lives is near,  the majority of people wish to be at home with their families. However, that is  sometimes impossible because of the nature of their illness. We must all ensure  that patients are given every care and attention right up to the end of their  lives, regardless of where those patients might be.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Delivering Choice programme, which was introduced across the water by Marie Curie Cancer  Care, has been successful. That being the case, Assembly Members wish to see the same programme being  intro&shy;duced across Northern    Ireland. I had the pleasure of meeting officials from Marie Curie Cancer Care  recently. Those officials, with  their vast knowledge and experience, believe that much work remains to  be done. They hope to secure the Assembly&rsquo;s support to further the aims of  their group, on behalf of our entire community.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We are often reminded about the huge cost to the Health  Service of admitting patients to hospital. Here is an opportunity for the  Department to invest a small amount of money that will produce massive savings  in the long run. At the same time, such investment will provide the patient and  his or her family with what they require. That can be done only in conjunction  with the local organisations who are experts in that field. Once again, I pay tribute to their work, dedication and  vital assistance to all concerned at a critical time for all of our people.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Marie Curie Delivering Choice programme, which has been  in operation in Lincolnshire,  clearly proves that it represents value for  money and recognises the wishes of  the patients and their carers. Approximately 42% of patients were able  to pass away in their own homes. Deaths in hospitals were reduced to 45% and  the cost of caring for terminally ill patients fell by 8%. Those are the facts. I hope that the Minister  acknowledges those results. The  highly eminent Professor Mike Richards has said that the results:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;demonstrate that close partnership working between  the NHS and the voluntary sector can give major benefits for patients at the  end of their lives, and can be cost effective.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Let us move forward  together and, for a little invest&shy;ment, the rewards can be high. I  support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>: I  am sure that almost everyone in the House has direct experience of the death of  a close family member or loved one. Some Members may be dealing, currently,  with the impact of that situation. Whether death comes suddenly and  unexpectedly, or at the end of a long,  terminal illness, its impact is devastating and traumatic for the  family. In the case of terminal illness, the  pressure on family and carers can be pro&shy;longed and difficult,  particularly if it involves repeated admissions to hospital as the health of  the patient declines. The additional stress that that creates for the person  who is dying, and for his or her family, is easily imagined and understood.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In Northern    Ireland, we are extremely fortunate to have  the Marie Curie Cancer Care organisation. Its work, dedication and commitment  to the terminally ill in our community has provided enormous support to  families, and allowed many people to die with dignity while surrounded by the  most skilled and sensitive nursing and medical care. More than 200 Marie Curie  nurses, across the Province, provide daily care for terminally ill in the place  of their choice. That care is funded in part by the Government &mdash; and also by  major charitable support &mdash; and is free of charge to patients and their  families. The Minister is well aware of the work that is done at the Marie  Curie hospice in east Belfast where care for terminally ill patients includes  inpatient and outpatient care, day therapy, home  nursing and residential space for family members.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that the Minister is also aware of the Marie  Curie Delivering Choice programme, which aims to develop and provide the best  possible service for all palliative care patients, allowing them to be cared  for in the place of their choice. That includes the provision of totally free,  high-quality specialised nursing, so that all terminally ill patients can have  the choice to die at home, supported by their families.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Central to this  charitable thinking is the view that the right to a good death is  fundamental, and that patients have the  right to choose their place of care and their place of death. Research  shows that given the appropriate conditions and level of support two out of  every three people would choose to die in their own home. Sadly, that happens  for only 25% of those who express such a wish. I am sure that most of us, when  faced with the knowledge that we are terminally ill and given time to reflect,  would want to reduce the pain and stress to our families. We would hope to be  able to make a free choice about where our lives would come to an end.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Marie Curie Delivering Choice programme was initiated  in 2004, with the objective of providing services  that would enable patients to make an informed choice regarding their  place of treatment and eventual death. The programme already operates in several  locations on the mainland and seeks to achieve its objectives through improved planning and co-ordination, and  through the uptake of existing local services. It works with local  organisations to apply best-practice in healthcare and social care.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In that context, palliative care in the community can become a genuine option, reducing the level of  treatment and deaths in hospitals and increasing the levels of community care. It may have some additional  outcomes, such as reducing the demand for hospital beds for critically  ill patients and reducing the stress placed on those working at full stretch in  the hospitals as they nurse and minister to patients who are close to death.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The project has three objectives: first, to develop  patient-focused, round-the-clock models of palliative care that serve the local  need; second, to assess and evaluate the economic impact on healthcare services  of more people receiving such care at home as opposed to in hospital, and  third, to disseminate its findings to other health and social care providers  across the UK so that the need and hopes of the terminally ill, and their  carers, can be met. Initial reports are positive and very encouraging.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I join with other Members in calling on the Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety to provide the necessary resources  for a pilot programme aimed at ensuring  patients and carers receive the necessary support through the palliative  care process. We must all work towards the day when all palliative care  patients in Northern Ireland  can make the choice to die at home, and we must ensure that that wish will be  supported and resourced by the Government. I  support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I also support the motion. I am sure that there is no one in this Assembly  whose life has not been affected by the suffering or loss of a loved one,  whether it a close family friend or a relative. It is estimated that one in three people will either suffer from cancer  or lose an immediate relative to the illness. It is a horrible fact that every year 4,000 people in the Province die  of cancer. It can, and does, strike any of us and it does not respect creed,  colour, sex or age.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On 8 May, the Assembly was restored, yet the day was tinged  with a sense of sadness, as one of our esteemed colleagues George Dawson lost  his battle with cancer only the night before. George was a great family man and  a great constituency man, and his loss is still felt within our ranks. George  was one of those who were able to die at home.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is estimated that  64% of people wish to die at home, and yet only 25% achieve their wish.  None of us is under the illusion that there need be no budgetary restrictions.  However, the question that I posed was; how much does it cost to give a dying  person their wish? I looked into Marie Curie&rsquo;s Delivering Choice programme,  and, while I hate to reduce this issue to one as basic as money, I was  surprised to learn that to spend the last  two weeks of life in a specialised palliative care centre in hospital  would cost the Health Service &pound;4,200, yet the Delivering Choice programme costs  only &pound;2,500. So the question now is; how we  can refuse to put in place a programme that is cost effective and gives  patients what they want? The programme scores on both points. Not only is the  final wish of the patient and the family addressed, which is the prime concern,  but beds are also freed up in hospitals. That means smaller waiting lists, and,  hopefully, an end to people lying on trolleys in the accident and emergency  unit for days at a time, as has happened on many occasions in the constituency  that I represent.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">One of the regions that tested the scheme discovered that,  on average, 550 unnecessary hospital admissions were saved in the first year of  the tests, and 3,000 bed places were saved in the same period for admissions that had usually been taken up by the sufferers of  end-stage cancer.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">5.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The care of those who made use of the programme in the test  areas was found to be of a higher and more dedicated standard than that found  in the local hospital. That is in no way a  reflection or a judgement of the level of care offered by the hospitals.  Hospital staff do a brilliant job in the circumstances, yet dedicated home care has been proved to be better, not only for  the patients&rsquo; peace of mind and the  stress levels of their families, but also  for the more efficient running of the health system.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Marie Curie Cancer Care is well known for aiding the  families of people with cancer. The support and guidance it offers cannot be commended highly enough. Many of my  constituents have praised its input and have told me that they could not have  coped without the Marie Curie scheme. The Delivering Choice programme is yet  another way in which Marie Curie Cancer Care provides the best and most  effective care for patients and their families. The programme aims to improve the planning, co-ordination and uptake of  existing local services in partnership with local organisations in order  to apply best practice in health and social care. They want to work with the healthcare system to achieve the best  for everyone concerned.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are, of course, those who have no desire to die at  home. The choice of hospital care should always be available to those families  who are unable to cope with the death of a  loved one under their roof. However, the option offered by groups like  Marie Curie Cancer Care should be provided for those who wish to die at home.  For that reason I urge the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety to work with Marie Curie Cancer Care  in order to introduce the Delivering Choice  programme to Northern    Ireland. Nothing can take away the  pain and the frustration caused by watching a loved one die, but there are ways  to ease the strain. By backing the Marie Curie Cancer Care scheme, we can show  our support for those who need it most.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I ask that a pilot scheme similar to the five schemes  operating on the mainland be implemented in the Province to assist those who  suffer and those who watch their loved ones&rsquo; lives slip away. Let us do what we  can, and offer this option. I commend the motion and ask Members to support it.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I welcome the motion and thank Car&aacute;l N&iacute;  Chuil&iacute;n for proposing it. The tone of the debate suggests that there is  widespread support for motion. Unfortunately, many Members have had some  personal experience of this matter. It is an extremely thought-provoking and  sensitive debate, and raises matters that are of great importance to the people  we represent.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion states that:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;many terminally ill people are admitted to hospital  on multiple occasions, unnecessarily, during the final weeks of life, causing  stress to their families and carers&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is imperative that we find a way to limit the stress and  heartache felt by people who have to endure and cope with a loved one who is seriously ill. It is accepted by health professionals, cancer sufferers and the  families of those who are ill that home is the best place to spend the  closing days of an individual&rsquo;s life. However, according to a 2004 Marie Curie  Cancer Care survey, the biggest perceived practical obstacles to dying at home  are the time constraints and physical pressure that it puts on family members  and friends. The survey also noted that half the respondents felt incompetent  to provide care to a dying relative. It was felt that the help of a nurse would  considerably ease that pressure.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although hospital admissions at the end of life can, on  occasion, be vital, there are considerable concerns that a significant  proportion of admissions are the result of poorly co-ordinated or otherwise  inadequate palliative and supportive care services available at home, which  lead to problems such as poor symptom control and carer fatigue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Beginning in March 2004 in England, Marie  Curie Cancer Care launched its Supporting the Choice to Die at Home campaign.  The launch came close to the publication of results from a YouGov study, which  stated that 64% of people would choose to die at home if they had a terminal  illness. Only 25% of cancer patients are able to do so. The campaign aimed to  double the number of patients who have the choice to die at home. Marie Curie Cancer Care drew its economic  conclusions from a University of London opinion paper, which demonstrated that  to double the number of patients cared for at home in England alone would cost  up to &pound;75 million.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As other Members have mentioned, it is important that we,  as an Assembly, acknowledge and pay tribute to  the vital role played by the Northern Ireland Hospice, which provides  help and support to cancer sufferers and their families in the closing days of  life, one of the most difficult and agonising times for any family and close  friends. We owe a great debt of gratitude to the Northern Ireland Hospice and Marie Curie Cancer Care, and I am sure that the House will support that  sentiment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In response to the wishes of patients, the hospice-at-home  nursing service provides nursing care to patients who would prefer to spend  their last days in familiar surroundings at  home. It offers practical nursing care, day and night, in the patient&rsquo;s own home. The most common need is to  give exhausted carers a break, especially when the patient&rsquo;s condition  deteriorates rapidly or when distressing symptoms are difficult to control.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the proposer for bringing this worthwhile motion to  the House and look forward to hearing the Minister&rsquo;s response. At such a  difficult stage for families, it is one of the most important issues to get  right as it can leave a great legacy for families as they try to get over a  truly awful period in their lives.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  To care for and watch a family member clinging to life is a heart-wrenching  trial for anyone. Such an experience is loaded with stress and emotion, and  sometimes it can also be a character-building experience that, at the time,  does not appear to be so. Only families who have made that journey with their loved one can fully understand and  appreciate the value of having the professional help to allow the  sufferer to die at home and with dignity, surrounded by family and friends.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">At one stage or another throughout life, I am sure that we  have all been touched and have witnessed the death of a family member or friend  from the awful effects of a terminal illness. I can recount numerous stories  from my constituents, who are at great pains to tell me of the help and care  that they received from the hospice nurses and the Marie Curie nurses. The  nurses visited daily, for perhaps an hour in the early stages of the experience  and for hours on end in the latter stages, and carried out shifts so that the  patient and the family were accompanied and comforted throughout. Those  families could never have survived, either physically or emotionally, with the pressures involved in providing freedom  of choice and the comfort of home, without the help and emotional support that  they received from the nurses.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In this day and age, the world of medicine is such that we  are more fortunate than ever before as more and more cancers are curable.  However, the choice, life and dignity of people who are unfortunate enough to  receive a terminal diagnosis must be respected at all times. Their wishes must  be delivered to the best of our health providers&rsquo; ability. I am sure that many  of our constituents will find some form of comfort in the fact that we are  debating an issue that for many years was ignored as the fight to find cures  and raise funding for research was paramount in the minds of social-health  providers. That area of research must not be allowed  to suffer, just as the help and care necessary for the delivery of a  dignified death must not be sacrificed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The two should be justly and appropriately funded and receive equal priority in the health budget:  it should not be a choice between one and the other.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Now that we are supposed to be in a new political era,  there is a huge amount of ground to cover to catch up with the rest of Europe&rsquo;s policies on providing care at home. People  should be able to choose where they die.  Such freedom of choice should, and must, be applied across the entire  Programme for Government.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am proud to state that my Foyle constituency is blessed  with a former GP whose vision &mdash; many years ago, I should add &mdash; was to deliver  exactly what is being debated here today. The motto on the Foyle Hospice  website is:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Even when days can&rsquo;t be added to life Foyle Hospice  aims to ensure that life is added to days.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The hospice delivers a daily programme of care to those who wish to stay at home and operates an  in-house programme for those unable to do so. Those services, added to  its provision of a respite facility and day care, make Foyle Hospice one of the  most popular health facilities in Northern Ireland. However, it is  run almost entirely through donations and  fundraising. Such funding is  outdated and must be supplemented by health providers, and I am sure  that many similar facilities also require Government  funding. I urge the Minister, in considering the motion carefully, to  apply lateral thinking across all the health boards.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The ethos of caring for the dying at home is an old one. I  recall, in my youth, countless grandmothers and grandfathers who were cared for  in their ailing years and dying days by their families. Today, agencies such as  Marie Curie Cancer Care and the hospices care for both the patients and the  emotional well-being of the families.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I ask the Minister to accept the Assembly&rsquo;s call for  appropriate funding. What he gives in monetary terms will determine the quality  of those added days for terminally ill patients. They deserve the finest care  and the utmost dignity in their final weeks, days and hours. I welcome and  support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: Facing up to the  challenge of being diagnosed with a terminal illness is a daunting and  frightening prospect for individuals and their families and friends. Of the  14,000 people who die in Northern Ireland  each year, 4,000 require specialist palliative care, such as hospital or  hospice services. Many others suffer from life-limiting illnesses and could be  cared for in the community, but currently are not. Surveys show that 56% of  people would prefer a home death, but only 25% die at home. Generally, that is  because the appropriate services are not available to support the patients and  their relatives and carers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Today, I announce the development of a regional model for supportive and palliative care across Northern    Ireland. Its aim is to provide people with choices as to where to spend their  final precious days. Society has a duty to provide the best possible care and  support for those affected by  such illnesses. I have spoken to carers and patients about the support  they receive and how services can be  improved. Their clear message has been that every effort must be made to  help people spend precious time with their  families at the end of their lives.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The diagnosis of a family member or friend with a  life-limiting or terminal illness is an emotive subject, and one that has  directly affected many in the House. To any  individual who receives such a diagnosis, dignity means choosing how to manage that illness. That  should be a right, not a privilege.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Help for carers must be an essential element of the service  provided. To look after a dying loved one is difficult and stressful and,  therefore, carers must have access to respite care. Hospital care should be  easily accessible to those who require it, but the aim should be to return  patients to their homes as soon as possible. Their care can continue there,  which is where they want to be. By keeping access to all those services open,  the burden on carers and patients is reduced.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In today&rsquo;s motion, concern is expressed:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;that 75% of terminally ill people in Northern Ireland  are unable to die in the place of their choice&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That is not where we want to be. I want to ensure that the  wishes of the patients and their families are paramount.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">5.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In recent years, there has been progress in the care of people with terminal and life-limiting  illnesses. Some actions include improved training in palliative care for  staff who work in the community, and enhanced care packages to support people.  Macmillan facilitators are now in place to train and support GPs.  Rapid-response and 24-hour nursing teams have been established, and healthcare  professionals have undergone training in breaking  bad news. Many trusts have provided education and training for staff in  nursing homes, and some have attached district nurses to nursing homes to care  for people in the final stages of their illnesses.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to build on the excellent work that has been  developed to date. As well as providing high-quality care, I want to ensure  that patients are fully informed and  involved in decisions about their care. To deliver on that, the Department has been liaising with the  Northern Ireland Cancer Network (NICAN) and others in the health and  social care field to inform our policy on palliative care. I have asked the  four boards to work with NICaN and the University  of Ulster to develop a regional model  for palliative care to provide quality, comprehensive, consistent services  across Northern Ireland.  The new model must ensure that future services are responsive to the needs of  patients, carers and their families.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must determine the demand for additional care; then we will be better equipped to respond and to  ensure that those who choose to spend their final weeks of life at home  can do so. We must ensure that we have appropriate staff and expertise in local  communities so that standards of care are maintained and more people can be  supported safely at home.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must learn from organisations such as Northern Ireland  Hospice Care, Newry and Foyle Hospices, Macmillan Cancer and Marie Curie Cancer  Care, which have wide-ranging experience in supportive and palliative care.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A vital element of the  project will include consultation with people living with a terminal  illness and learning from the experiences faced by patients, families and carers. The project will also work in partnership  with the excellent Marie Curie  Delivering Choice programme to share learning and experience. To date,  my Department has contributed &pound;50,000  towards the development of the model. I anticipate that it will be in  place and piloted during 2008-09, and the project team will report back to me  with recommendations by the end of 2009.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The project will include an assessment of need and the  implications of providing a model across the whole of Northern Ireland  for all terminal conditions. My Department is currently developing  best-practice standards for palliative care. Those standards will ensure that patients are correctly identified,  that services are designed around their needs, and that they, their  families and carers are given the physical, emotional, social, financial and  spiritual support that they need. As work begins to develop this vital model,  there is much that can be taken forward in the meantime.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In order to properly  deliver services in the community, we must continue to develop a dynamic  and integrated primary-care service. Providing healthcare that is closer to a  patient&rsquo;s home and is more responsive to their needs and expectations is the  key to the future delivery of health services. Patients must be at the core of  service delivery. They must have a greater say in how that care is delivered  and be empowered to make informed choices.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">People with life-limiting and terminal illnesses deserve  the same levels of choices as others in respect of their care, particularly  about where they spend the last days of  their lives, based on their needs and wishes, and considerations for  their families and carers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have tremendous admiration for those who have been at the  forefront of planning and developing supportive and palliative care services,  be they in the statutory or voluntary and community sector. I want to ensure  that all those with a terminal illness are afforded the best possible care and  support, so that they can make the most of every minute they have left with  their loved ones.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I commend my colleague Car&aacute;l N&iacute;  Chuil&iacute;n for bringing the motion before the House. I also thank the Minister for attending and everyone <span style="letter-spacing:-.3pt; ">who contributed</span> to the debate &mdash; it has been very positive.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Delivering Choice programme aims to make it possible  for terminally ill patients to die in their place of choice. A number of contributors stated that although 64% of  the population would choose to die at home if given  the option, only 25% is able to do so. Most people will die in hospital  because the decision is taken out of their hands and because there is no  support system to make it possible for them to die at home. When people are  dying, they have very little control over what is happening to them, therefore anything that enables them to choose where they wish to die must be welcomed  and encouraged, and all of the contributors have agreed with that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Several projects across England are aiming to make it  possible for people to choose to die in their own home. The projects provide  the appropriate support for those who are dying and their family and carers &mdash;  it was earlier called the holistic approach. Such projects have one common  theme; that the main focus is on the person who is dying, their family and  their carers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Guidelines produced by the National Institute for Health  and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommend that professionals identify the needs  of people who are dying. One way to do that is through a care model such as the  Lincolnshire  project, which other contributors referred to. There is also a Liverpool care  model that covers all aspects of care including; keeping the patient comfortable by controlling symptoms; when to prescribe  certain drugs to prevent symptoms; when to  discontinue certain treatments and aspects of care; psychological and  spiritual support; and support for the family. The idea behind the care plans is to care for all dying people in the same way, regardless of whether they are  receiving treatment in hospital, a hospice or at home.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am grateful for the support outlined for all the  organisations that provide support services to people and their families such  as Marie Curie Cancer Care, Northern Ireland Hospice Care, Macmillan nurses &mdash;  and GPs, who are often the first point of contact for families and patients.  All of those groups alleviate anxiety and stress to patients and carers by  offering practical help, respite and comfort. They offer an essential service  and are mainly funded through &mdash; as Mrs Iris Robinson said &mdash; voluntary  donations. As a society, we owe a huge debt of gratitude to the work of Marie  Curie Cancer Care and the other organisations that I mentioned.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A significant  proportion of hospital admissions at the end of life are due to poorly  co-ordinated or inadequate palliative care and support-care services at home.  That is unacceptable and must be remedied urgently.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Enabling patients to  decide to die at home can reduce financial cost to the Health Service,  as others Members alluded to. As Jim Shannon said, one does not want to be  crass by comparing human suffering with economic cost. However, the figures are glaring and are something that the  Department must be mindful of.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As Iris Robinson and Rev Dr Coulter stated, in the medium  to long term every extra pound invested in the provision of care at home will  release &pound;2 in hospital services. However, savings will not be apparent until a  large number of admission are avoided, which is why I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s  announcement of a regional focus to ensure  that, regardless of where someone lives, there will be equal access to  palliative care services across the North. That is something that has not been  looked at for far too long.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Most Members know someone who has died due to cancer. The  question is whether that person was given the  choice about where they died or whether the decision was made for them  due to insufficient services? If appropriate support structures existed to  enable a dying person to choose to die at home, I have no doubt that a lot more  people would take up that option and choose to die in the comfort of their home  surrounded by their family and loved ones.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The rights of the person who is dying must dictate the care  that he or she receives, which many Members have said. There is a common thread  of opinion about choice, the right to a dignified death, and the necessity of  advanced planning to prevent unnecessary hospital admissions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members talked about the economic case and the need for an  holistic approach to be adopted.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Minister for his announcement on the regional  model of supportive and palliative care for those  with cancer or life-limiting illnesses, and I welcome his comment on choice&rsquo;s being a right and not a  privilege. The Minister also said that the patient&rsquo;s wishes and those of  his or her family should be paramount, and that is necessary. I am grateful  that he plans to consult with families and carers in order to take the project  forward. I ask Members to support the motion, go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly expresses concern that 75% of terminally  ill people in Northern Ireland are unable to die in the place of their choice,  whether in their own home or the home of a family member; and that many  terminally ill people are admitted to hospital on multiple occasions,  unnecessarily, during the final weeks of life, causing stress to their families  and carers; welcomes the positive results emerging from the &lsquo;Delivering Choice  Programme&rsquo; which Marie Curie Cancer Care has operated in Great Britain; and  calls on the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety to provide  the necessary resources for a pilot programme aimed at ensuring that patients,  and their carers, receive the necessary support throughout the palliative care  period.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Motion made:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That the Assembly do now adjourn. &mdash;<span style="font-style:normal; "> [Mr Deputy Speaker.]</span></p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="14"></a>Adjournment</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Home-Start Funding in the Ards, &nbsp;Comber and peninsula area</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind Members that the Member who tabled the Adjournment topic  will have 10 minutes in which to speak and that other Members who wish to speak will have approximately five  minutes.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  I am grateful for the opportunity to raise  in the Assembly the serious issue of funds to sustain the excellent work  of Home-Start in Ards, Comber and the Ards Peninsula.  I welcome the Minister to the debate and thank him for his time. Most of  my comments will be for the attention of the Minister, so I trust that he is in  a good listening mood and that I will be at my most persuasive in not only  making the case for Home-Start but in  convincing him to step up to the mark with crucial funding.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Home-Start in Ards, Comber and the Ards Peninsula  not only desperately needs funding but its  work demands sustainable support, and its caring staff and wonderful  volunteers deserve the Minister&rsquo;s commitment. From its beginnings as a satellite scheme in 1997, Home-Start has  expanded to what it is today &mdash; a vibrant, caring and well-managed voluntary  organisation. In truth, Home-Start is really only managing what it can, in the  full and open knowledge that many more families in the area require its help.  However, it cannot deliver that help due to a lack of support funds.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The service that is provided through home visits by  volunteers, a respite playgroup and a family group is open to families with at  least one child under the age of five. It is a real service, for real families  with real needs. Home-Start volunteers also get involved with families to  provide necessary employment skills and to improve  networking in communities. There is no shame in seeking help from  Home-Start. Perhaps the shame lies in the fact that too many people do not  recognise the need for the type of service that Home-Start offers. They  therefore remain ignorant of the good work that it does daily.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I know the financial restraints that the Minister is under,  and I am aware of the draft Budget restrictions forced on him. I commend and  support his stand for more cash to be  injected into his Department. However, I will put him on the spot:  Home-Start in Strangford &mdash; an area that the Minister knows as well as anyone  and better than most &mdash; should not be placed in the situation in which it finds  itself. It is begging for funds and competing for scraps of money. It costs  &pound;422 a year to support a child through Home-Start. That is a pittance compared  with the cost of placing a child in care. Some 76% of referrals come from  health and social services trusts, and 30% less is spent on families and  children here than is spent in England.  I am asking for the Minister&rsquo;s assistance,  and I will also be asking his Executive  colleague the Minister for Social Development to dip into her coffers. I  also urge the Minister to ask his officials, and Ms Ritchie&rsquo;s officials, to  pool their resources annually in a set-aside scheme solely for the purpose of  funding Home-Start. Perhaps the Minister of  Education could also be included, because that could mean a win-win  situation for everyone.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A situation in which the general and mental health of  families is improved, and in which families are kept together and children go  to school in a positive frame of mind, is in the interests of the Department of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety, the Department for Social  Development and the Department of Education.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">One cannot leave out the Minister of Finance and Personnel. He should be asked to consider bringing  to the Executive a proposition to  reinstate the Executive fund, or something similar, for children and  young people. I trust that the restoration of that fund, and the idea that  there should be greater departmental collaboration and cross-pollination of funding, will be taken on board and an  outcome brought to the Assembly in the near future.However, for the immediate future I will continue to press the  Minister.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">5.45 pm<span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; font-style:normal; "> </span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The referrals to  Home-Start in my area of Strangford come mainly from health visitors and  cover a blend of communities from all over the Peninsula: the town of Newtownards and its surrounding housing estates, as well  as Comber, Ballygowan and Killinchy. An extensive network of volunteers brings respite, relief and a caring approach to many families. Since it began its operation,  the local branch of Home-Start has increased its volunteer force from 12 to 52.  That not only shows dedication to providing the service, it shows how much the  service is appreciated, and how major are the needs of those who benefit from the work of the local Home-Start  volunteers. There is clearly a demand.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have already mentioned competition for funds, and it seems that a ridiculous situation has arisen in  the area. Complementary services exceed their remit, duplicate those  services and become competitive.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As much as I support the volunteer work of Home-Start, I  recognise the good work done by Sure Start. Sides cannot be taken when families  and children lose out, because one  organisation has strayed from comple&shy;menting the service of another into  duplicating that service and, in the process, attracting and securing funds.  That is seen locally as funds having been taken away from Home-Start by Sure  Start.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I ask the Minister to examine that situation, because  competition that undermines a tried-and-trusted service cannot be tolerated.  Regrettably, it provokes ill-feeling between  two organisations, both of which do tremendous good work in their  respective fields of expertise.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">According to a Home-Start circular, during the last year  extra money was provided by the Government for Sure Start, enabling it to  expand its services to the Scrabo ward in  Newtownards. It has taken on extra paid staff to cover that, and to  start a further programme for two-year-olds on the Peninsula.  There has been no further core funding from Sure Start to Home-Start, even  though it is moving into an area already covered by Home-Start. An unknown  source has disclosed that &pound;60,000 was allowed for Sure Start&rsquo;s new programme  for two-year-olds, which has been set up in St Mary&rsquo;s Integrated Primary School in Kircubbin, and is designed to accept 12  children a year for four mornings a week. It seems that there is no problem  giving extra money to Sure Start; yet Home-Start, an existing and  well-established family support organisation, constantly battles for core  funding.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I do not know if the  Minister is aware of that dupli&shy;cation, but without doubt, it hits  Home-Start hard and causes it serious problems. That situation needs to be  sorted out.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I trust that I have made a good case for Home-Start, and I  know that the Minister recognises the value of its excellent work. I hope,  however, that he will do more than offer deserving praise. I hope that he will  come up with the cash Home-Start so  desperately needs to stay on top of  maintaining and sustaining the service it provides to the Ards, Comber  and Peninsula area.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Home-Start needs and deserves funding. It cannot provide  the service without sufficient funding. If I did not think it justified extra  money, I would not have tabled this motion, and I would not be standing here  pleading its case this evening. That case is justified. I invite the Minister to bring some good cheer to  families in the peninsula area and the great band of volunteers who work  with them, and for them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I rest my case.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. The business on the Order paper will not be disposed of by  6.00 pm. In accordance with Standing Order 10(3) I will allow business to  continue until it is completed.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  I support the motion, in the hope that the Minister for Health, Social Services  and Public Safety, and the Minister for Social Development might understand the  important role played by Home-Start in Ards, Comber and the Ards Peninsula, and  that they might realise the impact that failure to attract funding will have on  the local community.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Home-Start organisation was founded over 34 years ago, and for the past 24 years it has been  operating in Northern    Ireland, which has 22 independent Home-Start  schemes. All those schemes deliver a first-class service, none more so than Home-Start in Ards, Comber and the Peninsula area.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although some Home-Start schemes provide only home-visiting volunteers, the scheme in my  constituency also provides the services of a respite family group and a  family group. I have had great pleasure in working closely with the groups over  the past five years in supporting their applications for funding to enable them  to expand their services. Those services are vital for families that find  themselves in need of support, not least parents with children under the age of  five who are struggling to cope with life&rsquo;s pressures.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">People need support for any number of reasons: post-natal  illness, disability, bereavement, the illness of a parent or child or social  isolation. People can feel isolated in their community; they may not have  family in the area or they may simply have difficulty in establishing new  friendships. They can also find it difficult to cope because of their own or a  child&rsquo;s physical or mental illness, or they may have difficulty in coming to  terms with the death of a family member or loved one.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">At the heart of Home-Start&rsquo;s ethos is the belief that parents have the key role in creating a secure  and happy environment for their children. In the Ards, Comber and Peninsula area, hundreds of families have been provided  with critical support and many hundreds of children have been helped as a  result.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Home-Start volunteers visit families in their own homes to  offer support, friendship and practical assistance; they can reassure parents  that they are not alone and that support is  available. They have a positive impact on the emotional well-being of  parents, which is of ultimate benefit to their children. Home-Start volunteers  provide a time for listening and talking, help with children, a break for  parents, practical help and reassurance, and a chance to meet other parents in  the same predicament.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As funding for children&rsquo;s services faces challenges,  Home-Start schemes have increased, and it is crucial that funding be identified to ensure the future of Home-Start  beyond March 2008. The value of the schemes has not just been recognised by  those families who have benefited, but by statutory agencies such as social  services, GPs, health visitors and other healthcare professionals. In recent  years, Home-Start&rsquo;s continued success has depended on securing finances from  the children&rsquo;s fund.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The frustrating aspect of the matter is that if the  Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety were to implement  efficiency measures, as has been suggested, we might not have had to debate the  issue in the Chamber. I urge the Minister to work towards identifying adequate  funding for this very worthwhile scheme. In the meantime, I congratulate Joyce  Ross and all at Home-Start Comber, Ards and the peninsula area, and trust that  the scheme will continue to flourish in the coming years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The previous Member talked about duplication. I would also  like to talk about duplication for a few seconds: if the Department were to  stop duplicating services in four boards and missing opportunities for the  creation of one single authority and if it were to ensure value for money in  efficiency savings and productivity, it might find the money in the Budget.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.  I thank Mr McNarry for bringing the matter to the Floor of the Assembly. Although the Adjournment debate  centres on the Strangford, Ards and Comber area, I come from the neighbouring  constituency of South Down. Therefore I hope that I will be excused for mentioning some offices in that area, as I am  familiar with their good work.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am extremely concerned that the Home-Start satellite  schemes in places such as Ballynahinch and Newcastle &mdash; and right across the  North &mdash; have been placed at considerable risk as a result of Government funding being cut or reduced to levels where they  cannot function properly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For 2008-09, the Department of Health has advised that  there is a budget of &pound;3&middot;8 million to fund projects &mdash; a &pound;2&middot;1 million reduction from the current budget, with further  reductions likely in 2010-11. I am concerned that  that will result in the closure of Home-Start schemes and a significant  reduction in the quality of services.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In my constituency of South Down, through the dedicated  work of home-visiting volunteers who give freely of their time, Home-Start  provides an essential service to vulnerable families. In Down, local Home-Start schemes in Ballynahinch and Newcastle have been funded by the  children&rsquo;s fund since it was launched in 2001, and are administered through the  Office of the First Minister and the deputy First Minister by the Department of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In recent years, the confidence shown in Home-Start by local government has been welcome, and, if  funding were to be cut, two part-time, 25-hour schemes would be lost.  Home-Start&rsquo;s work is closely linked to the Government&rsquo;s  priorities of promoting tolerance, inclusion, health and well-being and  of tackling inequalities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Home-Start is the leading family-support charity in the  North of Ireland, and its work is invaluable. Last year, across the Six  Counties, Home-Start worked with 25 schemes  to support 1,573 families and 2,908 children. The work of Home-Start  volunteers makes a real difference to some of the most vulnerable people in  society. In the North, each week, 650 volunteers visit families at home and  support parents who are experi&shy;encing isolation, bereavement, the consequences  of multiple births, illness, disability or parenting stresses. Last year, more than 90% of parents who were supported  by Home-Start said that its intervention had made a positive contribution to their lives. Home-Start schemes require &pound;186,000 a year to continue that service  in order that vulnerable families do not lose that important lifeline.  Home-Start NI &mdash; the regional organisation &mdash; also requires adequate funding to  support schemes that are necessary for the  continuation of that vital work.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The statutory services recognise that the early  intervention of Home-Start is cost-effective &mdash; as mentioned earlier, 76% of  referrals come from health and social services. On average, it costs &pound;422 a  year to support a child through Home-Start, compared to &pound;83,950 to place a  child in care. Members must also consider that, in the Six Counties, per capita  spending on social services for families and children is 30% lower than in England.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If funding were cut, there would undoubtedly be major  implications for many at-risk families. More than 600 children and 350 parents  would lose a vital lifeline, and their physical and mental health would  undoubtedly suffer. That would result in more costly statutory intervention,  the loss of a vital community facility, and, if schemes close, redundancies for  a dedicated group of people.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Home-Start schemes in Newcastle and Ballynahinch &mdash; and I am  sorry to go on about Down when we are here to discuss Strangford &mdash; cover a wide  rural area in my constituency and provide assistance for people in Dundrum,  Castlewellan, Clough, Seaforde, Saintfield, Crossgar  and Killyleagh. The scheme has been operating successfully for 10 years  and, in the past 12 months, has provided support for 247 children and 90  families. The organisation has 48 local, trained volunteers from across the  community, who provide a unique service in an area of limited family resources.  Therefore, I urge the Minister &mdash; whose presence I appreciate &mdash; to give  assurances that his Department will reinstate the Executive programme fund for  children and young people. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  Like Mr Clarke, I thank David McNarry for bringing the subject of Home-Start to  the Floor of the House. Given that this is an adjournment debate, I accept that  Mr McNarry was confined to addressing problems as they affect the area that he  represents. With your permission, Mr Speaker, and with Mr McNarry&rsquo;s, I wish to  include in the debate the Home-Start family-support charity groups in my  constituency, which are faced with the same threats mentioned by the honourable  Member and others. The Kilkeel Home-Start  scheme covers Hilltown, Rostrevor, Kilkeel and Annalong, and other  groups in my constit&shy;uency work in Newry, Banbridge, Ballynahinch and Newcastle.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">To illustrate the work being carried out by Home-Start  volunteers, I will highlight the group in my immediate area &mdash; Home-Start  Kilkeel, which has operated successfully for more than 10 years. In the past 12  months alone, it has supported 78 children and their families. The group  comprises 21 locally-trained volunteers from across the community.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">6.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When we talk about Home-Start, we seldom stop to think  about what we are referring to. The true worth of Home-Start cannot be  measured; it is experienced by those who need the scheme&rsquo;s support. That  valuable support includes reassuring parents that they are not alone in the world  when they are dealing with their problems by explaining that many other  families, even local ones, are going through the same ordeal. Some families  require such support after a bereavement.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Support can be valuable to parents who find it almost  impossible to deal with the demands of looking after a physically or mentally  ill child. The volunteers often bring comfort and support to families that are  emotionally drained because of pressures in the home, and that comfort brings  real benefit, especially to the children of the house.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I had a brief look at the Home-Start website, and one  phrase stood out:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Trying to get the fun back into family life&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Rearing a family can be very difficult, and without  the fun that surfaces in the confines of the home, it would be even more  strenuous. Our children&rsquo;s laughter is one of our greatest possessions.  Home-Start volunteers are trained to gauge a  situation, and, as its website states, they try to get the fun back into  the family where necessary.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Peter Hain attempted to address the problems that  abound, but the new Executive&rsquo;s strange lack of commitment will result in the  inevitable closure of the family-support service. That is difficult to  understand, given that the statutory services recognise that Home-Start&rsquo;s early  intervention is cost-effective, with three out of every four referrals coming  from health and social services.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased to have this opportunity to call for adequate  funding to be made available for a proper children  and young people&rsquo;s service. Therefore, I call for the full reinstatement of the Executive&rsquo;s  children&rsquo;s fund.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>: I thank my colleague David McNarry for raising this important issue. Only last week, I raised the  same issue at a meeting of Ards Borough Council, where I received unanimous support for my proposal to bring the  matter to the powers that be in the Assembly. I also welcome the presence of  the Minister of Health, Social Services and  Public Safety, Michael McGimpsey, during the Adjournment debate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As Members have mentioned, the children&rsquo;s fund was  established through the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister,  and it might have been appropriate for someone from that office to be here this  evening to hear the plea on behalf of all Home-Start users.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The uncertainty of  funding and the threat to voluntary organisations cut across the whole  of Northern Ireland,  and I am glad to see representatives of other constit&shy;uencies in the Chamber. I  ask the Minister and the Executive to get on top of this disastrous situation  immediately.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">This evening, we are discussing the specific effects on the  Strangford constituency, particularly on Home-Start schemes in Ards, Comber and  the Ards Peninsula. I must emphasise the  excellent work that is carried out by the staff and volunteers, who provide a  brilliant service for the children of my constituency. In the past year,  Home-Start has worked with over 109 families from Greyabbey and Newtownards,  providing home visits, respite services, playgroup and family group sessions &mdash;  all to help children get a better start in life. That vital service is provided  across the entire comm&shy;unity, in all locations. It is imperative that the  service continues, but it requires proper funding to do so.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I was disgusted to discover that, under the draft Budget,  the children&rsquo;s fund will disappear, and the grossly underfunded Department of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety will be expected to manage and fund  all Home-Start schemes with a much-reduced budget. Had the Executive given  sufficient funding to the Health Service, that would have been a different ball  game, but they are clearly not stepping up to the mark in relation to funding.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That cannot be allowed to happen. Home-Start funds will run  out in March 2008. The Assembly must give a solid commitment to our Home-Start  teams, so that they will have the funding to carry on their superb work on  behalf of the children and families whom we represent.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Speaking in the debate on the draft Programme for  Government a few weeks ago, the First Minister, Ian Paisley, said:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The children of Northern Ireland deserve our  dedication, and I trust that we will live to see the day when they will be  saved from poverty and have all the things that they have been deprived of in  the past.&rdquo; <span class="B3BodyTextItalicChar"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; ">&mdash;</span></span><span class="B3BodyTextItalicChar"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; font-style:normal; "> [Official Report, Vol 25, No 7 Part 2, p360, col 2].</span></span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Ian Paisley should honour those words, put his money where  his mouth is and secure sufficient funding for all the Home-Start and other  voluntary groups that serve the needs of the children that he spoke about. His  wishes will then have been fulfilled.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that the First Minister, the deputy First Minister  and all the Ministers who control the purse strings will listen to the plea  from the Floor of the Assembly this evening and ensure that our children will  be saved from the destruction that will ensue if this scheme falls apart.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  It&rsquo;s my pleesur tae be pert o&rsquo; mony fien orginisations in my bonnie area whut  er ther fer tae help an haud up the people o&rsquo; tha proavince an in pertickuler  Strangford an aw what seek tae bring aboot a&rsquo; better soart o&rsquo; life fer aw whut  leev heer.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is my pleasure to be associated with many of the fine  organisations in my beautiful constituency that exist to help and support the  people of the Province &mdash; particularly Strangford, in this case &mdash; and that seek  to improve the quality of life of the  people who live there. I thank David McNarry for bringing this matter to  the attention of the House and for giving  us the opportunity to highlight the good job that Home-Start does.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My first association with Home-Start was back in 1990 when  I was Deputy Mayor of Ards, and I had the opportunity to see the work that the  North Down and Ards Home-Start did.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have often stated &mdash; some of the other represent&shy;atives  here will agree with me &mdash; that we hail from potentially the most beautiful part  of the Province. However, there will also be some who will say that we are  certainly not without our problems. In Ards there are currently a large amount  of young families and single-parent families who find it difficult to cope.  Young mothers are trying their best to manage without the absent father. They  find it hard to juggle taking care of the home as well as looking after the  children and are under tremendous stress as a result. It is for reasons such as  that that Home-Start began.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Home-Start is a community group comprising volunteers and  paid co-ordinators who support families with young children in the Ards,  Comber, Ballygowan, Killinchy and Peninsula  areas. Province wide, over 650 visits are made by volunteers each week, and  just under 3,000 children are supported through Home-Start Northern Ireland.  They do a fantastic job.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Home visits are made by volunteers who help young mothers,  mothers and fathers who are grieving, or those with multiple births or illness.  The criteria is simple &mdash; anyone with a child under the age of five can get help  from a volunteer who will come to do a few hours menu planning, to help with  shopping, to carry out simple home tasks or to provide a caring, listening ear.  It is no wonder that Members from constituencies other than Strangford are  present to make their plea for Home-Start schemes in their areas.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Respite playgroups and family groups are available to  families who find themselves in difficult situations. Over 90% of those who  were visited by volunteers have said that their lives were positively affected  by Home-Start&rsquo;s input into their family lives.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Home-Start is a scheme  to which people can self-refer or be referred to by social services, GPs  or through word of mouth. Indeed, 76% of referrals come from health and social  services, which sees it as a cost-effective means of helping people and  lightening the load, and reducing problems down the line for children who are  placed in temporary or full-time care as a result of the nervous breakdown of a  parent.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is estimated that to place a child in care could cost  just under &pound;84,000. Many children would not have needed to go into care if the  parent had been given the essential care and support at the very beginning.  Many young mothers in Ards have told me that they were ready to throw the towel  in until they were given help by volunteers who really cared. That help even  extends to training people to enable them to get jobs, to get out of the house and get a little independence, which  makes all the difference for those who are on the edge.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Home-Start has stated that to support a child for a year through its organisation could cost as little  as &pound;422. That makes some difference, not only regarding the monetary  cost, but also to the emotional well-being of the  child, who can feel the difference made in the home.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I cannot stress enough the importance of the scheme for  individuals. Over 350 parents and 650 children in the Ards area currently rely on Home-Start for help. It is also important to the entire healthcare system,  especially in view of the fact that prevention is better than cure. This  organisation is a way of relieving the stress and pressure that leads to family  breakdown. The scheme has served Ards for the past 20-odd years, and many  families rely on it. It is funded by the children&rsquo;s fund, in conjunction with  other sources of finance. The children&rsquo;s fund supplies the core funding,  without which staff would be unable to provide the service on which so many  depend. The organisation is currently applying for other funding, but so far it  has had no positive response. Members can  understand the precarious and worrying situation which the organisation  is in. It is essential for it to further promote the facilities so that more  people are aware that there are people out there who are willing and able to  help them, to provide low-cost clothing and toys for families which struggle to  make ends meet, and to generate income.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, we cannot allow the funding to be cut. I  stand alongside the other Members from my constituency to maintain that  Home-Start does an exemplary job in our constituency and is an integral part of  it. Strangford would be a poorer place without the dedicated Home-Start  volunteers. We must do all in our power to ensure that funding is made  available.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  In my position as a member of the all-party  Assembly group on children and young people, and as my party&rsquo;s  spokesperson on the issue, I have had the great pleasure of receiving  presentations from representatives of Home-Start. Undoubtedly, this is a  charity that carries out a huge amount of incredibly important work with  families throughout the United    Kingdom.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Home-Start&rsquo;s 2006 figures indicate that it was involved in  25 schemes that supported 1,573 families and 2,908 children. It runs a total of  350 local schemes around the United Kingdom,  and Northern Ireland  has great need of such a charity. In Northern Ireland it has 650 volunteers who give their time to provide  assistance.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In &lsquo;Aiming High for  Children: Supporting Families&rsquo;, HM Treasury calculated that a family  experiencing social exclusion costs the taxpayer between &pound;55,000 and &pound;115,000 a year. Home-Start calculates that  it costs approximately &pound;1,000 to provide one-to-one visiting support to  a family for a year in Northern    Ireland, and, in 10% of those cases, the  family moves out of social exclusion. Also, it costs the taxpayer &pound;83,950 if a  child goes into care. That is not to say that Home-Start is a direct alternative to care, but it can provide the  support, guidance and assistance  required to aid a family in such a way that costly and extremely  stressful care proceed&shy;ings can be avoided. Some 35% of the children aided by  Home-Start are on the child protection register.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The support that the organisation provides to parents  covers a wide range of matters, such as loneliness and isolation, lone parenting, first-time parenthood, post-natal illness, children&rsquo;s behavioural problems, and  relationship difficulties. The support comes from weekly visits by a  volunteer who is also a parent.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Research by James Henmann and the Work Found&shy;ation shows  that intervening in the earliest years of a child&rsquo;s life to support parents  brings dividends in terms of getting the  best outcomes for children and preventing poor educational achievement.  Schools and teachers are crucially important, but research shows that our  parents, and what happens before we reach school, are most significant. If we  want to change outcomes for children living in the most deprived circumstances,  we must support the early-years work that Home-Start delivers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The subject of this debate is funding. Until now,  Home-Start has had ring-fenced funding from central Government. That has now ended, and five local schemes are in  danger. If funding is not secured, it is proposed that the Ards, Comber and  peninsula area scheme, with which this debate is concerned and which covers my  constituency of Strangford, will become part time. However, four other schemes  &mdash; Armagh outreach, Kilkeel, Ballynahinch and Newcastle &mdash; will close. Much as I appreciate that the debate has been  tabled and the representatives of  Strangford have had an opportunity to discuss this matter, the issue is  not confined to our constituency. As we have already heard, the problem is much  wider. To keep those five schemes operating, Home-Start requires &pound;186,000 per  year. However, Home-Start NI also requires  &pound;195,000 per year to support and develop schemes in areas that do not  have them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is difficult to  quantify the total impact of the loss of the support provided by those schemes, but, undoubtedly, there  will be an increase in statutory intervention, which is much more costly and  has a greater negative impact on the child, in cases where such intervention  could have been avoided.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The importance of such an organisation should not be  underestimated, particularly when we consider that 76% of its referrals come  from health professionals, who see the value in its work.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Home-Start is asking for continued parity of funding with  the rest of the United    Kingdom. Unfortunately, the Minister for  Health, Social Services and Public Safety was cut off mid-sentence when he was  about to deliver bad news about the Ards, Comber and peninsula scheme during Question  Time on November 5. Therefore, we do not know exactly how bad that news was.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As the Minister has been at pains to say, the Budget is at  the draft stage, and is out for consultation. He has also been at pains to  avoid making the decisions to cut bureaucracy and inefficiency in his  Department. Last week, I was interested to hear his party colleague Basil  McCrea inform a meeting of Queen&rsquo;s University graduates that such decisions had  to be made, and that the current situation is not good.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On 5 November, the Minister stated:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;I know about the real and lasting differences that  locally based Home-Start schemes are making to the lives of families with young  children, and I want to be able to support hat important work.&rdquo; &mdash; <span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official  Report, Bound Volume 25, p25, col 1].</span><span class="B3BodyTextItalicChar"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; font-style:normal; "> </span></span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Perhaps we will see those words translated into actions.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I thank my honourable friend the Member for Strangford Mr McNarry for securing  the debate. I have some knowledge of working with the Home-Start programmes in  my constituency of South Down, and it is a worthwhile programme.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It was disappointing that Mrs Robinson could not get  through her remarks without taking a cheap shot at the Minister in respect of  decisions about which he has answered  questions both in the House and in Committee. Miss McIlveen did very  well until the last 30 seconds of her speech. I was interested to hear her  mention parity. When he replies to the debate, the Minister may tell us how  much healthcare spending it would take to reach parity with England and Wales.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Turning to the more important matter at hand, the  Home-Start programme provides support, which is vital for a number of reasons.  Miss McIlveen said that 35% of the children who are helped by Home-Start are on  the child-protection register &mdash; a group that should be targeted. The programme  provides tremendous support for families from different socio-economic  backgrounds, and it is important that we get it right.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Unionist Party has been at the forefront of recommending early intervention. On many occasions,  it has been proven that outcomes and value for money are much improved by investing in early-years initiatives for  children up to the age of six. That long-term impact on young people brings us towards the future on a much sounder  footing. For that reason, I urge the Minister to support the programme, and I  look forward to hearing his contribution.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Good family foundations are vital to building up the strong  communities that we all want to see across Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The existence of the support mechanism provided by early  intervention is vital to help families and children deal with a variety of  issues, and it improves outcomes and educational attainment. The Home-Start  programme is an excellent model for the interesting mix between state funding  and the huge contribution made by the  voluntary sector. As we all know, volunteers who give of their time,  talents and energy can make a huge contribution to families.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">With the end of the children&rsquo;s fund, we also must examine  the wider funding issue, as a 30% shortfall in funding for children&rsquo;s services  has been identified.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Miss McIlveen mentioned  some particularly relevant areas. A fellow South Down Member, P J  Bradley, is also present. Obviously, Members  from the South Down constituency, which takes in Kilkeel, Ballynahinch  and Newcastle, are particularly anxious &mdash; as too  are those from Armagh. Having visited  Home-Start&rsquo;s Kilkeel branch with councillor Isaac Hanna, who is a party  colleague, and having seen the work that it does at first hand, I am supportive  of that worthwhile programme, which makes a huge contribution to communities  and families.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: I thank Members  for the opportunity to reply to the debate. I have taken on board the useful  comments that have been made by many of the contributors to the debate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Home-Start was established in Northern Ireland more than 20 years  ago. Its main aim is to provide support, through a volunteer-based home-visit  service, to families with children under five years of age, and which are  experiencing stress. Children are a key priority for the Executive. My  Department has special responsibility for 2,500 children who are in care, and  1,600 children who are on the child-protection register. Therefore, I am  particularly aware of the duty to meet the  needs of children and young people who are in care.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Indeed, one of the earliest debates in the Assembly was on  one of the Department&rsquo;s key strategies &mdash; Care Matters. We all want to improve  children&rsquo;s lives. As far as possible, we must ensure that they do not have to  enter care in the first place. Care Matters is aimed at keeping children out of  care, and supporting those who are in care, and those who leave care. A key aim  is to support families who are experiencing  stress in order to ensure that  children are not taken into care, because the outcomes for children in  care are poor when compared with the rest of  the child population in Northern    Ireland. Almost every relevant statistic shows that children who spend time in care are worse off than their  counterparts.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Since April 2003,  Home-Start in the Ards, Comber and peninsula area has been supported by  the Department, through the children&rsquo;s fund.  To date, grant-aid assistance in the region of &pound;182,000 has been  provided to support the salary costs that are associated with the posts of  senior co-ordinator, respite co-ordinator, four part-time playgroup workers,  and some administrative support. That assistance will continue until March  2008, when the current round of funding is  set to end. The children&rsquo;s fund also supports locally based Home-Start  schemes in Armagh and Dungannon, Newry and  Mourne, and Down District. That funding will continue until March 2008. In  addition to that, as part of the Department&rsquo;s core funding arrangements, it  will provide support to Home-Start&rsquo;s regional office to assist with central  running costs. That funding is currently in the first year of a three-year  cycle.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I understand that the project continues to attract and  train volunteer workers. It sees between 20 and 25 new referrals each quarter  and would typically, during a similar period, provide around 20 families with  respite by providing childcare. Its home-visit volunteers also support up to 50  families.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am well aware of the concerns in the voluntary and  community sector about the future of the children&rsquo;s fund after the current funding runs out. Before I comment on that,  I believe that it is important that Members understand the background to the  children&rsquo;s fund, and my Department&rsquo;s involvement. The fund was created by the  previous Northern Ireland Executive back in 2001. It was established to provide  project funding of up to three years&rsquo; duration to voluntary and community  groups for their work with disadvantaged children and young people. The 89 projects that are currently supp&shy;orted by  the fund represent a wide range of activities that span the business areas of  several Departments.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although my Department administers those funds, it is not solely a DHSSPS initiative. The funding  arrange&shy;ments to support the children&rsquo;s fund, reflect the cross-government  nature of the initiative.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">At the outset, the Executive made available &pound;17&middot;5 million  from Executive programme funds to support the children&rsquo;s fund over the four  years from April 2003 to March 2007. That funding was augmented from March 2007 by additional funds that were made available  by the then Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Mr Peter Hain when  he announced a children&rsquo;s and young people&rsquo;s funding package. All projects were  advised that funding would not continue beyond March 2008. That contrasts with  the voluntary and community sectors&rsquo;  commonly held view that the additional money was ring-fenced in the  children&rsquo;s and young people&rsquo;s funding  package to provide continuing support to groups that are working with  children and young people, including children&rsquo;s fund projects.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  is directly responsible for only 57 of the 89 projects that are currently  supported. The four Home-Start schemes are included among those 57 projects.  The other 32 projects are for other Ministers to consider. Members will be  aware of the inadequacy of next year&rsquo;s proposed Budget allocation for my  Department. As a result, I cannot guarantee that all existing projects will be  supported in future or to the level that they have been in the past. It will  simply not be possible to make firm decisions about individual projects until  consultation on the draft Budget has been completed and final decisions have  been taken.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the meantime, I have asked my officials to liaise with  the Department of Education, the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure and the Northern Ireland Office to see  whether they can assist with funding. I know how important it is that existing  projects are given early confirmation about their future funding. I assure  Members that that information will be forthcoming as soon as possible.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Home-Start fund  comes under the children&rsquo;s and young  people&rsquo;s funding package, which is being wound up next March. That is why we are in this situation. Four Home-Start schemes will be affected, one of which  is the Home-Start scheme in Ards,  Comber and the Peninsula; also affected are Home-Start schemes in  Armagh, Dungannon, Down district and Newry and Mourne.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  administered funds that were provided from the centre; however, from March 2008  there will be no money. My Department is trying to manage the future; we are  looking for funds. We should be able to manage until next year; after that,  however, there will be serious problems, and  we will not be able to manage. I am trying to look on the Home-Start  schemes as inescapables because they are ongoing and employ people. One simply  cannot tell people that the draft Budget has abolished their funding; there has  to be a period for a soft landing. I am trying to do that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Budget will abolish the children&rsquo;s and young people&rsquo;s  fund, and that is why we are in this situation. Members have heard me talk about the Budget and have heard me highlight the problems that I face with  it. It was not a joke; I was not playing politics; I was not trying to be clever or to wind anyone up; I was not trying to be difficult. I told the truth. The cuts in funding to Home-Start  schemes are one of the consequences &mdash; only one of them &mdash; of my Department&rsquo;s  Budget allocation, and it is small when compared to the list before me.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mrs Robinson &mdash; who is no longer in the Chamber &mdash; talked about efficiencies in the four health  and social services boards as a result of amalgamations. As far as jobs  saved are concerned, we have already reached the efficiencies for years 1 and  2. I have already said that I will reach the efficiencies on 3% CSR of &pound;343 million.  That will still not do it. Although &pound;450 million of new money is coming into  the health budget over three years, &pound;700,000 comes out of it in unavoidables  and inescapables.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I am left with only &pound;97 million over three years  for service developments, and those moneys  are to be found in the third year, as the efficiencies emerge. There is virtually nothing in year 1 and year 2. That is  the problem with which I am faced,  and that is why I am complaining. Despite accusations that I agreed to  the Budget, the fact is that I never agreed to it &mdash; I refused to agree to it, and the minutes of the Executive Committee meetings fully exonerate me. I will continue to argue that point.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members who talk about the draft Budget being a good Budget  for health &mdash; as some have &mdash; need to consider their position very carefully.  Every Member will be asked to make a decision about, and vote on, the draft  Budget. It will be at that point that push comes to shove, and Members will  have to justify to their constituents the consequences of agreeing to the  allocations. The end to funding for Home-Start is one such consequence, and let  me assure the Assembly that, as far as the  Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety is concerned, it  is one of the small consequences. There are bigger consequences to come.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mrs Robinson suggested at last Thursday&rsquo;s meeting of the  Health Committee that Belfast  had too many hospitals, and that hospital closures were the way to fix the  Health Service. That is not the way to do it. I am not up for shutting down  hospitals and cutting back on services. I am in favour of maintaining the  service as it is, because that is the service that the people of Northern Ireland  need, desire and require. However, as matters stand, if the Budget does not  change, the Home-Start scheme will be a casualty &mdash; and that is why I am arguing  for change.</p>
