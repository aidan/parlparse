    <p class="H4StageHeading">Commissioner for Older People Bill: Final Stage</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister) (Mr G Kelly)</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That the Commissioner for Older People Bill [NIA  21/09] do now pass.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased to speak in the Final Stage debate of the  Commissioner for Older People Bill. This is a momentous day for the Assembly,  on which it takes a significant step towards meeting the needs of older people,  a group that is highly valued by all Members, not least because some Members  are already part of that group, and a lot more of them are heading in that  direction.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Throughout this process, junior Minister Newton and I have  had the opportunity to meet with many older people individually and through  their organisations, and I continue to be impressed by the energy and passion  that they display when they get the opportunity to have their voices heard.  Older people here have made, and continue to make, significant contributions to  the quality of our lives and society.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, many older people are vulnerable members of  society, and their interests and rights must be actively protected and promoted.  In completing the Bill&rsquo;s passage through the Assembly today and, subsequently,  establishing a Commissioner for Older People, we will send out a clear message  that older people must not be sidelined or left in isolation and that their  needs must be met when services are being delivered and policies are being  developed and reviewed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the Programme for Government, the Executive committed to  providing a strong, independent voice for older people. That commitment was  made public on 18 December 2007, when the then First Minister, Ian Paisley, and  deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness, announced their intention to create a  Commissioner for Older People. In order to hear the views of older people,  their representative groups and existing statutory bodies on how best to make  that happen, we asked independent consultants to look at the case for, and the  potential roles and responsibilities of, an independent Commissioner for Older  People. In May 2008, the final report, which concluded that there was strong  support and a need for a Commissioner for Older People, was produced. The  report recommended that legislation be introduced to enable a commissioner with  a range of functions, powers and duties to be appointed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the development of legislation is a complicated and  lengthy process, the First Minister and deputy First Minister decided to  appoint an Older People&rsquo;s Advocate in the meantime, and Dame Joan Harbison was  appointed to that role on 1 December 2008. Her role is to keep Ministers  informed about older people&rsquo;s issues and to provide Ministers with analyses  based on the views of older people, and the voluntary and community sector, on  the impact and practical outcomes of the policies and strategies that are aimed  at older people. Her role is also to assist with the consultation on the draft  legislation and on the proposals for facilitating consultation events.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Dame Joan will continue with her work until a commissioner  has been appointed. I pay tribute to Dame Joan and to her team in the  advocate&rsquo;s office. Dame Joan has worked extremely hard, and she and her small  team have done an excellent job, including invaluable work on pension provision  and transport, of drawing attention to the issues of concern for older people,  Dame Joan regularly provided advice of the highest quality to Ministers, to the  Committee for the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister  (OFMDFM), and to officials in our Department who were carrying out the  consultation and developing the legislation. We are all in her debt. I do not  know whether she is here yet, but, thank you, Dame Joan. I also thank the Welsh  Older People&rsquo;s Commissioner, Ruth Marks, and her team who kindly shared their  knowledge, experience and expertise.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">After extensive research, the draft legislation and policy  proposals were developed in 2008 and 2009. That involved pre-consultation with  the Committee for the Office of First Minister and deputy First Minister and a  range of key stakeholders, including existing statutory and regulatory bodies,  Departments, the Age Sector Platform and the organisations that are now known  as Age NI. On 1 October 2009, we launched the public consultation on the draft  Bill and policy proposals to establish a Commissioner for Older People. That  consultation ran until 7 January 2010.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The events and the responses to the consultations made  clear that, across the board, there was strong interest in and support for the  policy and the need for a commissioner. In particular, we were pleased that a  significant number of older people took the trouble, during a week of very bad  weather, to come out to offer us their expertise and advice on the priorities  of a commissioner. Older people attended all public consultation events in  large numbers. They travelled to Stormont from all parts of the North to attend  meetings of the Committee for the Office of the First Minister and deputy First  Minister, which was considering the Bill, and they travelled again to attend  all key Assembly debates. We are grateful to Age NI and to the Age Sector  Platform for their assistance. I am also delighted that so many older people  are here with us today, especially with the weather conditions as they are, and  I look forward to meeting them shortly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This is a good day for older people, a Cheann Comhairle,  and a good day for us all. Following the consideration of the consultation  responses, we made a number of changes to the draft Bill. Most significantly,  strong representations were made by statutory organisations, trade unions,  health professionals, age representative groups and individual older people  that all nursing and residential care homes in the private and voluntary  sectors should be brought within the commissioner&rsquo;s remit, and we changed the draft  Bill to reflect that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We also listened to the many individuals and organisations  that called for the Commissioner for Older People to be able to commission  conciliation and mediation services. The Bill was amended to ensure that he or  she would have that new power and could, therefore, provide a cost-effective  alternative to what can be a lengthy process of legal proceedings. That power  can provide a speedy resolution to problems, which is often a critical factor  for older people.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On 24 May, following Executive agreement, the Bill was  introduced in the Assembly. On 7 June, it received wide and strong support  across the Assembly at its Second Stage, and o, and on 8 June, it commenced its  Committee Stage. The Committee for the Office of the First Minister and deputy  First Minister made a significant contribution to the development of the Bill,  and I thank all Committee members, including those who have since moved on to  other roles, for their work on the Bill. Committee members&rsquo; detailed  consideration of the Bill and their active engagement throughout the policy  development and legislative process should be recognised. I record our thanks  to them and to the Committee staff who supported them in their scrutiny.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I know that officials faced some tough questions in the  evidence sessions. Committee members expressed legitimate concerns about the  need to avoid any possible duplication of work by the commissioner with that of  other oversight bodies. We provided the Committee with a paper highlighting  issues that the commissioner could address and investigate, and the Committee  was satisfied that there was a need for a commissioner and a compelling need  for the investigatory powers outlined in the Bill. The Committee&rsquo;s consultation  on the Bill produced several high-quality papers and oral presentations from  consultees; I am grateful to them for their work.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Given the quality of their joint contribution to the  Committee, this is an appropriate point at which to offer my thanks to Age NI  and the Age Sector Platform. We are very grateful for the services that they  provide to older people across the North and for the work of their policy teams  throughout the Bill&rsquo;s progress and development. Their We Agree campaign  galvanised the debate on the case for a Commissioner for Older People.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As a result of the OFMDFM Committee&rsquo;s scrutiny of the Bill,  we proposed three amendments. In addition, we proposed three further amendments  on the advice of the Attorney General on issues of legislative competence, and  at Consideration Stage the Assembly voted that those amendments stand part of  the Bill. My colleagues and I are grateful for the support and the robust  challenge that the OFMDFM Committee, Assembly colleagues, the Executive, the  age sector and many older people have given to our proposals since the initial  consultation on the Bill and its subsequent progress. We feel that we now have  a much improved piece of legislation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The office of the Commissioner for Older People will be  unique: no single organisation will have the range of powers and functions of  the commissioner or be able to concentrate in an holistic and strategic manner  on the rights and interests of older people.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will reiterate why it is important that we establish an  office of Commissioner for Older People now. The most recent figures state that  28% of pensioners live in poverty and that no less than 50% of pensioners  suffer fuel poverty. A 2007-08 report stated that 62% of older people aged  between 65 and 74 reported having a long-standing illness. For those aged 75 and  older, the percentage increases to 67% for males and 72% for females, with the  figure of 38% for the population as a whole.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">What is more, older people represent an ever growing  percentage of our population. Estimates suggest that by 2041, 42% of the population  will be aged 50 or over; persons of pensionable age will represent 25% of our  population; and the percentage of those aged 75 and over will double, to at  least 14%. The recently published report by the Registrar General highlights  that, over the next five decades, our population is projected to age faster  than that of Scotland, England or Wales. By 2058, it is projected  that there will be at least 500,000 people here aged 65 and over. The report  also notes that although life expectancy has improved, only half of those aged  over 65 will remain in good health. That will have implications for the  provision of care and other services.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Given those facts and projections and the absence of a body  with a specific focus on the interests and rights of older people, we are  determined to proceed with the appointment of the commissioner. We are also  determined that the commissioner will have the necessary powers and resources  to promote and safeguard the interests and rights of older people.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are taking this measure forward at a time of financial  constraints, and Members have, rightly, drawn attention to the need to ensure  value for money. The Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister  shares that view and will ensure that all public services are delivered as  efficiently and effectively as possible. We are critically examining all  aspects of our Department&rsquo;s expenditure, including funding for sponsored public  bodies and the potential for reducing costs through the sharing of resources,  where appropriate, among sponsor bodies.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, I share the view that several Committee members  expressed during Consideration Stage that establishing an office for a  Commissioner for Older People is something that we cannot afford not to do.  Indeed, it could lead to considerable savings for the public purse.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">10.45 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The commissioner will be proactive in ensuring early  intervention when needs arise, rather than later in the process when costs can  be greater. By bringing forward the legislation and establishing the Commissioner  for Older People now, we are taking a strategic and long-term view of the  issues of an ageing population and ensuring that there is a dedicated focal  point for older people and that older people here have the strong, independent  voice and protection that they deserve. Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann  Comhairle.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for the Office of the First Minister and deputy  First Minister (Dr Farry)</strong>: On behalf of the Committee for the Office of the  First Minister and deputy First Minister, I thank junior Minister Kelly for  moving the Final Stage of the Commissioner for Older People Bill. In addition,  I acknowledge the very important role played by the Department, at ministerial  level and by officials, in getting the legislation to this stage. This area has  been of long-standing interest among MLAs and, indeed, a long-standing  commitment of the Assembly, so I am sure that everyone is pleased that we are  at the Final Stage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As everyone is aware, research shows that older people  represent a growing percentage of our population. Estimates suggest that, by  2041, 42% of our population will be over 50, 25% will be of pensionable age &mdash;  whatever age that might be &mdash; and 14% will be 75 or over. The Bill will provide  for a Commissioner for Older People, who will ensure that older people&rsquo;s voices  are heard and that there is a positive attitude to older people and a  co-ordinated and holistic approach to matters that affect older people&rsquo;s lives.  The commissioner will be able to investigate complaints made by older people  against relevant authorities and to conduct formal investigations into the  actions of relevant authorities as defined in schedule 3.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">During its scrutiny of the Bill, the Committee considered  in detail the issue of investigatory powers, and, during evidence sessions with  stakeholders and the Department, sought to ensure that the scope and possible  remit for the commissioner will be large enough and cover areas that other  investigatory bodies do not cover. The Committee was briefed by officials on  potential gaps in investigatory powers; the areas into which the Commissioner  for Older People&rsquo;s powers will extend; and what the commissioner will be able  to investigate. During that briefing, the Committee was advised that there were  still many areas affecting older people&rsquo;s lives directly where no statutory  organisation had the power to act. In addition, the Committee received a  briefing paper highlighting 29 possible areas in which the Commissioner for  Older People could investigate and providing a number of real-life examples of  where the commissioner could have been involved.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee also received an assurance from the  Department that the residual clauses place limits on the powers of the  commissioner and ensure that, where an existing body already has responsibility  for a statutory complaints process, the commissioner cannot investigate. That  avoids situations in which two publicly funded organisations might be involved  in the same case. The Committee was content that the powers in the Bill were  appropriate, and, therefore, it strongly supports the Bill and welcomes the  progress made.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At this stage, Mr Speaker, I shall make a few comments on  behalf of me and my party. I acknowledge and respect Dame Joan Harbison&rsquo;s  pioneering actions in respect of older persons&rsquo; issues and her role as their  advocate, which the junior Minister outlined. In addition, I acknowledge and  respect the level of interest and support from Age Sector Platform and Age NI  when lobbying for the Bill. Furthermore, as we enter the halfway point of the  final year of this Assembly&rsquo;s mandate, it is worth acknowledging civil  society&rsquo;s substantially increased level of sophistication when interacting with  the Assembly. What has happened in and around the Bill is a very good example  of that growing awareness and interest and of the ability to influence how  decisions are taken. All that certainly stands to the betterment of society.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Like the junior Minister, I am conscious of the range of  issues that older persons face in this society. However, it is also important  that we do not view older people simply as people with problems to be  addressed. In fact, we should regard them as people with a continuing  contribution to make to society, whether through the community and voluntary sector,  continuing to work or the family role that some people play as carers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That said, we have to acknowledge acute issues such as fuel  poverty, deprivation, loneliness and a range of health issues and the  importance of good inter-generational respect and understanding. It is worth  stressing again that there is very strong evidence to suggest that  socio-economic circumstances have a major impact on life expectancy for older  people. We need to be conscious of that and take action on it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Concern has been raised about the cost of creating the  post, and we must be conscious of that in the current financial circumstances.  I was pleased that junior Minister Kelly stressed that it can be viewed as an  important investment in our society, and that not to do it would be a false  economy. An older person&rsquo;s commissioner&rsquo;s office, with proper teeth and the  ability to influence government and point out where government needs to correct  things, will be a much more efficient and effective use of the scarce resources  available to us. The Government can save more money if they can move more  quickly to address issues that arise, rather than leaving problems to fester.  If we have to intervene later in the day, the statutory obligations that will  have to be met will, inevitably, incur further costs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The creation of the post of older people&rsquo;s commissioner is  an important step towards facilitating a more efficient and effective use of  resources that will not be an additional burden on the public purse. I  appreciate that there are concerns about the creation of another body at a time  when people are talking about the need for rationalisation in government. It is  important that we give the older person&rsquo;s commissioner the chance to prove the  new body&rsquo;s relevance to society unencumbered for at least a number of years.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Having said that, there may well be a time when we will  have to look at how we rationalise the various existing investigatory bodies;  and it is important to make a couple of points in that regard. First, issues  relating to older people will be with us forever, and, as the demographic  balance of society changes, the relevance of those issues will become a lot  clearer. The need for a body with teeth must be part and parcel of that. If  there is to be some rationalisation, it is important that the Assembly makes it  clear that there should be no diminution of the powers and responsibilities of  the older person&rsquo;s commissioner&rsquo;s functions, even if the body ends up in a new  institutional structure in the future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We must protect the body and ensure that it can deal with  the issues. I do not envisage having to face that situation for some time, but  it is important to put down markers today about how we see the future of the  body unfolding. This is a day to be welcomed, and the vast numbers of older  people in our society who have shown interest in the issue will also welcome  it. I look forward to seeing the progress of this new function over the months  and years to come, and I hope that it sparks real change in the way in which  government interacts with senior citizens in this society. It is fundamentally  about respect, understanding, giving people opportunities and addressing real  needs where they exist.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>:  My party welcomes the Final Stage of this very important piece of legislation.  It has been in development for over three years, and we are pleased at the  level of input from more than 400 older people, as well as 10 written evidence  submissions to the Committee for the Office of the First Minister and deputy  First Minister and oral evidence submissions from five organisations. The We  Agree campaign&rsquo;s aim and objectives have been supported by approximately 2,500  people and 120 organisations. This is a prime example of how devolution is  working for the people of Northern    Ireland, because it shows that local people  are influencing local legislation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That is to be welcomed, and I am pleased that the  legislation is coming into its final stages and will put the new commissioner  in place. Imagine how long the process would have taken under direct rule; it  does not bear thinking about.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It has been said that, over the next 15 years, one quarter  of our population will be over the age of 60. That is proportionally higher  than anywhere else in the United    Kingdom. It is, therefore, essential that we  build a framework in our society whereby older people can continue to  participate in employment and have access to benefits such as pension credit  and access to further and higher education. My staff in my constituency office  work hard to ensure that older people who come in receive all the benefits to  which they are entitled. More often than not, older people are not aware of  what they can claim, and the Commissioner for Older People can and will ensure  that the level of benefit take-up is increased.</p>
    <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [MrMcClarty] in the Chair)</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In these difficult economic times, many people may question  the cost and value of another commissioner, especially when there has been much  discussion on the number of quangos and arm&rsquo;s-length bodies that already exist  in Northern Ireland.  However, according to figures released by Age Northern Ireland, the estimated  annual cost is &pound;1&middot;5 million. Considering that there are 290,000 older people in  Northern Ireland,  the cost is less than 2p per older person per day. That is a small price to pay  and is excellent value not just for the older population but for all of us as  we age. Improving the position of older people will deliver better outcomes for  us all now and in the future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Age Northern    Ireland and other voluntary sector  organisations receive thousands of calls every year and often tackle the same  problems over and over again. The commissioner will be able to tackle the root  cause of such problems by using powers of investigation and review. Common  issues can be resolved more efficiently by the commissioner making  recommendations on policy and practice that, in turn, will be implemented by  the various relevant agencies. The commissioner could have a duty to engage  older people and thus give them an opportunity to contribute to the process.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said earlier, it is highly unlikely that we would be  at this point if we did not have a devolved Government through which people  have the power to shape and influence policy and decision-making. Age Northern  Ireland has given some examples of situations where it would be appropriate for  an older person&rsquo;s commissioner to step in, such as: access to transport, where  people are entitled to free bus passes but where there is inconsistent  provision of rural and community transport; lack of benefit take-up, where  there is potential for improvement if automatic payments of pension credit are  introduced; the withdrawal of age-based concessionary fees in employment and  learning would be another major step forward; variation in nutritional  standards for meals on wheels; and the malnutrition of older people in  hospitals.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When I last spoke during a debate on the Commissioner for  Older People Bill, I highlighted that I had recently been in and out of  hospital on a regular basis to visit someone close to me. I have seen older  people being left with food in front of them, and they have not been encouraged  to eat that food. The commissioner will be able to tackle those sorts of issues  and highlight the problems that exist, and will continue to exist, in a very  busy Health Service in which, for instance, old people need encouragement to  take food that is set down in front of them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The issues that I mentioned are very serious, and, when Northern Ireland  has its own Commissioner for Older People, he or she will be able to tackle the  problems faced by older people today and plan ahead so that future generations  of older people will enjoy an even better quality of life.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.00 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Before I close, I want to pay tribute to Dame Joan  Harbison, the interim commissioner, for all her hard work &mdash; and she did work  extremely hard. I do not have the same consideration for some commissioners,  but Dame Joan attended meetings the length and breadth of the Province. All of  us are indebted to you, Dame Joan, for the real commitment and dedication that  you gave as interim commissioner. The DUP wants to thank you for all that you  have done. You never gave up on that very valid case and kept presenting it,  and that bore fruit in the Committee and, indeed, in consultations with the  Ministers, which you did regularly. Well done, and thank you for that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. Will the Member please refer all remarks through the Chair?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>: I  have no problem, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am sure that the Chair will agree that  Dame Joan has done a wonderful job. It is my pleasure and that of my party to  support the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms M Anderson</strong>: &Eacute;ir&iacute;m le  taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt don Bhille. I am delighted to be here to support the  Bill, particularly as a member of the Committee for the Office of the First  Minister and deputy First Minister. The Committee engaged with the sectors and  with the different phases of the Bill as it came through the Committee. There  are plenty of examples that make the Bill worthwhile and show how much the  Commissioner for Older People is needed. Indeed, the Minister has highlighted  some of those, as have others, particularly Jimmy Spratt, who is also a member  of the Committee. Other members of the Committee who have since left played a  sterling role when we were going through the phases of engaging with the sector  and ensuring that we got the best possible Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Around 18 months ago, many of us heard of a 69-year-old man  who, allegedly, was refused treatment in a brain injury unit in the North  because of the hospital&rsquo;s policy of not treating anyone with such an injury  over the age of 60. At that time, no existing body had the power to intervene,  but, if there had been an older people&rsquo;s commissioner at that time, she or he  could have stepped in to review the adequacy and effectiveness of the services  that were provided to older people. For instance, she or he would have been  able to undertake a systemic review of the arbitrary age-based barriers, which  no other body can currently do. That case definitely adds weight to reviews and  evidence that have been presented before us all showing that older people may  be being denied treatment that is offered to younger patients. That is an  alarming concern that we all have in the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have also heard that, in some hospitals, the standards  of hygiene and nutrition for older people fall well below the minimum  standards. Last July, we heard and saw that some older patients were  malnourished because they were unable to eat the food provided. Every one of us  will agree that that is an absolute shame, because some of those matters can be  fixed so simply. For instance, non-pureed food can be given to patients with  swallowing difficulties, and it takes seconds to perform that task. Food trays  can be moved up instead of being placed at the end of the bed. Trays have been  left out of reach and no help or encouragement given to people to eat. Food  trays were left untouched with no questions asked or remedial action taken.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The commissioner will be alert to issues that affect older  people. She or he will be able to conduct a holistic review where those issues might  get lost among the pressures and priorities of other bodies. As Minister Kelly  said, the Commissioner for Older People will be like no other body.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In previous debates, the Assembly discussed how various  agencies must work together, rather than duplicate one another&rsquo;s work.  Nutrition is a good example of an area where collaboration between the  Commissioner for Older People and the Regulation and Quality Improvement  Authority (RQIA) might have identified and remedied the problem at an earlier  stage. Together, bodies complement each other and add value to their work. They  can integrate the perspective of older people&rsquo;s rights and needs into an  overarching approach to improving standards. They can undertake joint reviews  or use evidence gathered through the commissioner&rsquo;s special expertise on older  people to inform the RQIA&rsquo;s recommendations on standards. In fact, together the  RQIA and the Commissioner for Older People offer the possibility to close a gap  in health and personal social services for older people.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We in the Chamber and others have heard in the media about  confusion over the application of the Bill to people who are aged 50 and over.  It is important to be clear that, in fact, the Bill applies mainly to people  aged 60 and over. That said, the commissioner may, in certain circumstances  only, pursue a matter that concerns someone who is aged 50 or over, where a  matter of principle is concerned, as well as in exceptional circumstances.  Those provisions are sensible. For some people with a lower life expectancy, such  as Travellers, 50 may be equivalent to 60 for the rest of us. Being able to  pursue a matter of principle will also be one means of future-proofing; it will  allow the commissioner to tackle a fundamental issue earlier and prevent a  worse problem in later years.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The commissioner will have authority under the Bill to  safeguard and promote older people&rsquo;s rights and interests. I welcome the  commissioner&rsquo;s powers to issue guidance on best practice, conduct  investigations and make representations and recommendations:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;to any body or person about any matter concerning the  interests of older persons.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is to be welcomed. We absolutely need a  champion with strong powers who will prioritise older people and achieve  solutions on their behalf. It is important that the commissioner has powers not  only to assist older people to take complaints and in legal proceedings but to  conduct formal investigations and to require information on the implementation  of any recommendation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">All agree that the Bill has, undoubtedly, been improved  with the amendments that we made in the Chamber in November. Unquestionably,  several of those amendments were made at the suggestion of the age sector and  the interim advocate. Junior Minister Newton, who spoke that day, told the  House that the sole purpose of any restriction under clause 8(2)(b) is to avoid  duplication with the work of other bodies and that it is not intended to stymie  the commissioner in carrying out his or her key functions. There is the  possibility for amendments in the future, should that prove to be an  impediment. The junior Minister also added other relevant authorities to the  list. He said that that could be done if it became apparent that it was  necessary to do so. Therefore, every effort has, undoubtedly, been made to  ensure that the commissioner is a strong, independent voice for older people,  and rightly so. No single organisation in the North has the range of powers and  functions that the Commissioner for Older People will have.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The commissioner will bring together expertise and focus to  protect and enhance older people&rsquo;s rights and interests in the widest sense. As  I have said, those powers and duties will add value to existing bodies and  arrangements. The commissioner will help us all to take a longer-term view of  ageing, which will benefit older people now and, undoubtedly, as Minister Kelly  said, the rest of us in the future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am delighted to support the Bill, and I pay tribute to  the participatory democracy that we saw at work. The age sector and the Older  People&rsquo;s Advocate came to the Committee, together with trade unions and others,  and strengthened the Bill by suggesting some of the amendments that were  discussed by the House in November. I am proud to have had the privilege of  working with those in the age sector who engaged with MLAs to strengthen the  Bill and make it the best Bill possible.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I pay tribute to the OFMDFM Committee staff, who assisted  Committee members greatly as the Bill progressed. I also pay tribute to my  colleagues for the debates and discussions that we had in Committee. At least,  the sector will find itself with a Bill that it believes will address the needs  of many people we know, some of whom are in our own families and whom we love  dearly. Hopefully, those people will benefit from having a Commissioner for  Older People.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  I congratulate the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister on  progressing the Bill to its Final Stage. I apologise on behalf of my party  leader and the Chairperson of the Committee for the Office of the First  Minister and deputy First Minister, Tom Elliott, for his absence. I know that  he would also acknowledge all the hard work that has been done by Dame Joan  Harbison and the representative groups.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On a personal note, as a reasonably new boy in the Chamber  and a very new Committee member, I must say how impressed I was in all my  meetings with the various groups in south Antrim and by all the hard work that  they do for themselves and others. It was great fun meeting them and listening  to them. They always conduct their work with a bit of mirth, and I enjoyed it  all. They are an example to us all.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill will address two key matters. First, it will allow  for the promotion of the full participation of older people in our society. We  must ensure that all people have the opportunity to fully engage and  participate in society, their local community, work and family life,  irrespective of their age. An advocate for older people will facilitate that  necessary goal. We must ensure that people have the opportunity to take part  and make a contribution. We must also recognise that every citizen should be  respected and have their viewpoint promoted.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The second thing that the Bill will achieve is the better  protection of some of the most vulnerable people in our society. Other Members  have quoted the statistics; I will not go into them again. Whether it is  poverty, fear of crime, understanding care needs, getting payments that are due  or mediating or investigating disputes, the statistics show that infinitely better  representation of older people is needed and needed now. The weather that we  are all facing brings home the reality that many older people are unable to  heat their home, get out to shop for necessities or have significant contact  with other people in their community. A commissioner working as an advocate for  older people will raise the profile of those issues and hopefully enable  swifter resolutions by working with the Assembly, local authorities and the  voluntary and community sector. Indeed, being swift and dynamic is essential,  as is the commissioner having effective teeth at all times, rather than being,  as it has been put, a &ldquo;toothless tiger&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the Bill passed through its stages, the Ulster Unionist  Party raised a number of concerns, which it still has. There is a danger that  the investigatory role of the Commissioner for Older People will overlap and  duplicate the role of the Northern Ireland Ombudsman and a number of our  existing commissions. In these times of fiscal constraint, it is crucial that  all resources go to front line services and to those who are most in need. We  must minimise duplication and inefficiency. It is for that reason that we  should take great care as we proceed with the setting up of the office of the  Commissioner for Older People to make it as efficient and effective as  possible. We should not shy away from reviewing its practices as we go forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Unionist Party, having noted its limited  concerns, is happy to support the Bill. We look forward to working with whomever  is appointed as the Commissioner for Older People to promote the rights and  needs of people who play such an invaluable role in our society. My party and I  support the Bill.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.15 am</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  I, too, welcome the Bill. It has been talked about since I first came here as  an elected Member, and I am delighted that it has come to fruition for older  people.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Throughout the debates, the SDLP made its reservations  about the Bill clear. That was not to undermine the post of the commissioner  but because we want to see a powerful, effective commissioner acting for older  people and not one whose powers are restricted through all manner of  constraints. We want the commissioner to act when another body fails to do so  and when action ought to be taken. However, we want the commissioner not to act  if he believes that the case has merit, would be unfair to older people and  would undermine the role and authority of the commissioner.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Many older people depend heavily on the social care system,  which should provide quality of care in a fair, equitable and sustainable way.  Some carers are also elderly. Let us remind ourselves of the amount of money  that carers save us each year. I think that it is about &pound;3 billion, which is  quite an amount of money that older people save for us. That is not to mention  their voluntary work and taking care of their grandchildren. They are to be  congratulated on their lifestyles. I am proud to be the spokesperson for older  people, since I am one myself.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Budget may be under pressure in the present economic  climate, but we have a moral responsibility not to let the burden fall unfairly  on the vulnerable. We can choose to use resources more effectively to promote  the health and well-being of older people, and the Commissioner for Older  People can more effectively bring older people and their views into the debate,  to assist, plan and target resources.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I urge the relevant authorities to be responsive to the  commissioner&rsquo;s approaches and recommend&shy;ations, and I urge other commissions  and bodies to collaborate with the Commissioner for Older People. We want to  see solid memor&shy;andums of understanding between commissioners so that they can  deliver properly for older people.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Bill and am glad that it is before the House  before Christmas. May I, through you Mr Deputy Speaker, pay tribute to Dame  Joan Harbison on her good work over the months that she has been in post? I  also congratulate those who work with older people, all year, every year. I  hope that the Bill will be successful and that older people will get more care  from it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Humphrey</strong>:  I support the passage of the Commissioner for Older People Bill. The creation  of an office to advance and protect the interests of older people is long  overdue, and it is likely to prove to be one of the most important achievements  of the Northern Ireland Assembly to date.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Given its significance to my North   Belfast constituency, I must mention a number of statistics. North  Belfast has the third largest population of over-60s of all Northern Ireland  constituencies. Obscenely, all those people can expect to die up to 10 years  earlier than folk in other constituencies. They are also much more likely to  suffer a limiting long-term illness in their latter years. So, how we treat  older people and address their needs is of enormous importance to me and to the  people I represent.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">All of us are all too well aware of the political power  wielded by older people when they are so minded. Our surgeries and postbags are  a testament to that. There is also a confident lobby of older people, organised  by dedicated local voluntary organisations, such as those that came together to  establish the older people&rsquo;s platform for Northern Ireland. Their support for  this legislation should be instructive for all Members.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The irony is that, although older people are among some of  the strongest in our community, many are among the most vulnerable. The  infirmity of old age can render previously independent individuals reliant on  the support of others to meet even the most basic of personal needs. It is at  that time that the principles of independence, participation, care,  self-fulfilment and dignity, which are enshrined in the commissioner&rsquo;s role,  are at their most important. With that in mind, I am particularly pleased that  Ministers have taken on board the concerns expressed by a variety of  stakeholders during the consultations and have widened the commissioner&rsquo;s remit  to encompass the protection of all residents of nursing homes and residential  homes, including those who pay for their care. It is critically important that  no older person is allowed to fall through the net. I also welcome the  reassurance from Ministers that administrative muddle will be avoided while maximum  protection is provided to older people. The promise of regular reviews of  co-operation by the Commissioner for Older People will also be important in  that regard.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that, while recognising the important role  that the commissioner will play in addressing and preventing the inappropriate  treatment of senior citizens, we do not lose sight of the equally important  role that the office will have in positively promoting the role of older people  in our society. It would be to the great disadvantage of Northern Ireland  if we were to overlook the enormous contribution older people can and do make  to our families and communities throughout the country. Whether as carers  ensuring that young parents can be economically active or as trainers who can pass  on workplace knowledge and skills built up over the decades, older people have  a huge amount to give.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Increasingly, older people will be required to remain  economically active, and it will be important for us to ensure that the right  approaches are put in place to ensure that future generations do not find  themselves faced with an old age lived in poverty. It is also easy to  underestimate the importance of older people in our community, and it must be  remembered that they represent a growing proportion of our population. If older  people are in our communities, our communities are much richer; if they are  not, communities are the poorer for that. It is important that vital facilities  and services are sustained at a level that ensures the dignity of the older  people in our community.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Whether the issue is employment, housing, health,  education, crime or community safety, we have to understand that all  Departments have a role to play. We have to understand that the impact of an  ageing population is one of the biggest issues facing Northern Ireland  in the twenty-first century. I too, on behalf of those of us on these Benches,  commend the interim commissioner and Older People&rsquo;s Advocate, Dame Joan  Harbison, for her role in the formation of the Bill. As we move forward, the  role of the Commissioner for Older People in making sure that we have a  coherent approach to those matters will be of huge importance. The passage of  the Bill represents an enormous first step, not only for older people but for  all of us, and I commend the Bill to the House.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I too welcome and support the Bill. I  read a piece in &lsquo;The Irish News&rsquo; on 4 December by a journalist whose comments  sum up the lack of understanding of why a Commissioner for Older People is  required. Having unnecessarily attacked the Age Sector Platform and taken a  cheap shot at it, he spoke about the creation of a quango &mdash; his word, not mine.  He then referred to the potential cost of the Commissioner for Older People and  stated that the approximately &pound;2 million that it will cost:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;would cover 8,000 cold weather fuel payments, 5,000  full tanks of heating oil or a month&rsquo;s electricity for 40,000 households.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Although I cannot argue about his grasp of  mathematics, I can certainly argue about his attitude to the Commissioner for  Older People. He went on to refer to:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the pointlessness of the Older Person&rsquo;s  Commissioner&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Again, those are his words, not mine. He also  stated that:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;benefits are set in London and even the whole of Stormont cannot  lobby to change them.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The creation of the commissioner is not just about money;  it is about giving older people a strong and effective voice in our society and  giving them the opportunity to be included in policy decisions that directly affect  them. It is about recognising their contribution to society and not continuing  to make them feel marginalised and isolated. Benefits were mentioned, and  almost &pound;2 million is unclaimed weekly in pension credits, which needs to be  urgently addressed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Interestingly, I listened to the radio this morning and  heard discussion of the Budget that is coming down the line in the Twenty-six  Counties. The point was made that pensions in the South, which will not be  affected by the Budget, are almost twice as high as those in the North, and  that in an economy that is, apparently, bankrupt.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At Further Consideration Stage, I referred to the number of  people over 50 years of age in the North who are economically active. That is  expected to rise by some 30,000 or 50,000 by 2020. As Members heard, a large  proportion of them will be over 60, and we must move quickly to bring their  rights in line with those of others by removing the default retirement age in  our employment regulations. Research by Age UK shows that 100,000 people were  forced to retire in 2009 alone. With the change in the economic climate, many  older people will need or wish to work after age 65, and they should not be  denied the opportunity to benefit from working if they are able to do so.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The National Institute of Economic and Social Research has  estimated that extending the average working life by one effective year could  increase GDP by around 1%. We should not fear that that will necessarily  displace younger workers. One economic commentator who was concerned about the  impact of the minimum wage on employment admitted recently that the biggest job  increases in Britain  came in the period when the minimum wage rose most, probably because of the  economic regeneration that comes with extra spending power. Putting extra  spending power in the pockets of older people will also help regeneration and  employment. While the Equality Commission has a lead role in employment  matters, it should work alongside the Commissioner for Older People, who will  play the leading role in changing how we view ageing and, I hope, start the  cultural change that will get rid of outdated custom and practice.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We must recognise and value the continuing contribution  that older people make to society as employers and employees, as well as  mentors, carers, volunteers and grandparents. Two fifths of single pensioners  and one fifth of pensioner couples have no income other than the state  retirement pension and state benefits. These proportions are more than double  those in Britain.  We know that we have a higher proportion of older people living in poverty and  that only 19% of those are receiving pension credit. Older people can be  unaware of what they are entitled to &mdash; that has already been mentioned. They  can find the claims system complicated. Some shy away from claiming, not  appreciating that it is simply what they are due. If they received their full  benefits, there would also be some positive knock-on effect for the economy. A  Commissioner for Older People could examine deficits in that area and add  authority to the case for introducing automatic payment of benefits. I am sure  that the Northern and Welsh commissioners will find common cause in this and  other matters at Westminster.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The very state of the economy and public finances, with the  surrounding pressures to reduce services and restrict access, offers the best  reason for the appointment of a Commissioner for Older People. The future must  look difficult and worrying from where older people stand. They need not just a  champion but someone who will work tirelessly to see that their interests are  protected and their rights extended and applied. I want to see an effective  commissioner with strong powers, someone who will not stand back from  exercising the powers of the office over relevant authorities and bodies  &mdash;public, private or voluntary agencies &mdash; where that is necessary and who will  keep MLAs informed and tell us how legislation can be improved and advise us on  what more can be done. Older people need to be and should be involved in the  commissioner&rsquo;s appointment, and I urge Ministers to allocate sufficient  resources for the job ahead and move forward quickly with the appointment. I  also pay tribute to Age NI, the Age Sector Platform and Joan Harbison for the  work that they have done and continue to do to promote the rights of older  people.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bresland</strong>:  I begin by declaring an interest: I am officially an older person. Even if I  were not, I would have no hesitation in supporting the Bill. It is very  welcome, as the former First Minister, Lord Bannside, said when the  announcement was made about the establishment of a Commissioner for Older  People. Our hope is that the commissioner will provide older people with a  strong and confident voice. This Bill will do that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It can be argued that we have enough commissioners of one  sort or another, but this Bill addresses a significant section of society. We  have a growing population of older people, and we welcome that. Older people  add something to society. They have wisdom and experience. In their day they  played their part. They worked hard, reared families and struggled with the  pressures of life. We owe it to them to ensure that they enjoy a high quality  of life in old age.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.30 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That presents us with some bigger challenges. I  often hear from older constituents that they feel as though they are less  important than young people and that they are made to feel as though they are a  burden to society. That ought not to be. The setting up of a Commissioner for  Older People should make a big difference.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that the new office is run as efficiently  as possible. I strongly urge the use of shared resources and a close link with  older people&rsquo;s commissioners in the rest of the UK. I support the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  At this stage, there is not much left to say about welcoming the Bill, except,  of course, that all Members share one common ambition, which is to live to be  old ourselves. Therefore, it is important to get the services right. I hope  that the work of the commissioner will ensure that the service delivery is  right and meaningful for the people whom the commissioner is charged to  represent.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I listened carefully to the contributions made by other  Members. Quite frankly, as a former health and social care worker, I was  appalled at some of the lists that were given of work that the commissioner  would have to be seen to challenge. Basic nutritional care is basic nursing  care. Unfortunately, it seems that some of our health and social care  professionals, for whatever reason, have travelled far from the delivery of the  most basic service provision, which is ensuring that people have a good and  proper diet. It is most regrettable. There may be myriad reasons why that has  happened. Obviously, it is the responsibility, not only of the charge nurse,  ward manager or residential care worker, but the regulatory authorities, in  particular the health and social care inspectorate. To ensure that scant  resources are not targeted at areas that are the responsibility of other  professionals or, indeed, inspection authorities, it is necessary to ensure  that, from the outset, it is clearly distinguished when the commissioner should  and must get involved.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Many people, in many senses, relished the challenge of  getting the Bill before the House. There was a great campaign, and I pay  tribute to those who took part in it. I also pay tribute to my fellow members  of the Committee for the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister  for their hard work over the past two years in hearing evidence and examining  the Bill. However, the challenge now is whether there will be sufficient money  in the budget in the coming years to ensure that the commissioner&rsquo;s office is  well resourced and that it has the money behind it to do the job that is  required of the commissioner. That is a challenge that we will, I hope, know  more about over the next few weeks. I am sure that we will all have views on  that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  This is an excellent morning. It is a brilliant morning. It is a morning on  which I, as a Member of the Northern Ireland Assembly, am proud to stand in the  Chamber. When something exciting happens in Northern Ireland, our chant is,  &ldquo;Hip hip hooray!&rdquo; So, this morning, on behalf of thousands of senior citizens,  I say, &ldquo;Hip hip hooray!&rdquo; that we have reached the Final Stage of the  Commissioner for Older People Bill. It has been a long time coming, but we are  here, and I fully support the Final Stage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I remember when, shortly after the Northern Ireland  Assembly was set up in 1998, I was chairperson of the age sector reference  group, as it was called then. People such as David McConnell, Bob Gibson, Tom  Cairns, Paddy Joe McClean and other  representatives from all over Northern Ireland met up here to campaign for the  needs of older people, including the need for a commissioner with full  legislative powers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At that time, I was only a junior. I now have to declare an  interest as being in the senior bracket, but I am not ashamed of that. I am  proud to be a senior and have much to offer the community that I serve.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am extremely happy to see this day. As a result of local  devolution, the Age Sector Platform, as it is now called, Age NI and others  have already seen valuable improvements in issues that we set out to achieve in  1998.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I pay tribute to everyone who campaigned, including, as has  been said, Dame Joan Harbison, who has been to the forefront of the campaign,  and all my Assembly colleagues, who listened to the people who marched up and  down. I am proud to see senior citizens from County  Down and County Fermanagh  on the We Agree campaign postcard. I also see Tom Elliott in the middle of that  picture. Tom is not a senior citizen, but there he is, with all the others,  supporting the We Agree campaign. I pay tribute to all who were involved in  that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Other people and I fully support the recent We Agree  campaign. Hundreds of senior citizens went onto the streets, came up to  Stormont, wrote to the Committee and did almost everything that they could to  convince the Department of the need for a good, strong, independent  commissioner with sufficient powers to protect the interests of our senior  citizens.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As has been said, the commissioner needs to have powers to  keep legislation, policy and practice under review; to mediate when disputes  arise; to investigate and undertake casework; to respond to approaches from  senior citizens; and to resolve all issues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The We Agree campaign produced a strong document, of which  I have a copy here, supporting the need for a Commissioner for Older People.  That document contains 30 recommendations, all of which, in my opinion, are  achievable. I appeal to the Office of the First Minister and deputy First  Minister to get to work on those recommendations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Much more could be said in support of the Bill in its Final  Stage. However, I conclude by saying well done to everyone, including the  Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister, which is represented  today by the junior Ministers. The Alliance Party fully supports the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  I concur with all my colleagues in welcoming the Bill&rsquo;s coming to fruition. As  my colleague Jimmy Spratt said, that is testimony to our devolved Government  here in Stormont, the Committee for the Office of the First Minister and deputy  First Minister, the Committee staff and the Ministers who worked so tirelessly  to deliver the Bill. We all have a duty to our elderly people, who,  particularly at this time of year, require so much more extra heating, food on  the table and a safe environment in which to live. We feel that the  commissioner designate must have as much power as possible to ensure that the  new office has control over older people&rsquo;s welfare.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, I pay tribute to the interim commissioner,  Dame Joan Harbison, for the excellent job that she has done for our elderly  people. I welcome all the senior citizens who have come to the Public Gallery  today even though the weather is so severe.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister) (Mr Newton)</strong>:  I convey my thanks to everyone who contributed to today&rsquo;s debate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I was in the Great Hall earlier, where the members of the  public who now fill the Public Gallery were gathering. They challenged me, to  some extent, to declare an interest in the matter, as I did during the consultation  meetings that were held around the country. Along with Mr Bresland and others,  I declare an interest.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Like Minister Kelly, I, too, am delighted that we are here  today debating the Final Stage of this groundbreaking piece of legislation,  which will lead to the establishment of a Commissioner for Older People, who  will make a real contribution to promoting and protecting the interests and  rights of older people in Northern    Ireland. Kieran McCarthy said that it is a  good day. It is a good news day. That is the truth of the matter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Stephen Farry and Dolores Kelly said that we all recognise  that there is an ageing population, and it is an issue that we cannot ignore.  That applies not just here but right across the UK and wider afield. Declining  birth rates and increased life expectancy will place an ever-increasing burden  on our resources and will present new challenges in how we address the needs  and concerns of older people.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Our commitment in the Programme for Government to provide a  strong, independent voice for older people was an early recognition by the  Executive that we need to be at the forefront of action worldwide to begin  providing a new and alternative way for older people to express their concerns  about how society views and treats them. Providing such a mechanism for older  people to articulate concerns was one aspect of a two-pronged approach that  seeks to provide a powerful public voice, whereby those concerns can be  addressed by an independent commissioner who will be able to articulate views  at the very highest level of government, and to take action on behalf of older  people&rsquo;s interests.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Throughout the process, I have had the opportunity to meet  many people and organisations who have been campaigning, and I attended and  spoke at several public consultation meetings. I want to reiterate what many  Members have said today, which is how impressed we have been, and continue to  be, with the energy and passion displayed by older people when they get an  opportunity to have their voices heard.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">By establishing a commissioner here, we will provide  another strong voice. It is a groundbreaking development, and I have no shame  about using that term again. With the exception of Wales, no other European country  has a commissioner of this type. As my party colleague Mr Spratt said, this is  a landmark piece of legislation that the Assembly has brought forward, and it  is an example of a local Assembly responding to the needs of local people.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will now touch on a number of points that were raised  during today&rsquo;s debate and earlier debates and will seek to address quickly some  of the questions raised.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Minister Kelly pointed out in his speech the concern about  the potential duplication of work of the commissioner with that of other  oversight bodies. That issue was raised during the Committee&rsquo;s scrutiny of the  Bill, and Mr Kinahan mentioned it today. In developing a case for a  commissioner, we commissioned a report from Deloitte, the consultancy  organisation. In its final report, it examined the potential costs of  establishing a commissioner, based on a wide range of issues. Deloitte  estimated that the initial set-up costs would be approximately &pound;500,000, with a  budget anticipated to be around &pound;1&middot;5 million. Those set-up costs and running  costs are broadly in line with those incurred by the Welsh Assembly when it  established its Commissioner for Older People. We are determined to proceed  with the appointment of the commissioner and to provide him or her with the  necessary resources to promote and safeguard the interests and rights of older  people.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are confident that the concerns of the Committee for the  Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister have been addressed.  First, there is evidence of real gaps in oversight provision, which we provided  to the Committee and with which it was content. Secondly, the sole purpose of  some provisions in the Bill is to avoid duplication of the commissioner&rsquo;s work  with that of other bodies that already possess the responsibility, expertise  and publicly funded resources to act on a complaint raised by an older person.  Thirdly, we will highlight the importance of that issue to the commissioner  upon appointment, as well as the importance of agreeing memoranda of  understanding with appropriate oversight bodies to clarify roles and  responsibilities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, the Bill contains a review mechanism. The  commissioner will have a legal obligation to carry out reviews of the adequacy  and effectiveness of the legislation. The commissioner can make recommendations  to amend the legislation, if that is considered appropriate. In the first  instance, such a review must be carried out as soon as possible after three  years of the Act coming into force and, at the latest, every five years  thereafter. However, as I explained during Consideration Stage, if significant  difficulties arise, Ministers will move ahead of the review process to address  and to remedy the problems and, if necessary, to amend the Act.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.45 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important in these considerations to stress that no  single organisation has the range of powers and functions that the commissioner  will have. The commissioner will concentrate in a holistic and strategic manner  on the rights and interests of older people. That point was made by Martina  Anderson.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to reiterate Minister Kelly&rsquo;s point on cost and  value for money. I have already said that we are determined to proceed with the  appointment and to provide the commissioner with the necessary powers and  resources to promote and to safeguard older persons&rsquo; interests. The needs of an  increasingly ageing population present issues that cannot be ignored. Given the  compelling statistics that many Members referred to today, I believe that, now  more than ever, we need a commissioner to protect the rights of older people.  Ensuring value for money has been a consideration throughout the process, and  many individuals and organisations that responded to the public consultation  provided practical solutions as to how best to ensure that. We will, of course,  ensure that all public services are being delivered as effectively and  efficiently as possible.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Let me agree with the valid point that was made by Mr  Spratt. A measure of the efficiency and effectiveness of the consultation is  that it cost only &pound;13 a person. That takes into account all costs. That is a  measure of how seriously OFMDFM has taken the matter of efficiency and  effectiveness.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I pay tribute to those who were involved in the  consultation process, especially those from OFMDFM. The manner in which the  consultation process was undertaken and the relationship that was built with  the lobby groups from the age sector, as they lobbied meetings, for instance,  are examples of good practice. I believe that the processes used could be  written up as an example of an effective way of moving legislation through the  Chamber and of how to consult on, react to and process matters.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are committed to critically examining all aspects of the  Department&rsquo;s expenditure, including the funding for sponsored public bodies and  the potential to reduce costs through the sharing of resources among sponsored  bodies. George Robinson made that point.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A concern expressed during the development process was the  need to ensure that the commissioner will have the power to make a real  difference to older people. When making his case for North Belfast and, in  doing so, talking about the lifespan of some of the people who live in his  constituency, Mr Humphrey made the case about the complexities in that  situation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I can confirm that the commissioner will have a wide range  of powers, including the power to conduct a formal investigation into a  complaint, with High Court powers to call for persons, papers and evidence, as  well as the power of entry and inspection. If someone were to attempt to  obstruct a commissioner, those powers would be backed up with the offence of  contempt.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  I thank the Minister for giving way. Does he agree that the effectiveness of  the commissioner&rsquo;s work will be in the outworking of their powers and the  practical impact of that on older peoples&rsquo; lives? For example, the age bar,  which was referred to earlier, that is placed on access to the regional  acquired brain injury unit worked adversely against my constituent Mr Michael  Hanratty. Does he agree that the commissioner&rsquo;s effectiveness and success will  be judged against how they deal with issues such as the age bar and in removing  that type of discrimination?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr Newton)</strong>: I thank the Member for his intervention. Obviously, a  very serious situation arose with his constituent and I do not want to minimise  that in any way. If the Member is patient, I will come to that at the end of my  speech.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The commissioner will be able to intervene or assist in a  court case involving the interests of older people and provide assistance,  including financial assistance, to an older person in a court case. As an  alternative to legal proceedings, the commissioner will now also have the power  to commission conciliation services to help to resolve a dispute more quickly.  That power was added following public consultation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To stand up for older people, the commissioner will have  the power to advise Ministers, the Assembly, the Secretary of State and any  body or person on any matter concerning that section of our community. The  commissioner will be empowered to make recommendations to strengthen existing  legislation. The commissioner can produce research to help to shape policy and  services and to report on key issues that affect older people, such as  transport, fuel poverty and finance. The commissioner will also have a wide  range of promotional, advisory, educational and general investigatory  functions, duties and powers to be deployed in the interests of older people,  generally and individually.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Bresland made the point about efficiency and value for  money. I think that that may be seen through the shared resources, which I hope  will, ultimately, bring about not only a solution for the Commissioner for  Older People but for commissioners generally. Those powers will help the  commissioner to fulfil the aims of protecting the interests of older people,  and he or she will be able to influence the actions of many organisations and  individuals that affect older people&rsquo;s lives in many different ways.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Farry, speaking as the Deputy Chairperson of the OFMDFM  Committee, raised the issue of enforcement. As I have said already, the  commissioner will be endowed with High Court powers to call for persons, papers  and evidence. If someone were to obstruct the commissioner, those powers would  be backed up with the offence of contempt. The commissioner will have the power  to take legal action on behalf of older persons.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mary Bradley expressed the early concerns of the OFMDFM  Committee, or perhaps they were her early concerns. The commissioner will bring  together expertise and a focus on improving older persons&rsquo; lives, and will be  able to guide them through complex complaint mechanisms. They will also be able  to advocate on their behalf, and, where necessary, investigate issues that do  not fall within the remit of other statutory bodies.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The office of the Commissioner for Older People is unique:  no existing organisation has the remit to address the wider impact to inform  systemic improvements and influence wider social policy. I was intrigued by a  point that was made by Mickey Brady. He emphasised the economic benefits of the  Bill. I had not thought about that but, when one considers the Bill&rsquo;s potential  to release increased benefits for older persons, it is clear that that is a  very positive step.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Ultimately, what we want to achieve by establishing a  commissioner is to have someone who will stand up for older people; someone who  will challenge discrimination against older people and promote their participation  in public life; someone who will investigate complaints on behalf of the  sector; someone who will encourage best practice in the treatment of older  people; and someone who will influence and shape government policy in the  interests of older people. Ultimately, we want to have a society in which the  voices of older people are heard and respected and their interests safeguarded  and promoted.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If the Bill receives the Assembly&rsquo;s support today, the next  stage will be Royal Assent, which should be completed in mid- to late January.  The Bill will then, of course, become law. The next step after that is to begin  the recruitment process for the appointment of the commissioner, and that is a  process in which older people will be involved. My OFMDFM ministerial  colleagues and I believe that the legislation will place the Assembly at the  forefront of world opinion on how to successfully deal with the very real  difficulties that all countries have to confront and the very real  opportunities that will arise over the coming decades through having an older  and, I am confident, wiser population. I commend the Commissioner for Older  People Bill to the House.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That the Commissioner for Older People Bill [NIA 21/09] do  now pass.</p>

    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That the Second Stage of the Autism Bill [NIA 2/10] be  agreed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. T&aacute;  an-&aacute;thas orm go bhfuil an Dara C&eacute;im den Bhille Uathachais sa Teach inniu.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill consists of seven clauses. The first three clauses  form the main part of the Bill, and they deal with the amendment to the  Disability Discrimination Act 1995 &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. There should be only one Member on his or her feet.  Members, please resume your seats.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  As I was saying, the main part of the Bill deals with the amendment to the  Disability Discrimination Act 1995 and the autism strategy. The remaining four  clauses concern interpretation, commencement, regulations and the short title.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I bring the Bill before the House on behalf of people with  autism in Northern Ireland  and on behalf of their families. I also bring it here on behalf of the  all-party Assembly group on autism, of which I am chairperson, on my own behalf  and on behalf of the SDLP. Members of the all-party Assembly group on autism  will speak in the debate and will acknowledge their membership of the group. I  want to publicly thank the group&rsquo;s members for their commitment and support in  the preparation of the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Second Stage deals with the general principles behind a  Bill, and, in this case, they are quite straightforward: to ensure that people  with autism in Northern Ireland are afforded the rights that are their due and  that comprehensive services are provided to them and their families from their  earliest years and throughout their lives on a cross-departmental basis,  because, as we know, autism is a developmental disorder that affects the way in  which a person communicates with, and relates to, other people throughout their  whole life.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To ensure that people with autism have full access to the  range of services that they need, it is necessary to have autism recognised  under the Disability Discrimination Act as a social and communicative disorder  that affects how they make sense of the world around them. Autism is a spectrum  condition, which means that, although all people with autism share three main  areas of difficulty, their condition will affect them in different ways and  they will rely on a variety of services at various stages in their life.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.00 noon</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A triad of impairments largely defines autism. People with  autism have difficulty with social interaction and with recognising and  understanding other people&rsquo;s feelings and managing their own. Autism also  includes difficulty in understanding how to interact with others, making it  difficult for people with autism to form friendships, and that, in turn, leads  to loneliness and isolation. There are also difficulties with social  communication, including the use and understanding of verbal and non-verbal  language, such as gestures, facial expression and tone of voice.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As regards social imagination, people with autism have  difficulties in understanding and predicting other people&rsquo;s intentions and  behaviour and imagining situations outside their own routine. That can be  accompanied by a narrow, repetitive range of activities. Around 15% of people  with autism are able to live a relatively independent life. Others,  unfortunately, need a lifetime of specialist care. People with autism may also  experience some form of sensory sensitivity or undersensitivity to sounds,  touch, tastes, lights or colours.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Asperger&rsquo;s syndrome is also a form of autism. People with  it are often of average or above-average intelligence. They have fewer problems  with speech but may still have difficulty understanding and processing  language. People with Asperger&rsquo;s syndrome do not necessarily have learning  disabilities but often have accompanying learning difficulties, such as  dyslexia.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Health Department&rsquo;s programmes of care for autism are  inadequate because ASD is placed in the mental health and learning disability  programme of care, with its budget coming from that for learning disability.  Such an approach perpetuates the use of IQ as a gateway to services for people  with ASD, and that means that 75% of people with ASD fall outside service  entitlement. In amending the Disability Discrimination Act, the Bill will help  to ensure that such people will no longer suffer discrimination due to that  anomaly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Along with the IQ anomaly, there is evidence that some  public bodies use the DDA definition of disability as a guide in  decision-making about the award of such benefits as disability living  allowance. Some schools punish pupils with ASD for offences against the  schools&rsquo; codes of discipline for behavioural reactions that are beyond the  students&rsquo; control. Why is that happening? Simply because ASD is not recognised  as a disability under the DDA, and that leads to the expectation that pupils  will adhere to rules of behaviour to which, through no fault of their own, they  cannot adhere. The amendment to the DDA will give clear guidance to government  bodies, schools and other organisations, by ensuring that ASD is brought  clearly within the scope of the Disability Discrimination Act. For families,  that measure will give recognition to a challenging condition that has been low  in our society&rsquo;s hierarchy of disability.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When implemented across public bodies, the Bill has the  potential to improve public understanding in general, as well as to improve  issues such as access to services and buildings for individuals with ASD.  Significantly, it will signal the beginning of the end of discrimination against  individuals with ASD whose IQ is over 70.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">By giving recognition to ASD in law, the Bill will make a  practical and emotional difference to families through the systematic education  of the public that will flow from adaptations to public spaces, facilities and  services. The clarity that will come through ASD being recognised in law will  bring a level of validity to those with a condition that is still treated with  suspicion and indeed ignorance by some professionals and agencies. Clarity in  law will guide decision-making about benefit entitlements and the updating of  disability action plans for public bodies and improve access to equality legislation.  Families will have a reference point for service entitlement and will no longer  have to deal with the anomaly of the issue of an IQ of over 70. The physical  adaptations to public buildings will assist not just people with ASD but the  wider disabled community.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that the Bill will take autism in from the cold to  the mainstream of services and help to ensure that people, including many  adults, who are denied services will receive the help and support that, by  right, they should have now.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  As the Member knows, I fully support the Bill, but I have one disappointment in  the removal from the Bill of plans for an advocate. Are there any plans for  appointing an advocate, and how can that issue be dealt with?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  I thank the Member for his intervention, and I will address the issue that he  raised later in my speech.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Autism is much more common in our society than many people  know or believe. It is estimated that there are 17,000 people with autism in Northern Ireland.  If we take into account immediate family members affected, autism touches the  lives of a staggering 68,000-plus people. In August 2008, the National Autistic  Society (NAS) in Northern Ireland  commissioned a leading market research company to survey a sample of the Northern Ireland  population on their awareness and understanding of autism. The survey clearly  showed that 90% did not know how common autism is; only 48% of people had heard  of Asperger&rsquo;s syndrome, which, as I said, is a form of autism; and 55% of  people who had heard of autism thought it mostly if not only affected children.  This Bill will raise public awareness and help to dissipate the ignorance  around autism.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The gap in services that makes the Bill so necessary is  evidenced by the 2008 NAS campaign, I Exist. That campaign highlighted the  stark and often desperate reality for the majority of adults with autism in Northern Ireland,  who do not receive the support and services that they so badly need. The report  that accompanied the launch of that campaign showed that 96% of adults who took  part in the survey felt that, with more support, they would feel less isolated.  As a direct result of the lack of support, 34% of adults in the survey had  experienced severe mental health difficulties; 65% had experienced anxiety; and  57% had suffered from depression. Most adults depend solely on their family for  support. Sixty-four per cent of adults in the survey lived at home; 13% lived  on their own; and only a quarter were financially independent.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Those statistics give us an indication of the reality of  life for those with autism in Northern    Ireland. Adults with autism who rely solely  on their parents for support will, inevitably, face a time when their parents  can no longer care for them. According to the survey, 83% of parents and carers  are worried about what will happen to their son or daughter when they can no  longer support or care for them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Autism Northern    Ireland commissioned two related research  reports on family support &mdash; &lsquo;The Hidden Community&rsquo; and &lsquo;Is Anyone Listening?&rsquo; &mdash;  which focused on the human cost of living with autism. Among the intersecting  issues from those investigations are the lack of recognition of the challenges  that the disability presents to carers; the isolation that carers feel; and the  requirement for constant combative lobbying to secure recognition and services.  That is energy-sapping and often leaves people physically and emotionally  drained and near to total exhaustion. The evidence shows that the stress levels  of primary carers for family members who have autism are unique in the  disability community. The latest local research gives us a sliding scale from  80% of mothers who experience high levels of anxiety through to 50% who are on  long-term medication linked to trauma and stress. The need is clearly there  among people of all ages who have autism and among those who care for them.  This Bill can and will address that need and will make a real difference to  their lives.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Autism Bill will direct the establishment of a  cross-cutting approach to autistic spectrum disorder by requiring the  development of a cross-departmental strategy for autism. The historic failure  to recognise ASD has left a tragic legacy of underfunding across Departments.  All Departments will eventually have to address the impact of legislative  change on their policies, practice and provision for people with ASD. Clause 2  creates a requirement for Departments to undertake that exercise together in an  effort to minimise duplication and maximise effectiveness. I presume that there  is wide consensus around the view that the development of single-Department ASD  strategies by the Department of Health and, more recently, the Department of  Education is in sharp contrast to the joined-up realities of life, where one  life transition leads to another across home, education, employment and  community.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In this climate of economic constraint it is incumbent on  us all to plan smartly for future challenges. Not only is cross-departmental  commitment to joint planning for ASD good practice, it is an opportunity to  look afresh at how resources can be used or redeployed while challenging all  Departments to work innovatively with the voluntary sector to maximise the  accountability, flexibility and creativity of all partners. By recognising in  law the need for required cross-departmental planning and buy-in, the Bill will  make a real difference to families. That measure assures families that the  Government recognise the lifelong and whole-life commitment and reality of ASD,  and it gives assurance of the potential of service development, even in harsh  economic times, through shared funding initiatives across Departments. The Bill  recognises that ASD is a shared responsibility in our community and that  duplication and confusion can be addressed. It should also help to ensure that  life transitions, which are uniquely distressing for individuals with autism,  can be planned, resourced and well managed.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill deals with the accountability issue raised by Mr  Easton by placing a duty on the Minister of the designated lead Department,  namely the Health Department, to report to the Assembly every three years on  the implementation of the autism strategy. The original draft of the Bill  envisaged a commissioner to ensure accountability. However, the provision was  withdrawn in light of current financial conditions. If, in future, the  reporting mechanism needs additional back-up, consideration can be given to the  possibility of a commissioner. I hope that that satisfies Mr Easton.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In advance of the publication of the draft Autism Bill,  concerns focusing largely on the perceived implementation costs and the impact  that such legislation would have on other disability groups were noted. All  views were listened to carefully; that has been the policy of the all-party  group since its establishment in 2008 in response to a six-year campaign by  families committed to social change.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the past, special separate measures, such as the three  health and social care trust strategies for ASD, the Department of Health&rsquo;s  strategy, the Department of Education&rsquo;s strategy, task force report, and  guidance and policies and the education and library boards&rsquo; ASD policies have  been the approaches used, because existing, generic disability policies were  seen to be inadequate. In 2008, the all-party group commissioned the only  independent research on the systemic changes required by government to address  the failures in ASD service prioritisation, provision and planning. That  report, which was produced by the Assembly&rsquo;s Research and Library Service,  placed the need for legislation front and centre, and it concluded that  individual departmental approaches, such as those mentioned, were seen as  temporary fixes that would not work in the long term. According to the report,  legislation was the best long-term solution.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">More recently, in March and April 2010, consultation on the  proposed legislation was conducted across statutory and voluntary agencies,  resulting in a 70% to 80% positive rating for legislation. In addition, the  Assembly, NILGA and most of the 26 district councils passed unanimous motions  in support of the required legislative changes. We held follow-up meetings with  the Equality Commission, the Children&rsquo;s Commissioner and Disability Action,  resulting in agreed positions on the potential benefits of the Bill. All the  autism charities in Northern    Ireland, including Autism NI, PEAT, NAS,  CEAT, SPEAC and Autism Initiatives, support the proposed legislation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Precedent has already been established for the approach  taken in the Bill. A single condition ASD focus already exists in the English  Autism Act 2009. A government strategy for ASD exists in Wales and may soon be established in Scotland. The  Disability Discrimination Act 1995 has, in the past, been amended to include  specific conditions that sit more easily within the existing definition of  disability than ASD, such as HIV, multiple sclerosis and cancer. In England, the  Disability Discrimination Act 1995 has been replaced by the Equality Act 2010,  and the definition of &ldquo;disability&rdquo; in that Act is currently subject to  consultation. The Republic   of Ireland&rsquo;s Disability  Act 2005 includes definitions of sensory conditions and physical and mental  health.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that I have dealt adequately with the general  principles of the Autism Bill. It is the majority position of the all-party  Assembly group on autism that those general principles are sound and that they  will lead, if enacted, to a huge improvement for people with autism in Northern Ireland.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr Wells)</strong>:  Autistic spectrum disorder is a lifelong developmental condition that affects  those who live with it in different ways. Essentially, however, it affects the  way in which a person communicates with and relates to other people. It is a  serious condition that has a significant impact not only on individuals but on  their families and carers. I can speak on behalf of all members of the  Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety when I say that we  welcome the seriousness with which the health and social care sector, other  statutory agencies and, indeed, the Assembly are now treating autism and ASD.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee has, since its inception, shown a close  interest in the delivery of services to children and adults who live with  autism. The Committee is committed to finding the best way to deliver those  services and has examined the issue on a number of occasions. When the  Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety consulted on its  autistic spectrum disorder strategic action plan in 2008, the Committee took  evidence from the major autism charities and the independent review of autism  services. Committee members visited Wales to study the workings of the  Welsh Assembly Government&rsquo;s autistic spectrum disorder strategy, which has been  in place since April 2008.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee commended much in the Department&rsquo;s strategy  but expressed concerns that the action plan sought to address services for  people with autism solely from a health and social care perspective. At that  time, the Committee emphasised the view that the provision of services for  people with autism benefits greatly from being addressed on a  cross-departmental basis. Although autism may be primarily a health issue,  other Departments, including the Department of Education, the Department for  Employment and Learning, the Department for Social Development and the Department  of Justice, have a crucial role to play.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">More recently, the Committee undertook prelegislative  scrutiny of the Autism Bill. On 14 October 2010, the Committee was briefed by  Mr Dominic Bradley, who was accompanied by a representative of the secretariat  of the all-party Assembly group on autism. At that time, the Committee had  before it Mr Bradley&rsquo;s draft Bill. An interesting discussion ensued, and the  Committee debated and explored various issues with Mr Bradley, including the  proposed cross-departmental strategy, the proposed changes to the Disability  Discrimination Act 1995 and the issue of resources. Following the discussion  with Mr Bradley, the Committee held an evidence session on 2 December 2010 with  officials from the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety in  order to gauge the Department&rsquo;s view on the Autism Bill. The Department had  serious reservations about the Bill, which, no doubt, the Minister will  elaborate on in detail today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee recognises that the Member who brought the  Bill to the House and the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  are committed to improving services for those who live with autism. However,  they disagree on how those services can be best delivered, whether through  legislation or the departmental strategies that set out how each Department  will provide the services for which it is responsible. There is a lack of  convergence on the resource implications of the Bill. Pending a successful  Second Stage and the referral of the Bill to the Health Committee, we will  examine the clauses of the Bill and their implications in detail.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As with any Bill, the Committee will take evidence from key  stakeholders who are involved in providing services to children and adults with  autism and from organisations that may be affected by the Bill. The Committee  recognises that complex issues are in play and that there are different  opinions on the various aspects of the Bill. We will listen carefully to all  views and come to our decisions on the basis of the evidence that is put before  us.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">For obvious reasons, I will take a neutral stance on any  further discussions today. It is important that the Chairman of the Committee  goes in with an open mind as we gather evidence on this important issue.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has arranged to meet immediately upon  lunchtime suspension. I propose, therefore, by leave of the Assembly, to  suspend the sitting until 2.00 pm.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The debate stood suspended.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The sitting was suspended at 12.25 pm.</p>

    <p class="OralAnswers-H2DepartmentHeading">Agriculture and Rural Development</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Questions 1 and 14 have been withdrawn.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Rural Tourism</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">2. <strong>Mr  Neeson </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development what  progress her Department has made in promoting rural tourism.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 691/11<a name="AQO691/11" id="AQO691/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development (Ms Gildernew)</strong>: Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat,  a LeasCheann Comhairle. I commend all the intrepid people from Fermanagh, Derry, Tyrone and Donegal for getting here today. I am  looking for all the Members from East Belfast  who are not here.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  What about the Ards   Peninsula?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Good man, Kieran; you are never one to  miss a chance.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Rural tourism is vital to the sustainability of rural  communities, which is why the rural development programme (RDP) contains a  measure to encourage tourism, with a budget of &pound;12 million. Measure 3.3 of the  RDP, which concerns the encouragement of tourism activities, specifically  targets funding to tourism. Additionally, farming families wishing to diversify  into self-catering and activity-based tourism can apply under measure 3.1,  which relates to farm diversification.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased to report that, to date, almost &pound;6 million has  been approved for tourism projects, and that accounts for 50% of the funding  that is available under the measure. By adding the further funding that is  allocated under farm diversification, it becomes clear that the RDP is  contributing significantly towards the development of rural tourism.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, Forest Service officials have been involved in  discussions with the Tourist Board and other stakeholders regarding the  possible contribution from forests and how that can best be delivered. The  Loughs Agency has also been involved in discussions. Its remit is for marine  tourism and angling, much of which is rural in context and, therefore, assists  in supporting rural tourism.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>: I  am sure that there are many picture postcard scenes throughout rural parts of County Fermanagh  today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To what extent does the Department work with the Northern  Ireland Tourist Board (NITB) and Tourism Ireland on the development of rural  tourism?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: My Department works with all agencies  and partners that work in tourism. For example, the director of our rural  development division, Keith Morrison, was working with the Department of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI) on its tourism strategy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although the programmes have been delivered through a  bottom-up approach, obviously, we must look at it on a cross-cutting and  strategic level. We work with NITB to ensure that, for example, our strategies  are taken account of in its signature projects. We liaise closely with Tourism Ireland, and we  have worked closely with NITB, for example, on a cycling trail in the Mournes,  which, again, will help to encourage tourism potential there. NITB is a key  partner in that. We work with whatever agency can help to add value to what we  are doing and to encourage and maximise the benefits to rural communities.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  Bearing in mind that the F&aacute;ilte Ireland Irish homecoming initiative in 2012  will see hundreds of thousands of emigrants returning, many of them to rural  communities in this country, does the Department have any plans that would  enable rural communities here to benefit from that initiative?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: The work that is ongoing through the  rural development programme has delivered a number of self-catering cottages,  etc. The Member will be aware of those, given that quite a number of them are  in the constituency of Fermanagh and South Tyrone. The rural community there is  investing in the tourism infrastructure, which contributes to the amount of bed  spaces that are available to people who visit those parts. That involves  looking not just to 2012 but well into the future, to help to deliver a tourism  product in areas that have traditionally been left behind.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Animal Feedstuffs</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">3. <strong>Miss  McIlveen </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development if she can  give an assurance that sufficient measures are in place to ensure the  traceability of animal feedstuffs so that the reputation of local beef and lamb  products can be protected.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  692/11<a name="AQO692/11" id="AQO692/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: The primary responsibility for food  traceability lies with the feed business operators (FBOs) at each stage of the  food chain. FBOs include importers, processors, hauliers and farmers. My  inspectors check traceability of feedstuffs during audits and inspections of  FBOs, and they require corrective action where there are shortcomings, with  formal action being taken against persistent offenders. My departmental  officials work closely with industry representatives and the Food Standards  Agency (FSA) to ensure that appropriate feed traceability controls are in place  and are rigorously checked.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  Given the traceability of the premier product that we produce in Northern Ireland,  is it not time that our producers received a premium return on that product? To  that end, will the Minister inform the House about the work being carried out  by her Department with the industry to brand our beef as is done in Scotland?  When will we see Ulster beef and lamb on our supermarket shelves?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: As the Member has pointed out, food  produced here is of a high quality, and its origin is a selling point that  should be utilised by the industry. However, that is primarily a commercial  matter, as state aid constraints preclude government from promoting local  produce based on origin. I also point out that food labelling is a  responsibility of the Food Standards Agency.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My Department assists producer groups by raising awareness  of marketing opportunities available to them through supply chain initiatives.  We also assist representative groups to deliver the regional food programme,  which is now in its fourth year and which recently opened a second call for  applications this year. Over the past four years, the regional food programme  provided funding of approximately &pound;1 million for a range of initiatives, such  as the food pavilion at the Balmoral Show and the Great Belfast Food Week.  Locally, the Livestock and Meat Commission (LMC) is responsible for promoting  red meat, and it has continued that promotion through 2010 with the farm  quality assurance scheme and the website, lovebeefandlamb.com, as well as  through school demonstrations and retail sampling. Invest NI is responsible for  the international marketing of local produce, and its representatives and local  companies have recently returned from an international food and red meat trade  fair, SIAL 2010, which was held in France.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, the Member may be aware of NI Good Food, a  privately run organisation that has been established to provide a single  promotional voice for the North&rsquo;s food and drink industry. Members include  representative bodies from across the supply chain as well as individual  private enterprises, and the organisation aims to enhance the reputation of  local food and drink and to deliver positive messages to support the industry.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burns</strong>:  The Member for Strangford raised an important issue, given the increase in  trade across the island of Ireland. Does the Minister accept the importance of  having regular discussions with her counterpart in the Republic of Ireland on  the traceability of animal feed components and livestock?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Absolutely. I have had frequent  discussions on that and other issues with my counterpart in Dublin. The issue  came up at the last North/South Ministerial Council (NSMC) plenary meeting. I  have said publicly on a number of occasions that the more we work together to  market our produce to the rest of the world, rather than competing with each  other, the more all our businesses can benefit from that approach. I have had a  lot of discussions on the issue with my counterpart, Brendan Smith, and I have  also met Bord B&iacute;a and others to discuss it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Doherty</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Unfortunately, I have noticed  recently that Bord B&iacute;a has brought forward proposals to change its quality mark  so that it can distinguish between products in the South and in the North. Has  the Minister taken any steps to respond to that?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Yes, I have. I am very aware of the  issue, which NIFDA (Northern Ireland Food and Drink Association) raised  directly with me. I followed that up with telephone calls and by writing to  Brendan Smith to outline my concerns. As I said, the issue was raised at the  NSMC meeting at the end of June. Following my intervention, Bord B&iacute;a agreed to  engage with NIFDA to undertake further market research into the proposed  quality logo, which is funded by industry contributions. Ultimately, labelling  will be determined by two areas: legislation, which, in the North, is  controlled by the FSA, and the marketplace. However, as I said, I have  consistently stated that a joint approach to marketing products from the island  of Ireland would benefit all producers on the island and is the most desirable  way forward.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Agriculture and Forestry Processing and  Marketing Grant Scheme</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">4. <strong>Mr  Molloy </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development for an  update on the EU agriculture and forestry processing and marketing grant scheme  as part of the rural development programme.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  693/11<a name="AQO693/11" id="AQO693/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: The EU agriculture and forestry  processing and marketing grant (PMG) scheme closed for applications in March  2010 because of lack of budget availability. However, I was successful in a bid  for additional funds for the scheme in the June monitoring round, and that has  allowed officials to consider eight project applications for funding that had  already been submitted prior to the March 2010 closure. A selection panel was  held in October, and I am pleased to report that letters of offer to the value  of &pound;1&middot;5 million to five successful companies were issued on 19 November 2010.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As part of the rural development programme, the PMG scheme  has provided funding of &pound;8&middot;44 million to a total of 27 projects, including the  most recent awards on 19 November. At a rate of funding of up to 40% of total  expenditure, that &pound;8&middot;44 million of PMG financial assistance to agrifood  processers provides support for investment by those local companies of  approximately &pound;21 million. I will make a decision on the reopening of the scheme  after the Executive have agreed departmental budgets for the next financial  year.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her response. Why can the Department not have a single  funding stream to help small food processors under the rural development  programme?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: The rural development programme has a  range of measures that are designed to meet the needs of the rural community  and economy, and each measure has clear objectives that are to be met. I know  that there has been some concern among small food processors about funding  streams, and my officials are now considering establishing a single point of  contact in the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) to which  all applications from food processors will be directed. That will allow  applications from food processors to be considered for funding without the  applicant&rsquo;s having to decide which axis or measure his or her project should be  submitted to, and DARD staff will then signpost applications to the appropriate  axis, depending on what percentage of annexe 1 raw material inputs into the  project.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  The Minister will be aware that many people who apply for those grants will  have to find match funding. Is she content that the banks and other financial  organisations are doing everything that they can to try to help out farmers and  individuals who are applying? What steps can she, through her Department, take  to try to help with that?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I have met the banks on a number of  occasions. I had all four banks in at a meeting, and I will meet them again, if  necessary, to address the issue. I also meet the banks regularly at different  events, and this issue comes up regularly. I encourage people who are interested  in applying for funding from the rural development programme or for any kind of  funding to shop around if their bank is not co-operating with them or is not  able to lend. We are loyal to our banks. Indeed, I have been with the same bank  since I was 17, and people do not tend to jump ship very often.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In what is a harsh economic climate, there are deadlines on  spend, and we have to spend the money before the end of the financial year or  it is lost, not only to the person who is applying for the money but to the  Department. It is important that they get the money spent. If money is  available from government and the banks are not lending, my message to people  is that they should shop around. They should go to another bank to see whether  they can get a better deal from one of their bank&rsquo;s competitors.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  It is good advice to shop around at all times. Does the Minister have any  analysis from her Department on the co-operation that has been received from  Planning Service relating to the delivery of the rural development programme?  Quite often, planning approval is a prerequisite for grant approval.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: At the start of my time as Minister of  Agriculture, I met the Minister of the Environment to discuss that issue. Where  a project is dependent on grant aid of any type that has a deadline on funding  spend, Planning Service will fast-track the application and get it through. If  people are still finding problems with Planning Service, my advice is that they  talk to their local MLA or councillor and emphasise the fact that their grant  is dependent on its being spent by a certain time. The planning office will try  to co-operate with them to get the planning approval through in time for the  money to be spent.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Woodland Inventory</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">5. <strong>Ms Lo </strong>asked  the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development whether a woodland inventory  would help in monitoring progress on woodland creation and woodland loss.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 694/11<a name="AQO694/11" id="AQO694/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: A woodland inventory will help in  monitoring the extent of woodlands in the North of Ireland, including their  creation and loss over time. In earlier replies on this subject, I indicated  that Forest Service maintains an accurate inventory of the woodland that it  manages and has comprehensive records of woodlands established under its grant  schemes. I said that Forest Service would consider using other available  woodland information to provide more comprehensive inventory data, allowing  changes in woodland cover over the long term to be more fully captured. That  work has commenced, and, in accordance with the Forestry Act 2010, it is my  intention that it will lead to the eventual publication of a woodland register,  containing information on the location and size of woodlands and the types of  trees contained in them. As envisaged in the 2010 Act, the register will be  published at intervals not exceeding 10 years.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her comprehensive answer. I understand that, so far, the  Department has achieved only around 33% of its woodland creation target, with  only around six months of the mandate left. Will the Minister advise the House  of what steps she is taking to improve that?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I covered that issue in the House  recently. The Department has not met that target, which is disappointing. It is  difficult to achieve it in the current climate. I accept that we probably will  not meet the target that was envisaged at the beginning of the Programme for  Government period.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">New woodland grants are available. The difficulty with them  is that the level of farm income that is required to obtain the grant is not  the same as for other grants. Therefore, if someone applies for a grant under  the rural development programme, for example, 15% of that person&rsquo;s income must  come from farming, whereas, to access the woodland grant, 25% farming income is  required. That creates a difference. It is a problem for people whose farming  income is between 15% and 25%.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have met private stakeholders from the forestry sector  and a range of individuals to discuss the issue. I have raised it with the EU  commissioner and his officials. To date, we have not been able to achieve a  satisfactory outcome. I recognise that the issue is holding the Department back  from achieving its targets. We will probably not meet them. That is  regrettable. We are doing everything that we can to try to meet those targets.  However, they are extremely challenging.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as  an fhreagra sin.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister agree that it would be better if the new  woodlands comprise mixed species of trees, rather than single species, to avoid  unsightly clear fell at a later date?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Absolutely. The Member is from a rural  constituency and knows how that can look. The information that the Department  will gather in the woodland register will identify the types of trees in  woodland, whether they are conifer, broadleaf, mixed conifer/broadleaf, or  short-rotation coppice, as a measure of woodland biodiversity. Some woodland is  mixed, whereas other woodland comprises single species, such as spruce. Therefore,  there are different needs. It is worth pointing out that in some woodland there  may be a need to thin out and remove unsightly non-indigenous conifers, for  example, so that more broadleaf trees can be planted in that space.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Mr McElduff is not in his place to ask question 6.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Flood Prevention</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">7. <strong>Mr  Callaghan </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development to  outline the plans her Department has to clean watercourses and rivers which  have a history of flooding.&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 696/11<a name="AQO696/11" id="AQO696/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Rivers Agency conducts a rolling  programme of cyclical inspection and carries out maintenance as required to  designated watercourses in the North of Ireland. Details of maintenance work  that is planned as a result of the inspections are published in the annual  watercourse maintenance programme on the Rivers Agency website.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Rivers Agency steps up monitoring and inspection at  high-risk locations with a history of flooding in advance of very heavy  rainfall and clears them, as necessary, to ensure free flow and to alleviate  the flooding risk. Following any significant flooding event, reaches of  watercourses that are known to have been affected are inspected. Any  significant blockages to their free flow are removed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will take this opportunity to remind the public that  dumping material in or near a river can easily lead to blockages and subsequent  flooding. Hedge and tree cuttings are major culprits because they can wash down  and block grills. Items of furniture should be disposed of properly, at council  waste sites. Many councils operate a free collection service for disposal of  bigger items. I do not need to say that shopping trolleys should not be  disposed of in the Foyle either.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>:  I concur with the Minister&rsquo;s remark about not putting trolleys into the Foyle.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Does she consider that stringent drainage restrictions in  areas of special scientific interest (ASSIs) have caused some preventable  flooding in the past? Will she consider a means by which to lessen that problem  in the future?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Rivers Agency must consider all issues  that may impact on its work. Some of those drainage schemes or maintenance  works may be in ASSIs or special environmental categories.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some of our elected representatives want Rivers Agency to  scope all rivers and to remove all foliage and trees from their banks. However,  that foliage is useful, and the fact that branches and trees hang into the  river does not, in itself, impact on future flooding.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Rivers Agency does everything that it can to maintain the  rivers, but there is somewhat of a dependency on it. Riparian landowners and  those who have watercourses on their land also have a responsibility to keep  waterways clear, and it is not always down to what Rivers Agency is or is not  doing. Indeed, when the flooding occurred in Fermanagh last year, Rivers Agency  went way over and above what it was statutorily required to do to help people  out during a very difficult time.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  Will the Minister pay particular attention to the designation of urban streams  when it comes to the clearing of debris and the impact that the non-clearance  of debris has on those streams? When streams are not designated, they tend to  accumulate rubbish, and that adds to the flooding problems in some parts of our  cities and towns.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I refer the Member back to my original  answer. People also need to be more careful about what they put in urban  streams, and our elected representatives need to send out that message. People  might think that because a river has a six-foot-high bank, it will make no  difference if rubbish is dumped in it, but when the water levels rise, the  water lifts debris from the banks, and it can block grilles. A grille may be  fine when inspected on a Monday, but if there is heavy rain that night or the  following day, that grille can become blocked within hours. Rivers Agency does  what it can to keep an eye on the grilles on an ongoing basis and employs cyclical  maintenance to keep them clear. However, we need people to work with us and not  to put debris into rivers and streams. They may feel that that debris is fairly  harmless, but as it accumulates and goes downstream, it can have a major impact  and can lead to people&rsquo;s homes and businesses being flooded.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Girvan</strong>: I  represent an area through which the Sixmilewater flows, and a number of the  tributaries that feed into that river are not designated. There is a request  for some of those to be upgraded, in particular the Doagh River, which flooded  last year and caused extensive damage to local businesses and properties.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question please.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Girvan</strong>:  Is it possible that some of those rivers could be taken under the Department&rsquo;s  control and be designated?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: The decision to designate lies with the  Drainage Council. A number of elected representatives sit on that council, and  if stretches of river are causing problems, Members should write to the Drainage  Council to encourage it to inspect them. The Department does not have the  ability to designate or undesignate watercourses.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Fishing</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">8. <strong>Mr Bell </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development to outline the  current pressures on our fishing industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  697/11<a name="AQO697/11" id="AQO697/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: The most immediate pressure facing the  fishing industry is the European Commission&rsquo;s proposals for 2011 fishing opportunities,  and radical changes are proposed for the management of the prawn quota. In  addition to moving to lower maximum sustainable yield quotas, it is proposed  that the large area 7 quota should be split into smaller sea-area units.  Although the quota would be cut across all the units by 17 %, the Irish Sea  units will fare better, and our fleet would suffer a cut in quota of only 6%.  However, if that functional unit management proposal is rejected, the  Commission may try to impose a cut of 17% on all fleets.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Commission has also proposed a 50% reduction in the  quota for cod and a 15% reduction in the quota for Irish Sea haddock, combined  with a likely further reduction in fishing time of 25%. Prospects for the Irish  Sea herring fishery remain good. However, I am annoyed that, despite sound  scientific evidence of a healthy stock, the Commission has refused to propose  an increased quota, even though that stock satisfies the Commission&rsquo;s criteria  for an increase.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Commission&rsquo;s proposals for 2011 are the latest in a  line of similar proposals, and, in recognition of their impact on the fishing  industry, the Fisheries Forum was established. Earlier this year, it reported  back to me and highlighted various pressures, including the lack of  profitability in the fleet, the need for restructuring and the need to consider  a decommissioning scheme. My Department has produced an action plan to deliver  the forum&rsquo;s recommendations. We look forward to working with it during 2011 to  implement those recommendations.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: I  thank the Minister for being across the detail on the pressures that our  fishing fleet is undergoing. However, can she share the pain of many fishing  families that I represent in Portavogie, whose livelihoods will be decimated if  those quotas and cuts go ahead? Is it not unacceptable that they are not  allowed to fish when they have a healthy stock?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I agree with the Member, and I feel his  pain. This is one of the hardest aspects of my job, because, where there are  other areas outside your control, this one is particularly harsh for the  fishing industry. When I talk about the industry, I do not mean just the fleet  and the people who catch fish. The processing sector is also under quite a bit  of pressure, and, obviously, the smaller the quota, the fewer fish are landed,  and the less raw material there is for them to process.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am going to Brussels on Monday and Tuesday. I expect that  to be the toughest negotiation yet. I met Maria Damanaki, the Fisheries  Commissioner, on Tuesday of last week, and impressed on her the difficulties  and challenges that all our fishing communities face in light of those  restrictions. It really is a very difficult situation for all concerned.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We will go out and do our absolute best. I will be meeting  the industry over the coming days, and we will be going in there and fighting  hard. However, it is like any negotiation: you get so far where you can get  people over the line, and then that is it, it is over, and where you are on  that scale when the negotiation closes is where you will end up. However, I  will do everything in my power to come back with as good a deal as I can for  our industry.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  A very depressing response from the Minister, as was the contribution from her  Department to the Agriculture Committee recently. I wish the Minister well in  Brussels. At least there is a local Minister going. When we had direct rule,  the guy did not even bother to go.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question, please.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  So, we wish you all the very best, and please bring good news back to  Portavogie and Ardglass. My question is: your Department had an opportunity to  help the cockle fishermen in Belfast Lough. As I understand it, the Commission  did not have any input into your Department saying no.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Can we have a question, please? Otherwise I will move on.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  Your Department did not allow fishermen to get in on that lucrative business in  Belfast Lough.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I have looked at that issue very  carefully over the past number of weeks, and I understand where the Member is  coming from. Further scientific work needs to be carried out on the cockle  fishery in Belfast Lough. We are hoping that we can open that fishery next  year, but it will be subject to our own scientific evidence. Again, we cannot  have a situation of enabling people to fish a stock that we do not know for a  fact is sustainable, thereby, perhaps, removing that resource from the lough.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member will also understand that I am not here to  depress him. However, I am here to be honest with the House, and to paint a  realistic picture of what is happening. Members need to understand, too, that  there are environmental concerns with any marine effort, and those have to be  taken into consideration.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her detailed reply. I am probably one of the most  pro-European Members of the House. However, it is very depressing to hear that  the Commission is now asking for further reductions in quota, particularly when  the scientific evidence indicates an increase in stocks. Is it not time for the  Minister to exercise perhaps more influence by using the European Parliament to  put pressure on the Commission to try to reverse the ridiculous situation of  putting Northern Irish fishermen out of work?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I will just correct the Member&rsquo;s  question, because he said that I was going to ask the Commission. You do not  get to ask the Commission; they tell you what the quotas will be. If it was a  matter of asking, I am more than capable of doing that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, the main thrust of his question was around our  MEPs. I work very closely with all three of our MEPs. They are all very  supportive on this issue. They do everything that they can to work with us and  to help us, and they recognise the challenges that we face. I honestly cannot  say anything about any of our MEPs and the effort that they are putting into  the industry. This is very much a combined effort, and I appreciate the help  and support that I get from the three MEPs on this and many other issues.</p>

    <p class="OralAnswers-H2DepartmentHeading"><a name="f"></a>Social Development</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Questions 1 and 10 have been withdrawn.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Public Sector Jobs</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">2. <strong>Mrs D  Kelly </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development whether he remains  committed to his predecessor&rsquo;s policy on the decentralisation of public sector  jobs within his remit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 705/11<a name="AQO705/11" id="AQO705/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development &nbsp;(Mr Attwood)</strong>: I  thank the Member for her question. I am committed to decentralisation. The  Department already has 27% of its staff outside greater Belfast. Organisations such as the Housing  Executive are, by their nature, located far and wide across the country. The  Bain proposals may have been suspended or put in doubt, but I will continue to  try to identify opportunities to decentralise services. The Charity  Commission&rsquo;s head office is a case in point. My predecessor committed to a  location outside Belfast,  and I remain committed to that outcome.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s continued commitment to decentralisation. Will he  offer some assurance that, in the decentralisation plans, consideration will be  given to the needs of employees in relation to their family commitments, and,  indeed, to wider environmental issues such as the reduction of the carbon  footprint in dealing with travel arrangements?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I would like to give that commitment. In making  decisions about decentralisation of services, there are a number of criteria  such as efficient and effective use of resources, accessibility to the general  population, and locating services in areas of need and neighbourhood renewal  that would incorporate and extend to the two issues identified by the Member.  The range of all those criteria is what should inform me or any other Minister  when making decisions about decentralisation.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  I am reassured by the Minister&rsquo;s reply to Mrs Kelly. I remind him that East Antrim currently and historically has the lowest  number of public sector jobs of any of the 18 constituencies. Given the issues  that Mrs Kelly highlighted, will the Minister seriously consider the relocation  of jobs to the East Antrim constituency?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I will consider the decentralisation of jobs to any  constituency that is under-represented, although I will give two health  warnings. First, given the capital and revenue budget that we may face in the  near future &mdash; in fact, the certainty that we will face reductions &mdash;  opportunities to decentralise may be fewer. That said, it is my view that the  current economic conditions create opportunities for us to do things  differently. I have just come back from a meeting where I spoke about the need  for organisations to consider sharing services, collaborating better, and even  merging. In the financial environment that we are about to face, is there not  now an opportunity to look again at the potential to decentralise? By saving  money, we may also be able to protect jobs.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  welcome the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to decentralisation. I take the point that  was made by the honourable Member for East Antrim.  I take the view that North Antrim &mdash;  particularly places like Ballymoney and Ballycastle &mdash; has fewer public sector  jobs. Will the Minister ensure that, in the decentralisation process and in the  reorganisation of existing offices under his control, he will not take jobs  away from towns such as Ballymoney, where that has already happened, and  Ballycastle and concentrate them in bigger conurbations in other  constituencies?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I do not want to build up false hopes that there is a  magic wand that can decentralise thousands of jobs. That would be misleading  the House. That said, beyond the issue of the Charity Commission, I have asked  officials to come back to me with a scoping exercise to consider where  opportunities may or may not exist. I do not want to exaggerate the potential,  but I certainly want to identify where the potential for decentralisation might  be, mindful of the health warnings that I have just laid down.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The real issue, though, when it comes to the Department for  Social Development (DSD) services, is not whether we will be able to maintain  services in local communities but whether, as part of the Budget outcomes, the  Government and the Executive decide that the spread of social security offices  that we have across Northern Ireland are a vital public service &mdash; especially in  a time of recession with 80,000, 90,000 or 100,0000 people unemployed, where social  security offices have a much greater customer demand &mdash; and protect those front  line services. As a consequence of that, the very point that Mr Storey makes  will be satisfied, local jobs in local areas will be protected and vital local  services will be provided to many people in need.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Winter Fuel Payment</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">3. <strong>Mr  McCarthy </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development to provide an update on  the winter fuel payment for 2010-11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  706/11<a name="AQO706/11" id="AQO706/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for his question, which is obviously  timely.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I confirm that winter fuel payments are an automatic  entitlement for people on certain qualifying benefits. As everyone over 65 is  in receipt of the pension, they are entitled to a payment. It is only men aged  between 60 and 65 who are not on a qualifying benefit who have to apply for it.  I encourage that category of person to make sure that they apply before the end  of March next year. As a consequence of that, they will receive the payment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In respect of all those who are currently entitled &mdash; and  that includes everyone who received the payment last year &mdash; all those payments  are being issued at the moment and should be received before Christmas.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his response. He will be aware that for some reason or  other a lot of people who are entitled to the winter fuel payment have not as  yet received it. That is particularly relevant during this spell of cold  weather. If I were Chairman of the Social Development Committee, I might ask  the Minister to consider his position, but I am not, so I do not.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question, please.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  What compensation, if any, will the Minister give to those people who are  sitting freezing in their homes because of some mess-up in some office  somewhere?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for his supplementary question. We  must be careful to differentiate the winter fuel payment, which is a payment of  &pound;250 for those who qualify over the age of 60 and &pound;400 to those over the age of  80. That payment is currently being processed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I presume that the Member refers to the cold weather  payment, which is a &pound;25 one-off payment made during a seven-day period when the  temperature is zero or below. Because of the failure of a processing centre in England to  enter the proper computer code, payments to about 14,000 people who are covered  by the Katesbridge weather station will not now be issued until 7 or 8  December.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I completely agree with the Member. I am fuming that  vulnerable people, during this cold snap, have not received their &pound;25. That  issue is currently being rectified. I have been reassured by the authorities in  London that a  further system has been put in place to ensure that, in the future, any such  wrong code will not be entered.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the Minister has said, there have been delays in the  issue of cold weather payments. That is blamed on IT failure. Will the Minister  assure us that this will be rectified and, in the future, will not happen? As  the Minister knows, until last year, cold weather payments had not been issued  since 2004. It is not as though the Department has not had enough time to  prepare for these eventualities.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: The Department has prepared for these eventualities, so  much so that, in the summer, I authorised an extension of the number of weather  stations in Northern Ireland  from five to seven. In an effort to ensure that those who are entitled receive  cold weather payments, I obtained a better spread of evidence and information.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Save my going to the computer centre in England and  entering the computer code myself, I cannot personally give that guarantee.  However, I have been reassured that a further system of checks has been put in  place to ensure that the correct computer codes are entered into the relevant  IT system in future, so that the error that has affected around 13,700 people  in the Katesbridge weather station area over the past couple of weeks does not  happen again. That error should never have arisen. I regret that and I am  fuming that it happened but, unfortunately, it was beyond my control.  Nevertheless, we have demonstrated that, except for that one occasion, all the  relevant people in six of the seven areas in the North have received at least  one, and, in some cases, more than one cold weather payment. Indeed, over the  next number of days, I anticipate that there will be announcements about  further cold weather payments.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  The Minister will be aware that I wrote to him recently about cold weather  payments. Many people in my constituency are concerned that the areas in which  they live are not considered to have experienced freezing conditions for seven  continuous days. Is the Minister content that the facilities used to measure  cold spells in each constituency can do that to the proper standard?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for his question, which is a fair  one. He asked whether I am satisfied that the way in which the weather stations  are spread out ensures that all those who are entitled to payments receive  them. Mr McCrea&rsquo;s constituency colleague Mr McGlone raised that very point with  me yesterday and mentioned, in particular, the people living in and around the Sperrin Mountains. I am sure that Mr McCrea is  also referring to that. As a consequence, I brought in the relevant officials  at lunchtime today to look at the spread of weather stations on the Northern Ireland  map to find out whether there is a gap in weather coverage that could affect  cold weather payments in any areas beyond and including the Sperrins. I am  actively looking at that matter, and I will report back to Mr McCrea and Mr  McGlone in due course.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burns</strong>:  Will the Minister tell the House what more DSD and others can do to alleviate  fuel poverty?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: No later than early in the new year, but perhaps prior  to that, I will make some further announcements about addressing fuel poverty in  times of need. We have an obligation to address that matter more generally. I  will provide the Member with some shape to my thinking. On my behalf and that  of the Executive, my permanent secretary is chairing a high-level team that is  looking at whether there is potential to roll out the green new deal, which  would make 100,000 homes energy efficient within three years and provide an  employment bounce for 2,300 or 2,400 people.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the very near future, I hope, for the first time, to  make a ministerial announcement about how we can try to deal with fuel costs. I  met the gas and electricity companies and the oil distributors last week to  determine what can be done through energy brokering to try to drive down costs.  It should be remembered that the housing association and Housing Executive  sector accounts for 120,000 houses in Northern Ireland. That should be  able to produce buy-in power to drive down costs and to reduce fuel poverty. I  am looking at all those issues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, I wish to make this point: I am deeply unhappy  that, to date, organisations such as BP, which imports 70% of the oil that 70%  of the households in Northern Ireland use for heating, have not found the time  or the space to meet me so that I can interrogate and question them about their  obligations to manage fuel prices in a way that reduces fuel poverty.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Benefits</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">4. <strong>Mr  McLaughlin </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development to provide an update  on his recent discussions with the Minister for Welfare Reform on the proposed  changes to benefit entitlement.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  707/11<a name="AQO707/11" id="AQO707/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for his question. I met the Welfare  Reform Minister, Lord Freud, in London  last Monday, and I updated the Committee for Social Development on Thursday  about the broad nature of those conversations. To collapse it all down, I will  make two points. First, it has been my sense that London welfare reform  Ministers want to get universal credit out the door, and they are in  negotiations with Treasury; therefore, they had not fully applied their minds  to the impact of benefit changes in the devolved jurisdictions, particularly in  Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The purpose of the meeting with Lord Freud was to impress  that upon him again. I think that he may be taking on board the historical and  current levels of deprivation in Northern Ireland, the legacy of conflict, the  risk of instability, the fact that we are still in recession, that housing  prices are still going down, and that impact of the economic situation in  Dublin on Northern Ireland has yet to be fully worked through. All those  factors and many others mean that Northern Ireland is a particular  case that requires particular remedies when it comes to benefit and welfare  changes. I continue to impress that argument on Lord Freud, and I will not give  up so doing.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  I thank the Minister for the detail of that answer. I and other MLAs would be  critical if the Minister were not making those strenuous efforts on behalf of  the vulnerable people in our society. He referred to the fact that he believes  that Lord Freud is now starting to listen to the arguments. Will the Minister  give us an indication of when he expects to see the substance of that response  as the outcome of his efforts to date?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I do not want to go into the full detail of the content  of the conversation with Lord Freud, but I indicated to the Committee, and I  will confirm to the House, that there are a number of streams that I am trying  to pursue. First, we are the only devolved arrangement that has legal and  legislative responsibility to pass laws when it comes to welfare. If I can  prevail over London  to give legislative flexibility about how we legislate for welfare and welfare  reform, it will create opportunities for us to do things differently.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, as a recent report from Professor Harrington  indicated in respect of Britain and the migration of incapacity benefit  claimants to employment and support allowance (ESA), if one builds in  operational flexibilities around how the law is then applied, including in  respect of guidance given to people who make assessments in the Social Security  Agency on people&rsquo;s entitlement, one can begin to model welfare and welfare  delivery in a way that reflects our particular circumstances.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Thirdly, I am not going to be behind the door on this  matter. I said to Lord Freud that in the final analysis, whatever about legal  and operational flexibility, in my view, the conditions in the North, the  particular circumstances that we face and the impact of need and disadvantage  on many people require financial intervention from London and from the Executive. That is why,  last week, I passed to the Executive a remedies paper that outlined to the  Executive interventions over the next four years funded at the Executive table  in order to mitigate the worst excesses of welfare reform and cuts that have  been visited on too many people in our community.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  Will you bring your proposals for mitigating some of the welfare reform issues  to your colleagues in the Executive Committee?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: As I indicated last week, I forwarded what I call a  remedies paper to my Executive colleagues. It scoped out general and particular  opportunities where the Executive could intervene financially to ease the  burden that is being created on too many people. However, in my view, the  moneys that we are talking about are of such a scale that they are beyond the  ability of the DSD alone to fund. Therefore, it will require an Executive decision  to fund. In my view, spending &pound;20 million a year easing the burden of people in  need, rather than spending &pound;20 million a year on a community renewal fund that  has been developed over the heads of Government and the community, is a much  better and wise investment by the Government.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>:  Does the Minister appreciate the fears of so many people who have serious  disabilities? They are frightened about what Christmas will bring for them.  Some of them are in wheelchairs. Does he accept the fact that the media present  those people as, in some way, claiming benefits to which they should not be  entitled and that genuine claimants, who are living with real disability and  facing an uncertain Christmas, are frightened and concerned, because they do  not know what they will be able to pay next year? The media are almost saying  that those people should not have been paid benefits in the first place.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I concur with that sentiment. Yesterday on &lsquo;Talkback&rsquo;,  Monica Wilson from Disability Action outlined how she thought that proposals  from London, including the disability living allowance (DLA) review, were  demoralising for people who, in many ways, are already in need and disadvantage  and under fear and uncertainty. I concur with her, as will the Member. The new  wave of reform will demoralise people and create the concern that the Member  identified: namely that some in the media will demonise people who are  legitimately on benefits.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">London has to face up to the  fact that, for example, 50,000 people in Northern Ireland receive DLA. For  reasons substantially beyond people&rsquo;s control, given their life experiences and  the legacy of conflict, they suffer from mental incapacity or trauma of one  sort or another. That is not a made-up figure or evidence of people abusing the  system; those people are in substantial need. Those circumstances need to be  recognised when it comes to DLA and other reforms being worked through.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: I  appreciate the fact that the Minister is going to and from Westminster  to speak on behalf of the people of Northern Ireland. However, he has  been going to Westminster  for some time and has been there on several occasions. As the Member who spoke  previously said, I do not want to raise false expectations for people. Will the  Minister outline the benefits on which he is seeking flexibility, and when we  will hear about them?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I want to say a number of things in relation to that  question. First, at least I continue to have a conversation with London. In some other  places, it seems that the conversation has gone quiet. At least Lord Freud, to  be fair to him, continues to have a conversation with me, and it is clear that  that conversation will continue. Secondly, some of the benefit changes and cuts  will impact very quickly, but it is planned that some of them will not be  imposed until 2013 or 2014. Universal credits and DLA reform, for example, are  within that timescale. I hope that the future Minister for Social Development,  whoever that might be, will continue to travel to London to put the case of  Northern Ireland&rsquo;s particular circumstances, because a case will have to be  made, year in, year out, as welfare reform proposals evolve, develop and are  legislated for. It is not a matter that will be resolved by me in the next  number of weeks; it is a matter that will have to be addressed by successive  Ministers and Governments in Northern    Ireland over the longer term.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will give one example of what will happen in the  immediate future. Lord Freud agreed with me that officials in my Department and  in the department for Work and Pensions would begin to work together through  the particular and general impact of the current welfare changes and cuts in Northern Ireland.  Lord Freud has had experience of Northern Ireland  during the years of conflict, and he has made assessments in that regard on how  it might apply to the Middle East. I have a  sense that he is beginning to apply his mind to our circumstances, and in that  space there may be an opportunity to answer Ms Lo&rsquo;s question positively.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Benefits</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">5. <strong>Mr  Armstrong </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development how many benefits are  administered by the Social Security Agency.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  708/11<a name="AQO708/11" id="AQO708/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: Eighteen benefits are administered by the Social  Security Agency.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Armstrong</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his very short answer. Does he acknowledge that the  agency administers too many benefits and that the system is not user-friendly  and is unnecessarily complicated?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for his question. As I keep saying,  I am a believer in reform. Northern    Ireland has done reform well, albeit slowly,  over the past 40 years. The proof is in this Chamber, in policing, in  employment, in equality and in housing. There is much reform that we need to  do. I am not opposed to reform. I believe in reform in a positive image.  Therefore, I will support anything that may simplify the benefits system or may  help people who are capable of work to get into work. However, the problem is  that much of what the Government are doing in London is cuts disguised as reform, which I  do not support. In our conditions in Northern Ireland, which I just  outlined, the impact on those in need and disadvantage will be disproportionate  and will go very deep. Although I support reform, including welfare reform, I  do not support how London  is pursuing it. I am very concerned that the scale of what is proposed &mdash; not a  week passes without a welfare reform initiative &mdash; will lead to the overload of  the system whereby the ambition of some in London  to reform will be too big, too far, too fast and too deep, with consequences  for those who are on benefits in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>:  Does the Minister agree that there is an over-complication of not only the  number of benefits but the forms that need to be filled in? Of the tens of  thousands of payments that were investigated by his Department, I think that  something like 60% had to be moved upwards due to mistakes by the applicants  and some staff in his Department.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I repeat that initiatives that can simplify welfare  application and the management of welfare are useful. However, we must be  careful to differentiate between simplification and an attempt to reduce the  welfare platform. If it is simplification, we could probably concur. However,  if it is changing processes to reduce the welfare platform to bring about cuts  that impact adversely on the lives of our communities and citizens, we need to  be very mindful and vigilant not to go down that road.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Mr Trevor Lunn is not in his place to ask question 6, and Mr Basil  McCrea is not in his place to ask question 7.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Housing: Private Sector Grants</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">8. <strong>Mr  Boylan </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development what budget was available  for private sector grants in the Newry area in the last financial year and how  much of that budget was spent.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  711/11<a name="AQO711/11" id="AQO711/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for his question. I confirm that, in  the 2009-2010 year, the Newry grants office budget for private sector grants  was &pound;4&middot;19 million. Actual expenditure was &pound;4&middot;65 million, which is 11&middot;1% greater  than the original figure.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. I thank the Minister for his answer. Will he continue with  routine maintenance in the Newry area, or does he propose to withdraw any  funding?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I have no proposals to withdraw any funding from any  area, including Newry. The maintenance budget going forward will be subject to  the Budget negotiations. In the fullness of time, we will see what that does or  does not reveal. I am committed to maintenance budgets in the Housing  Executive. I am not committed to multi-element improvements when it comes to  housing stock because the quality of our public housing in the Housing  Executive is of such a standard that multi-element schemes are not the way to go.  However, single-element schemes across a range of maintenance categories will  be part of the budget going forward, subject to whatever that budget may be.<span class="SectionMarker"><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></span></p>

    <p class="H4StageHeading">Autism Bill: Second Stage</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Debate resumed on motion:</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That the Second Stage of the Autism Bill [NIA 2/10] be  agreed. &mdash; [Mr D Bradley.]</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I support the principles set out  in the Bill and declare an interest as a member of the all-party Assembly group  on disability. In moving the Second Stage, Dominic Bradley set out the general  principles that are to be achieved through the Bill. I want to pick up and  expand on a few of those points, particularly about autism, autistic spectrum  disorder (ASD) and Asperger&rsquo;s syndrome and their effects and why early  intervention is important. I will pick up on the prevalence of the conditions  and on the equality agenda.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Autism is a neural development disability that affects the  areas of the brain responsible for social communication, imagination and social  interaction. Individuals with autism will have problems in one, two or all  three areas. Around 25% of people with ASD will have an accompanying learning  disability. Of those with autism, 75% have an IQ level of more than 70.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Asperger&rsquo;s syndrome is autism without a learning disability.  Individuals with Asperger&rsquo;s syndrome may have average or above-average  intelligence and may not have the language or speech problems of a person with  autism. However, they may have language or communication problems and  co-ordination and movement problems, as well as social difficulties,  particularly in comprehending social rules in relationships and situations.  That predisposes people with Asperger&rsquo;s syndrome to anxiety and stress  conditions that may require intervention. Mental health services lack the  expertise and confidence to provide an adequate and appropriate service for  people with ASD. Dominic Bradley referred to statistics that reflect the  association between mental health and autism, and I think that that should be  high on our agenda.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Dominic touched on prevalence rates, and it is startling  that 20,000 children and adults have autism. Five thousand of the children are  of school age. Each year, 300 children who will later be diagnosed with ASD are  born. The most startling statistic is that the number of children with ASD has  increased by 500% over the past seven years. People often say that the  disability is rare: it is not. It is one of the fastest growing developmental  disabilities, and a look at the statistics makes that clear. Four times more  males than females are affected by autism, and 25% of people with ASD have a  learning disability. Of those with ASD, approximately 75% fall outside the  current Department of Health programme of care model.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is no known cure for autism, but, with correct  intervention and support, individuals can have meaningful levels of  independence in their life, something that is at the heart of the legislation  being debated. Research suggests that there is no single cause of autism but  there is a physical problem that affects the parts of the brain that integrate  language and information processed from the senses. Autism has a physical &mdash; not  emotional &mdash; origin, and evidence regarding a genetic link to ASD is increasing.  There is an ongoing debate about the impact of environmental factors. Some  sources contend that the rapidly growing prevalence that we see today cannot be  due totally to better detection rates. There must be other factors.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Individuals with ASD have problems in three main areas, the  first of which is social interaction. For example, they may not want to  socialise or be with other people, or they may behave socially inappropriately  &mdash; &ldquo;naive&rdquo; may be another way to look at it. They have difficulty understanding  social rules, and that often brings people with ASD into conflict with the  public and the justice system. Yesterday, in the debate on early intervention,  all Members agreed that, often, the justice system deals with people who would  not be there, had there been proper intervention at an early stage in their  life.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The second area is social communication. Some individuals  may never speak any meaningful language, or they may have a functional  language, with no interest in making small talk. Some may engage in one-sided  interactions, such as talking for long periods about a subject of special  interest to them, with no awareness of the needs of the listener.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Imagination is the third area in which ASD prevails. Often,  children at the severe end of the spectrum will not play in a meaningful and  imaginative way. They may prefer to line up their toys according to size or  colour. Such individuals may not be able to imagine an alternative. They have  little tolerance for unexpected changes in any areas of their life and may be  driven to follow particular routines and be unable to accept change or be  flexible in their day-to-day life.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A person with autism will also experience sensory problems  with certain noises or a need for deep pressure. Individuals may also have  problems filtering out information; for example, a child may not be able to  ignore certain sounds or stimuli in the environment that they are in.  Individuals may also have a problem with organisation; for example, the child  may be highly intelligent but, regardless of their ability, may find it very  difficult to sequence putting on their clothes. That can seem unusual to others  who do not understand the condition and are not properly prepared for dealing  with such children, especially schools, teachers and support workers in  general.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">ASD affects the lives of people of all ages and levels of  ability. Popular culture often presents the perception that ASD is a condition  of childhood: that is not the case. However, it is often diagnosed in childhood  and is best diagnosed by a multidisciplinary team that assesses the child in a  variety of settings, for example, in the home, school and clinic. Each  professional will contribute to the overall diagnosis, from which a treatment  plan will be developed. The team is likely to be made up of a paediatrician, a  speech and language therapist, an occupational therapist, a clinical  psychologist and sometimes a specialist social worker. A child psychiatrist can  also often be in attendance. If symptoms are picked up on at school by a  teacher or classroom assistant, the child may be referred for an assessment by  an educational psychologist.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When queries are first raised about a child&rsquo;s difficulty in  social communication, even before diagnosis, it is important that advice is  sought. The months that parents spend waiting for a diagnosis can be put to  good use, reading about and becoming familiar with holistic intervention  programmes. I pay tribute to the many support organisations, such as Autism NI,  Parents&rsquo; Education as Autism Therapists, the Centre for Early Autism Treatment,  Autism Initiatives and the National Autistic Society. There are so many groups.  They do fantastic work and support parents who find themselves in a difficult  situation when they have recently had a diagnosis and are not sure where to  turn.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The other particularly difficult issue for those who have  ASD is managing transitions. Routine and predictability are very important to  people with ASD, and it can be difficult to interpret and make sense of social  rules and situations. It is vital that services plan and work together to  smooth the child&rsquo;s life transitions from preschool, along their school life and  into lifelong learning. Again, I point to the voluntary sector, which has  worked tirelessly with parents and those on the autistic spectrum to support  them and help them through those situations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Issues of equality have been raised around autism and  autism legislation as regards the creation of a hierarchy of disability and the  whole equality agenda. I do not believe that that is what we are doing through  this legislation. ASD is not recognised as a social and communicative  disability under the current Disability Discrimination Act. We looked to other  examples, and, in England,  the Government are repealing the Disability Discrimination Act and replacing it  or consulting on replacing it with the Equality Act 2010. The definition of  disability that will be contained in that legislation is out for consultation,  and we have a real chance here today to address the current inequality around  the fact that autism is not recognised. The Disability Discrimination Act  refers to physical and mental disability but not explicitly to communication  and social disability. This is our opportunity to address that inequality and to  make it right for all who are on the autistic spectrum.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There have been many developments in autism over the past  years, none less than the Department of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety&rsquo;s action plan, as well as the work of the community and voluntary sector  in supporting parents and those on the spectrum. There has been an increase in  funding from the Department of Health, and I fully recognise that. I also  welcome the development of the action plan and the new network where parents  are very much involved in progressing that plan.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Today&rsquo;s debate should not be a battle. We all want the same  outcome. We all want to improve the lives of people with autism. That needs to  be at the core of everything that we do today. Let us build on the good work that  has happened. This legislation is not taking away from that; it is enhancing it  and calling for more cross-departmental working.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Last but not least, I commend the work of parents. I have  met many parents since my election to this Assembly &mdash; parents who make sure  that we, as MLAs, are very much aware of the effects of autism on the  individual and on the entire family circle.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">With this legislation, we have a real opportunity to change  for the better the lives of those on the autistic spectrum. I look forward to  Committee Stage, and I know that the National Autistic Society has suggested an  amendment requiring more parental consultation in the strategy that we take  forward. I would not dispute that for a moment; it would be very positive.  Therefore, I look forward to Committee Stage and to ensuring that,  collectively, we improve the lives of those on the autistic spectrum.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  I would willingly support any measure that made the early diagnosis and  treatment of autism possible. Nevertheless, we need to see this measure in  context. On 29 November, the Health Minister, Michael McGimpsey, announced an  additional &pound;100,000 of funding for autism services in Northern Ireland.  That happened even though he was already involved in two major budgetary  battles with the Finance Minister. One of those battles related to local  budgetary cuts of &pound;370 million. Members will recall that the Health Minister  had to find &pound;113 million of that. The other battle was, of course, over the  comprehensive spending review cuts. The extra funding that the Minister  announced for autism will be used to develop specialist adult autism diagnostic  services. The new money was in addition to the extra investment of &pound;1&middot;54  million in autism services over 2009-2011, bringing the recurrent total new  investment to &pound;1&middot;64 million from April 2011.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At the same time that the Minister announced that extra  funding, he gave a guarantee that autism would be prioritised across all  Departments. The Minister also drew attention to the fact that waiting times for  an autism referral were reducing and that he was determined that no child  should have to wait longer than the current 13-week target for diagnostic  assessment. The Minister said that he believed that he already possessed all  the legislative authority he needed to make all necessary improvements in  autism services. He was able to say that because he controls social care as  well as healthcare &mdash; a combination of responsibilities that, in the United Kingdom, is unique to Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One thing that we must guard against is overlegislation.  The fact that we can legislate does not mean that, on every occasion, we should  legislate. Often, legislation imposes new and unavoidable costs on government,  and, of course, this is a time when we could do without additional costs. If  the Minister believes that he already possesses the relevant authority to  deliver, we need to ask whether new legislation is justified.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  The answer to that question is most definitely yes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On behalf of the Alliance Party, I support the Bill and  congratulate everyone involved in getting us to where we are today. It has been  an uphill battle. However, when something is right and people have fight in  their bellies, they do not lie down; they battle their way through many obstacles  and work with others, as far as possible, to arrive at a consensus, all to the  benefit, in this instance, of children and adults who have autism.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am delighted to be the Alliance Party&rsquo;s representative on  the all-party group on autism, and I pay tribute to its chairman, Mr Dominic  Bradley, who has played a pivotal role, along with others, in getting the  Autism Bill to its Second Stage in the Assembly today. I also pay tribute to  all the voluntary groups throughout Northern Ireland that have worked  with elected Members to convince us all of the need for an Autism Bill, despite  the reservations that have been expressed in some quarters.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is unfortunate that Northern Ireland is experiencing an  increase in the incidence of autism among youngsters who, inevitably, will grow  to become adults and seniors. The Assembly must accept what is happening and  make the necessary arrangements to ensure that everyone with autism has exactly  the same rights and expectations as everyone else. It is unfortunate that, more  often than not, people with autism and their parents and guardians have to  fight for everything when it comes to health, education, social development and  so on. Why should that happen? Like the rest of us, people with autism have  normal everyday needs and ambitions. That is why we need an Autism Bill, so  that, as a statutory requirement, everyone will receive their entitlement. It  is outrageous that, at present, parents and guardians, with so much caring and  watching to do, have to spend much valuable time getting what is theirs simply  as of right. I speak with the knowledge of having been through something  similar.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Autism Bill has the support of the vast majority of  groups engaged in promoting the wishes and needs of the ASD voluntary sector.  The strategic action plan put forward by the Department of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety falls far short of what is required. The Autism Bill  will direct the formation of a cross-departmental approach to ASD by requiring  the development of a cross-departmental strategy for autism.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The evidence presented in the Assembly all-party group on  autism&rsquo;s briefing paper was overwhelmingly in favour of progressing with the  Bill. As has already been said, a petition of support, signed by thousands of  campaigners, was presented to all the political parties and the Northern  Ireland Local Government Association. All 26 local councils, as far as I know,  supported positive motions in favour of an Autism Bill. Most of the political  parties have signed up to support the Bill. Many families, who are at the  coalface of the autism spectrum, have supported the Bill. Indeed, in  preparation for next year&rsquo;s Assembly elections, parties are registering ASD as  a priority. I say loud and clear today that the Alliance Party is 100% behind  the need for an Autism Bill without delay. We will have that in our party  manifesto and will work tirelessly in the new mandate to see that the Bill is  brought to fruition. I hope that other parties will do the same.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When the Assembly signs off on this important Bill, the  people most in need of legislation will see a lifelong strategy adopted that  places the welfare of people with autism and their families at its centre. The  Autism Bill will provide for an Executive-sponsored ASD awareness campaign that  will include a first awareness level of training for senior civil servants. All  Departments will have to address the impact of legislative change on their  policies, practices and provision. The Bill will have a real and positive  effect on families. It will assure parents and guardians that, at last, the  Executive recognise the lifelong and whole-life reality of ASD; that ASD is a  shared responsibility in our community; that duplication and confusion can be  addressed; and that transactions that are distressing for individuals with  autism can be planned and resourced.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We all want a better life for all our constituents, and the  Autism Bill will, when it becomes law, help to do just that. The Alliance Party  supports the Second Stage of the Bill and looks forward to its early  progression and, indeed, its implementation at a later date.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  I rise as a member of the all-party group on autism to support the Second Stage  of the Bill. The chairman of the group earlier explained some of the thinking  behind the Bill and set out clearly the nature of autism or, as it is known,  ASD, and the types of challenges that it presents to us all. It is a complex  issue, and I am conscious that there are many variations to what we broadly define  as autism.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The work that has been done on the Bill so far and the  investigations into the issues that surround it have certainly provided an  insight into the many problems faced by parents and those who suffer from  autism, and I have no doubt whatsoever that there is a real need for this  legislation. The all-party group is agreed on the need for the Bill, which has  received considerable support across the board, and we are keen for it to  progress as quickly as is practically possible. The group&rsquo;s consultation in  March revealed an 80% approval rating for the legislation, and, as has been  said around the House already today &mdash; it bears repetition &mdash; NILGA and all the  26 councils have indicated their support for the Bill. Independent research  reports are also very supportive. However, like most draft legislation, the  Bill is not perfect. Further issues will need to be addressed, but it marks a  significant start, takes us on a journey down the right road and focuses our  attention on the need to deliver for those who suffer from autistic disorder.  We might help to change their lives and provide a better lifestyle for them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will set out a few key arguments in favour of the Bill.  The Bill has two main aims. First, it seeks to amend the Disability  Discrimination Act 1995 to resolve any ambiguity as to whether the term  &ldquo;disability&rdquo; applies to autistic spectrum conditions. Secondly and very  importantly, it makes the preparation and implementation of an autism strategy  a requirement. That is long overdue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Disability Discrimination Act 1995, as it stands, does  not recognise ASD. The Act is quite prescriptive. It defines disability as  physical or mental, and the latter includes learning disability and mental  illness. That seems fairly comprehensive but, although some argue that it  should fit into the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, the reality is that ASD  does not fall into any of those categories. In practice, that legal ambiguity  has an adverse impact on those who suffer from autism, those who care for them  and those who represent them, such as the Commissioner for Children and Young  People, the Equality Commission and the Children&rsquo;s Law Centre. The Disability  Discrimination Act 1995 and the guidance issued under it means that it is  difficult, if not impossible, for a person with autism to qualify for benefits  such as disability living allowance.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Autism is the fastest-growing neuro-developmental  disability in modern society. It is a neurological condition with a biological  cause that can be traced to trauma to a specific brain function. It is defined  as a social and communication disability. Therefore, to ensure that autism is  included in the 1995 Act, the Bill inserts the words &ldquo;social (including  communication)&rdquo;. Of course, some will say that that opens the door to the  inclusion of an almost endless range of groups and categories. I understand  that view, but I do not think that such concerns will be realised. It is worth  noting that, in 2006, the definition of &ldquo;disability&rdquo; was amended so that anyone  with cancer, MS or HIV is now deemed disabled from the point of diagnosis  rather than from the point at which the condition starts to have a substantial  and adverse effect on a person&rsquo;s ability to carry out normal day-to-day  activities. In a sense, therefore, a precedent for the amendment that is before  the House has been set. The change to the definition will give long overdue  legal recognition to a condition that is still treated with a high degree of  suspicion and scepticism by some professionals and agencies. It will be of  considerable help to the various public bodies in their decision-making and in  providing guidance.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are many examples of those with autism suffering from  discrimination and not being treated with the respect that they deserve. Take,  for example, a pupil who faces disciplinary proceedings for breaching a school  code. If his or her behaviour is caused by ASD that has not been diagnosed,  recognised or treated in the proper fashion, it seems most unfair for that  pupil to be punished for something beyond his or her control. A change to the  legislation, along with greater clarity in the guidance, will ensure that that  pupil&rsquo;s autistic disorder is fully recognised.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The proposed change to the Act will also help families,  many of whom have battled for years to gain some sort of recognition for the  autistic disorder. We hope that the Bill will go a long way to achieving that.  Significantly, too, it will signal the end of discrimination against those who  have autism but have an IQ of over 70 and who, therefore, currently fall  between a number of stools.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The other major change that the Bill will bring about is  that it will direct the development of a cross-departmental strategy for  autism. At present, Departments are under no legal obligation to do that, and  we simply rely on the goodwill of Ministers and officials. I fully accept that  the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety is aware of the  need for action. Indeed, it already has in place an action plan, to which a  Member who spoke earlier referred. However, its plan does not work for people  who suffer from an autistic disorder. The Department of Education is also aware  of the importance of the issue but, again, is doing nothing to deliver for  those who suffer from the condition. It would make much more sense, therefore,  for the key Departments to co-operate rather than developing separate policies.  In times of limited funding, it is more vital than ever to minimise duplication  and to maximise effectiveness and efficiency. We must try to break out of the  traditional silo mentality of the Civil Service. The Bill also provides for a  government-sponsored autism awareness campaign that includes awareness training  for civil servants. In the current climate of economic constraint, it is  incumbent on us all to plan smartly for future challenges. With the Bill, we  have made an important start. It presents us with challenges but also with many  opportunities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Most if not all Members around the Chamber today have been  faced by parents in their constituency offices who have children with an  autistic disorder. They are of preschool age, primary-school age, at high  school or college or even in the workplace. Some of their disorders, however,  have not been recognised, and others are on huge waiting lists to have their  problems and difficulties diagnosed. The process seems to go on endlessly. That  is why the Bill must go through the House today. The legislation is important  in helping those who have suffered in silence. I encourage the House to support  the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat a LeasCheann Comhairle. I am also a member of the all-party  Assembly group on autism. I apologise for missing some of its meetings. I pay  tribute to the sponsor of the Bill and chairperson of the group for bringing  the legislation to the Floor today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members talked about over-legislating, but this is an  important piece of legislation, which we need to put through the Assembly to  ensure that the rights of people on the autism spectrum are protected and that  they get the resources that they deserve. I thank Research Services for its  paper on the Bill, and I thank Arlene Cassidy and all the people who have  worked to deliver a service to people on the autism spectrum in the absence of  a properly funded model.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will not rehash what most Members have said, but there  are two key issues to do with the Bill. First, the Bill proposes to amend the  Disability Discrimination Act 1995, and it is time that we ended the  discrimination against people with autism. It proposes the insertion of the  words &ldquo;social&rdquo;, &ldquo;social interaction&rdquo;, which includes communication, and  &ldquo;forming social relationships&rdquo;. That will ensure that all forms of autism will  get their recognition.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will talk from a personal point of view. My colleague  Michelle O&rsquo;Neill talked about social interaction. People with autism may not  want to socialise or be with other people, and they may behave in socially  inappropriate or naive ways. Difficulties in the area of social communication  mean that some individuals may never speak any meaningful language. A further  area is imagination, and children with difficulties in that area may not play  in a meaningful and imaginative way.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That rings true for me, because I have experienced that  with my nephew. Around 15 years ago, that lad was diagnosed with autism. The  research paper describes exactly what was happening. I used to buy a Thomas the  Tank Engine toy because that was what the young lad wanted all the time. It was  easy for me to buy birthday and Christmas presents because he related to that  toy all the time. Fifteen years later, I see that experience written in the  paper. People need to be there and to experience it, and, if the Assembly were  to do that, it would ensure that the legislation went through to protect those  people and give them every opportunity. That lad is 15 years old, and  thankfully, he is a clever young lad, and he comes from a good, caring home. He  gets the best of care, and he is doing very well. I hope that he continues to  do so.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The second aspect of the Bill is the requirement for a  strategy. The strategy must look at early intervention. Information from Autism  NI states:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Autism is best diagnosed by a multidisciplinary  team&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is correct. When I think back to the early  days when it was discovered in the family, there was early intervention from  teachers in schools and from elsewhere, and people gave their opinion. The  strategy must produce a proper way of looking forward and of providing guidance  to ensure that early intervention happens.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The strategy should also look at the parents, carers and  the family. People do not realise the strain, stress and trauma that families  experience. For people who are not connected and who do not see it at first  hand, I have another paper that identifies clearly what happens. Fifty per cent  of parents are on long-term medication; 65% report illness linked to caring;  80% of families report feeling overwhelmed and helpless; and 57% of families  report acute anxiety and panic attacks. There is a whole raft of issues, and I  want the strategy to provide for the carers to be looked after and for a  respite element. I do not want to go down the line that those families want a  break away, but they need some respite and some time away.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Dominic Bradley also mentioned cost. He did so in the right  context. There is no way that a cost can be put on that. It is extremely  difficult for someone to look after a child or adult with autistic spectrum  disorder (ASD). I do not want anyone to get up and say that it is a matter of  cost. I believe that in 2009, the Minister allocated &pound;100,000 for a period of  this year. I thank the Minister for that &pound;100,000. However, a great deal more  is needed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have mentioned costs in one respect, however, an element  of the budget and a proper funding package will be identified through this  legislation that will help people with autistic spectrum disorder and their  carers. I fully support the Bill&rsquo;s principles. I hope that the Assembly will  stand up, take notice and pass this piece of legislation. Any secondary measures  flowing from it need to be written up now, so that they will be ready when the  Bill is passed.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>: I  support the Bill. I speak as a member of the all-party working group on autism.  The first part of the Bill amends the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. The  second part deals with the development of an autism strategy. I welcome the  Bill&rsquo;s Second Stage. It has been a long time coming, and I am pleased that it  has come before the House.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause one amends the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. Autism  is not covered by the 1995 Act, and a number of Members have reiterated that  fact. ASD is recognised in disability legislation in other parts of the United Kingdom; therefore, it is important that Northern Ireland falls into line with the rest  of the UK.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some people might ask why ASD should be covered. The  majority of disabilities are already covered by section 1(1) of the Disability  Discrimination Act 1995, and they include physical and mental conditions, such  as learning disabilities, mental illness, cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis,  visual impairment, schizophrenia, et cetera. All of those conditions are  already recognised; however, ASD and associated problems are not. ASD is  neither a physical nor mental disability.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The impact of its current status on ASD sufferers is as  follows. If someone has ASD and a learning disability, that person receives  services from the learning disability sector, which leaves 75% of people with  ASD outside those services. If someone has ASD and a mental illness, that person  receives services from the mental health sector. If someone has ASD and a  visual or hearing impairment, that person receives services from the latter  sector. Shockingly, someone with ASD who has an IQ above 70, or who is an  adult, or both, has no entitlement to services.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Prevalence levels have reached what is described as the  &ldquo;tipping balance&rdquo;. Now, more people in Northern Ireland are diagnosed with  ASD than with learning disabilities. There are now 5,000 school-age children  with ASD, compared to 900 in 2002. More people are diagnosed with ASD than the  combined total of people with multiple sclerosis, Down&rsquo;s syndrome and  Parkinson&rsquo;s disease.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mothers of children with ASD show higher levels of stress  than mothers of children with other disabilities. Several Members have  mentioned that in the debate. Having met some of those parents and their  children at a summer scheme in 2009, I can, certainly, confirm that that stress  is a fact. I witnessed a child physically attack their mother several times  purely because they had been taken out of their routine.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It was amazing to see the patience shown by those parents  and how they dealt with that situation. One can understand the stress that that  causes to those parents, and I was not surprised when I found out that 80% of  mothers of children with ASD take antidepressants.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Significant numbers of people in our prisons have been  diagnosed with ASD. That is not to say that that is the main cause for their  being in prison, but that condition should have been dealt with long before  they reached that stage. That is all very concerning and some of the statistics  are also a cause for concern.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 3(1) states:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The autism strategy must set out how the needs of  persons with autism are to be addressed throughout their lives.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">In a lifelong approach, the points of transition in  an individual&rsquo;s life are prioritised in all strategies and action plans. It  appears that it is in the area of transition that the cross-cutting nature of  services and co-operation between Departments, government agencies and  voluntary and community groups becomes most important. Transitions are  particularly difficult for those with ASD to manage, because routine and  predictability, which help them to learn, interpret and make sense of social  rules and situations, are not always there. It is vital that services plan and  work together to smooth life transitions from preschool to lifelong learning.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We can debate the issue until the cows come home, but,  quite frankly, unless we have a child with ASD, none of us will fully  understand the impact of the Bill on families in Northern Ireland. It is unfortunate  for those families that we live in a part of the United Kingdom that discriminates  against a group of individuals who fall outside the existing legislation. It is  good that the Bill will rectify that situation, and I commend it to the House.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  The Ulster Unionist Party welcomes the Bill and looks forward to scrutinising  it during its Committee Stage. Members will be aware that the UUP has long been  involved in this important issue and has taken a lead role in promoting  services for those who are affected by autism in the Departments that it looks  after. The UUP is an advocate and a promoter of services for autism in Northern Ireland,  and the party feels that it is leading the way.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My colleague from Upper Bann  mentioned the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety&rsquo;s input  into the strategy that he brought forward and the additional &pound;100,000 that he  has made available for autism services. I am also pleased to report that in the  Department for Employment and Learning, UUP Ministers introduced innovative  ways to help those with health conditions, including ASD, to find some form of  training and employment that is suitable to their needs.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>: I  agree with the Member&rsquo;s point about the additional &pound;100,000 being made  available. However, does he not agree that it is about time that legislation is  put in place, with a set budget and funding stream, to address the needs of the  autistic spectrum?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I thank the Member for his point; it brings me on nicely to an issue that I was  going to raise. In Mr Boylan&rsquo;s earlier contribution, he said that the issue is  not about costs. However, if we are looking for separate funding streams &mdash;  presumably, additional funding streams, otherwise there is no point in doing it  &mdash; the money will have to come from somewhere, and it is difficult to see which  Department will have money taken from it to provide for this very needy case.  That is because, on three separate occasions, the Member&rsquo;s party voted for cuts  in the health budget. When it comes to issues of budgets and finding more money  to pay for autism services, the Assembly must realise &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I will give way in a moment, when I have finished. When the Assembly calls for  more services, they should be properly costed, and we must also work out how we  are going to target the resources in the right way. We will have an informed  discussion during the Bill&rsquo;s Committee Stage to ensure that we are doing the  right thing. I will now give way to the Member.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  I look forward to that Committee Stage. However, when every Department becomes  involved in a cross-departmental approach, surely they should bring their  funding streams to the table as well as their contributions.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I thank the Member for her contribution. That raises the issue of the  Department of Education, which she will know something about because she serves  with me on the Committee for Education. There seems to be some divergence of  strategies, which we should address. Members have raised concerns repeatedly  about whether the investment that we make in Middletown really solves the issues that we  want to be dealing with. So, I certainly look forward to Ministers and  Departments co-operating properly, as they should do of right, to deal with  that matter.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  On the development of strategies, and given your statement that the UUP will  scrutinise the legislation, can we also have a commitment that unlike at least  one other party you will not use a petition of concern to prevent good  legislation coming to the Floor of the Chamber?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I assure you that our aim is to make sure that we get good legislation. I  concur that petitions of concern should be used for the purpose for which they  were intended, and not for other reasons.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are concerned about certain issues in the Bill. I was  taken by what Mr Craig said. I, too, have met the parents of children with  autism at summer schools, in their houses and at other places. One cannot help  but be impressed by their resilience and fortitude in carrying on and dealing  with those things. However, there are very real challenges. Frankly, I will not  repeat some of the issues and conditions, because they are distressing.  However, I can tell you that they had a very personal impact on me.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I accept absolutely that there are people with a very  serious condition who are not yet identified within a statutory framework. The  problem with how we fix that is as follows: can we legislate our way out of it?  Can we have something that is on a spectrum? How does one define it?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I listened to the proposer of the motion, Mr Bradley, talk  about some of the issues that identify people on the autistic spectrum. I agree  that difficulty with social skills and interacting with people are determining  factors. However, those are not exclusive to people with that condition. Were  the matter not so serious, I might talk about people in the immediate vicinity  who have those issues. The point that I want to make without undue levity is  the difficulty in constraining a condition that is on a spectrum. There is a  question of whether we disassemble the argument that is being put forward.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Since the Member met the parents of children with autism, the children  themselves, and others, he will probably be aware that there is quite a  stringent diagnostic process to go through before a person is deemed to be at  this or that point on the spectrum. So, it is not the case that people will  come along without stringent and professional diagnosis.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am glad that the Member mentioned the positive  contribution that the UUP made to the autism debate and to services. I welcome  that, and remind him that his colleagues Mr McCallister and Mr Savage supported  the Bill at the beginning. That was very welcome as well.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I direct the Member&rsquo;s attention to a 2010 paper from the Assembly  Research and Library Service entitled &lsquo;Autism Bill&rsquo;, which states:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;In spite of the existing guidance and case law,  meeting the definition of disability contained in the DDA is likely to continue  to present challenges to those with autistic spectrum disorders. The Bill seeks  to amend the DDA in a way which widens the scope of the existing definition in  a way which would encompass autistic spectrum conditions.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In order for discrimination against autistic spectrum  conditions to end, it is necessary to amend the legislation. That is one of the  main aims of the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I thank the Member for his comprehensive intervention. I spoke to Mr  McCallister today &mdash; I know that Mr Savage will support this &mdash; and he was most  insistent that I should be here because, unfortunately, he cannot make it. I  assure the Member that Mr McCallister is absolutely committed to dealing with  the serious issues that have been raised. Not only have I met families and  people that are on the autistic spectrum; I have also engaged, as has Mr  McCallister, with Autism NI, Arlene Cassidy, Eileen Bell and a number of other  people.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member will, of course, acknowledge that there are a  significant number of bodies that seek to address the issue and that there is a  diversity of views about the best way forward. It is with that in mind that we  look forward to the Committee Stage of the Bill, when we can identify the best  way forward.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  The Member is correct: there is quite a wide range of advocacy groups for  people with autism, but all of those groups, as Michelle O&rsquo;Neill pointed out  earlier, are of one mind about the necessity for legislation. What they differ  about are the interventions that are most effective, and that is an issue that  I will leave to them.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I thank the Member for that. The House will properly give the legislation due  scrutiny. The issue, which I am sure the Member will acknowledge is at least a  consideration for us all, is that there is a wide variety of conditions, not  all of which have their own Bill. People will look at us to see what way we  approach the issue. That may well be the appropriate thing to do, but there are  other issues that will come along. We are a relatively young and immature  legislative Assembly, so it is appropriate that we do not make rash decisions  that actually have implications.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I will, but I want to finish with one last thing. Go ahead.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>: I  thank the Member for giving way. The Member talks about the immaturity of this  House, but will he acknowledge that the Mother of Parliaments has already  passed legislation on this issue? It is wrong to say that there are no  legislative criteria out there when the Mother of Parliaments at Westminster can pass  legislation on the issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We can talk in circles for ages on the issue, but will he  recognise that the Bill will do away with a discriminatory factor in respect of  autism and ASD, in that it is not properly defined in existing legislation and  there are individuals who keep falling outside the scope of that legislation?  We are correcting discrimination. That is why the debate about cost is  secondary. There may be such implications, but they will have to be dealt with  in another debate.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I thank the Member for his intervention. I will deal with those points in  reverse order. There are cost implications. I have absolute respect and support  for people who are struggling in some very trying situations. The Member has  met the same people that I have, but there are implications and we, as an  Assembly, need to make sure that we are aware of exactly what they are. In  relation to his earlier point about legislation at Westminster, he will, no doubt, be aware that  there are different conditions and different strategies over there, and that  what was appropriate over there may not necessarily be appropriate here.</p>
    <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Molloy] in the Chair)</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">We will look at those issues at Committee Stage. I  will pose a question to the Minister, and perhaps he will deal with it. He  knows that, in another place, I have an interest in human rights. I want to  ensure that the Bill is compliant with the European Convention on Human Rights,  and we must check whether the Bill is competent. I also have some reservations  about whether it is compliant with section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998.  We must address those issues, and I do not express a view one way or the other.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Earlier, we spoke about people with different views. People  have concerns about those issues, and it is right that we address those  concerns. Professor Brice Dickson, the former chief commissioner of the  Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, had this to say:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Autism is a very wide spectrum and to say that  everyone who has autistic tendencies is disabled &hellip; would be going I think  probably too far.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  I explained to the Member that the Bill does not, as it were, allow in everyone  with autistic tendencies, and stringent diagnostic hurdles must be got over  before someone is included.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member rightly cautions the Assembly in its infancy to  be careful about how it legislates. However, I point out to him that the  Disability Discrimination Act was amended previously to include cancer, HIV and  multiple sclerosis. The floodgates were evidently manageable on those  occasions, and I do not see why they will not be so on this issue.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I make it clear to the Member, as he has intervened on a number of occasions,  that I am not in any way opposing the treatment of, or provision of services  for, autism. I do not argue that changes will not be necessary or are  impossible. I merely point out that, as a competent legislative Assembly, we  ought to look at such issues to ensure that anything that we do is properly  costed and has the intended results, and that we are not capable of doing the  things that we want to do in a different or better way. That seems to be the  appropriate way for a legislative Assembly to progress, and I look forward to  dealing with such issues at Committee Stage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I warned &mdash; I meant it in the gentlest of ways &mdash; that we are  all here because we represent people and want to do the best for them,  particularly for the people in most need. The danger for all of us is that we  attempt to boil an ocean. We must not do that. We need targeted intervention  for those who are most in need. I am sure that I am not alone in suggesting  that that is the right way forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not want to say much more, but I want to bring out a  few points. The Department argued that the cost of introducing the legislation  is money that could be better spent on front line services such as attacking  waiting lists. We have to consider the issue in the round. Are we doing right  by everyone in our entire society? There may be issues about additional  funding. I know that Members made genuine and positive interventions, and I was  touched by the contributions. However, we cannot cut the health budget and then  tell the Department that, by the way, it needs to do more. We have to address  that issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I conclude my contribution by saying that I welcome the  Bill&rsquo;s introduction. I look forward to an informed and reasonable discussion at  Committee Stage. I am committed to the issue of resolving autism and helping  those who do not get the services that they desire. I realise the problems that  are pushed on them. I recognise that it is not only those children or adults  who have autism who need help but those who care for them; that was mentioned  by other Members. There is a need for respite and for the care of other  children who may be involved. I am aware of a range of issues, and I am  personally involved. I want to ensure that we do it right. We have to get it  right for the people whom we are trying to serve.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  I am delighted to be participating in this debate, which is hugely important  for so many people across Northern    Ireland. I thank my party colleague Dominic  Bradley for his passion, commitment and dedication to the matter, which is very  close to his heart. I also thank all the members of the all-party group on  autism. It was right to bring forward legislation that will end, once and for  all, discrimination against so many people across Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Autistic spectrum disorder is widely recognised in the  Chamber as a serious and complex spectrum of conditions. Despite recent focus  on the disorder, there is no doubt that the necessary structured services have  not been in place to ensure that people with ASD, their families and carers  have a reasonable standard of life. The SDLP supports the Bill, because it will  remove ambiguity about the status of the condition as defined in the Disability  Discrimination Act 1995 and will ensure that the social impairment is  specifically recognised in law as a disability.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP is concerned, as are many other groups and  individuals, about the fact that failed cross-departmental action has resulted  in inadequate services for people with ASD, their families and carers. The SDLP  and others have, therefore, concluded that to ensure that there is a much more  co-ordinated cross-departmental approach to providing the necessary services,  there must be a statutory obligation on Departments to deliver. Given the  cross-cutting nature of the ASD strategy, it is much more likely to be delivered  effectively if it is backed up by legislation. The Bill will create a  cross-departmental statutory responsibility to deliver an autism strategy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that, through constituency work, all Members have  met carers of people with ASD who are burned out and deeply frustrated by a  system that delivers only in parts. In many cases, carers are close to  breakdowns, because, after years of caring, they are no longer able to cope  with the emotional and psychological damage. The lack of proper support for  many people with autism has led to unnecessary mental health breakdowns and  terrible living conditions for people who, in many cases, could live fairly  independent lives with some support.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">People with ASD, of whom there are many in our communities,  need particular help at transitional points in their lives and a highly  structured environment and routine to function effectively. Those transitional  points include moving from primary to secondary school; leaving the parental  home to living independently post-school age; moving from education to  employment; and continuing lifelong education. Parents are often very worried  about the ability of their autistic child to cope after either one or both of  them has passed on.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a lot of concern that many people, particularly  adults, are living with autism without being diagnosed. Given the number of  children now being diagnosed, it seems very likely that many adults have been  undiagnosed and are, therefore, vulnerable and living impaired lives. Such  people are liable to suffer all kinds of abuse. There is little doubt that the  underlying cause of mental health problems suffered by many people in  psychiatric care is autism. There is also little doubt that many people in  prison have, as an underlying condition, autism and had there been earlier  intervention, they may not have ended up in the situation in which they now  find themselves. We need to ensure that, as part of the strategy, proper audits  are carried out so that the number and circumstances of people with ASD is widely  known.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that I put on record some examples of the  cases in my consistency. I recently met a mother in my office who is at the age  at which most people should be looking forward to retirement and to beginning  to take life somewhat easier. However, she has a grown-up son with autism and  is on the edge of mental and physical breakdown because of her constant,  virtually round-the-clock work to try to care for her son. She should not be  taking antidepressants. She should be getting adequate support to look after  the son whom she loves and to maintain her physical and mental health. If  anything happened to her, her son would probably have to be institutionalised,  which is her big worry and concern. The state would then have to take on all  his care needs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, even from a pragmatic perspective, it makes  sense that that mother should get the help that she needs now. It is a terrible  indictment of our statutory system that she has to turn to elected  representatives to get the help that she needs to care for her son. What is  terribly worrying is that there many people who do not seek that help and are  living with that burden, day in, day out.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP honestly and honourably supports the Bill. We will  try to ensure that the social impairment that results from autistic spectrum  disorder is defined as a disability and that there will be clear statutory  responsibilities across a number of Departments in the formation, periodic  reviews and, most importantly, delivery of the autism strategy. The SDLP  supports the Bill, but we need to ensure proper support and a decent life for  so many people.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Over recent weeks, I have received e-mails and telephone  calls, and people have called into my office appealing to me directly, to make  sure that I support the Autism Bill. Those are cries from people&rsquo;s hearts,  whose family members may have passed on. They want to ensure that, for future  generations, we have a proper anti-discrimination and equality law that will  protect other children as they grow up.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  Like most other Members, I support the Bill. As a member of the all-party group  on autism, I am delighted that we are here today for the Bill&rsquo;s Second Stage.  That is a welcome development, and I have no doubt that the Bill&rsquo;s  implementation will result in delivering positive change for people with ASD. I  particularly welcome the fact that the Bill will require the establishment of a  cross-departmental approach to ASD.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 3(1) states:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The autism strategy must set out how the needs of  persons with autism are to be addressed throughout their lives.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">A lifelong approach and the points of transition in  an individual&rsquo;s life are prioritised in all the strategies and action plans. It  appears that it is in that area of transitions that the cross-cutting nature of  services and co-operation between Departments, agencies, and voluntary and  community groups becomes most important.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Transitions are particularly difficult for people with ASD  to manage because routine and predictability help them to learn, to interpret  and to make sense of social rules and situations. It is vital that services  plan and work together to smooth life transitions from preschool to lifelong  learning. Such a strategy is vital for people with autism. It is the missing  piece of the puzzle for many sufferers of ASD. A lifelong approach that  stretches beyond health and social care into education is vital for young  people with autism. I believe that we need legislation in order to see action  on a cross-departmental strategy. That is included in the legislation, and we  need the buy-in of all Departments to deliver effective and fair services for  sufferers and their carers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In recent years, autism has been underfunded. I welcome the  Minister&rsquo;s commitment to autism, and even on Twitter, he has committed to  providing funding for autism, but I do not believe that that is enough. I do  not wish to get into political point-scoring in respect of who provides the  money and matters like that, but I believe that people who suffer from autism,  their families, carers and friends all want an Autism Bill. Many people feel  that there is no co-operation between education and health, and that is what we  hope to change in the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill will ensure that data collection on ASD will be  required and must be synchronised across Departments. That will inform existing  and future planning of services and resource allocation. Currently, ASD data  collection in the health and social care sector is manual-dependent. The Bill  provides for a lifelong strategy that places the welfare of families at the  centre and a government-sponsored ASD awareness campaign, including a first  awareness level of training for civil servants.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The historic failure to recognise ASD has resulted in a  tragic legacy of underfunding across Departments. As the amendment to DDA takes  effect, all Departments will inevitably have to address the impact of  legislative change to their policies, practice and provision. Clause 3 creates  the requirement to undertake that exercise together in an effort to minimise  duplication and maximise effectiveness.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In this climate of economic constraint, it is important and  incumbent on all of us to play smartly for future challenges. Not only is  cross-departmental commitment to joint planning for ASD good practice, it is an  opportunity to look afresh at the resources that we have and how they can be  used or redeployed while, at the same time, challenging all Departments to work  innovatively with the voluntary sector to maximise the accountability,  flexibility and creativity of all sectors.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill will make a real difference for families. This  measure assures families that government recognises the lifelong and whole-life  reality of ASD. It gives assurance of the potential of service development in  harsh economic times through shared funding initiatives across Departments. The  Bill makes it clear that ASD is a shared responsibility in our community.  Duplication and confusion can, therefore, be addressed and transitions better  planned, managed and resourced.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have heard Members refer to constituency cases. All  Members have had constituents come to their offices and speak to them about  dealing with issues in respect of education and health. I do not want to pick  out an individual case, but my staff and I are there to help people in as best  a way as we can. Tragically, however, we have to help people in circumstances  like this too often, instead of having things in place so that they do not have  to go to their elected representative.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In an intervention during Basil McCrea&rsquo;s contribution, my  colleague referred to the legislation that went through the House of Commons. I  believe that it was Cheryl Gillan, a Conservative MP, who brought the private  Member&rsquo;s Bill through the House of Commons. It has gone through that process,  and it received Royal Assent on 12 November 2009. The House of Commons welcomed  the Bill. In fact, I believe that there was no disagreement when the Bill was  finally put. It is good that most Members across the House can join together,  right a wrong and give families, carers and those who suffer from ASD a future  that removes any discrimination outside of the Disability Discrimination Act  1995 and ensures that people with autism have rights equal to those of every  other person. I support the Bill, and I hope that all Members will do likewise.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>: I  rise to support the Bill, which has been a long time in coming. For too long,  people with ASD have been left behind. They were left out of the Disability  Discrimination Act 1995 and healthcare initiatives here. To be fair to the  Minister, he has increased funding, and Mr Gardiner and Basil McCrea mentioned  the &pound;100,000. We would like to see more than that invested in autism. That is  why the Bill will create a joined-up approach from different Departments, which,  I hope, will lead eventually to more funding coming from other Departments.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  For the record, the Minister produced an extra &pound;2&middot;02 million to underpin the  three-year action plan. Only last week, he announced a further &pound;100,000.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>: I  thank the Member for his intervention. It is good that he is blowing the  Minister&rsquo;s trumpet. Funding levels have increased.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Last year, the Minister of Health, Social Services and  Public Safety published a regional strategy that took account of contact and  networking among all those who represent people with ASD to improve and advance  services. The Autism Bill adds to the regional strategy and enhances it  substantially.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Currently, 20,000 adults and children who live in Northern Ireland  have autism, and more than 5,000 children suffer from autism. The number of  individuals who suffer from autism exceeds the combined number of those with  Down&rsquo;s syndrome, Parkinson&rsquo;s disease and multiple sclerosis, as was mentioned  by my colleague Mr Craig. In addition, 25% of those who suffer from autism have  a learning disability. The remaining 75%, therefore, fall outside the DHSSPS  programme of care model. ASD falls outside the Disability Discrimination Act  1995, so the amendment to include &ldquo;social (including communication)&rdquo; in the DDA  is welcome. All other regions of the UK  have implemented changes to DDA to take that into account, so it is vital that  we fall in line with the rest of the UK.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 2 relates to the development of a strategy for  autism. That is important, as other parts of the UK have had strategies in place for  some time, so we have been lagging behind. Wales is recognised as the first  country in the world to have established a cross-cutting national strategy  action plan for autism. That cross-departmental strategy is aimed at driving  improvements for children, young people and adult services in health, social  services and education. With it has come a significant level of investment in  services and care for those with ASD. The Bill ensures that the Department will  prepare a strategy on autism and will publish it not less than two years after  the Bill&rsquo;s passing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 3 refers to the content of the strategy. It must set  out how the needs of persons with autism are to be addressed throughout their  lives, and that is vital. The strategy also has to reach across Departments,  including the Department of Education, as provision for children with autism in  our schools is required to facilitate a life plan.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The heart of the strategy must set out how the needs of families  and carers of persons with autism are to be addressed. The Bill also requests  that staff in the Northern Ireland Civil Service who deal directly with the  public are given autism awareness training, which is vital. It is important  that we raise awareness of those who suffer from autism, as it is a life  illness that affects a person&rsquo;s ability to speak and to communicate clearly as  well as to concentrate. It is vital that we address the needs of those who  suffer from autism and work to better their care and lives as well as those of  their carers.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  I join the Member in welcoming the additional &pound;100,000 that the Minister  announced about a week ago to develop specialist adult diagnostic services, but  very little can be done with that amount in that context. For example,  psychologists are needed in the diagnostic process, but &pound;100,000 would bring  very few psychologists in to the system.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Basil McCrea mentioned the &pound;2&middot;2 million that underpins the  three-year plan, but that is, in fact, part of the additional resource of &pound;17  million for learning disability services. If my understanding is correct,  people who have an IQ of over 70 do not have access to learning disability  funding. Part of the Bill is aimed at modifying DDA so that people with an IQ of  over 70 will not be discriminated against in the future. I thank the Member for  giving way.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>: I  thank the Member for his intervention. Moneys for autism have been reduced from  &pound;2&middot;2 million to &pound;1&middot;54 million. Perhaps we need some clarification as to why  there has been a reduction in the moneys. I agree wholeheartedly with &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  No, because I am coming to the end of my speech.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  He has to defend the Minister.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  Go ahead.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  He is the John O&rsquo;Dowd of the Ulster Unionist Party.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Compliments indeed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members said that this is not about money, but their issue  is that we had to make cuts. I think that the figure is &pound;1&middot;6 million, although  the Minister will talk about that. It comes back to the argument that if there  are to be additional resources, they need to identified, costed and properly  scrutinised. We have to make decisions about where we want to take that money  from, and I have no doubt that we will have the Member&rsquo;s support in finding  additional funding for this very important issue.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>: I  thank the Member for his intervention. As usual, he is talking a load of  nonsense. However, as I come to the end of my speech, I return to the issue  that I raised earlier with Mr Bradley. The fact is that the Bill makes no  provision for an advocate. He addressed that to some extent. Hopefully, as the  Bill progresses and is finalised, and as we put in place all its strategies, we  may be able to look at including provision for an advocate at some stage in the  future. I support the Bill&rsquo;s Second Stage.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I thank the Minister for being present for the debate. I congratulate Mr  Bradley, members of the all-party Assembly group and the staff for their work  in formulating the clauses and drafting the Bill. I also thank the advocates  and the many parents and families of children with autistic spectrum disorder.  Constituents of mine are worried about the future prospects of their quite  young children, and during the earlier debate on the Commissioner for Older  People Bill, we were reminded by my party colleague Mrs Bradley that carers  save the Northern Ireland Budget more than &pound;3 billion a year.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, many carers, particularly carers of young  children with autism, do not receive much help. That is often because the  diagnosis is not clear, and they fall between two stools. For example, one lady  with six autistic children does not get any respite care because her children  have not been diagnosed with a severe learning disability. She does not have  any direct payments in order to plan their care and, for the past five years,  she has had inadequate housing to meet her family&rsquo;s needs. The list goes on and  on. That is only one example.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that that lady, like many others, is frustrated  by the general lack of awareness. Many young children whom I have met look like  quite normal children, as, indeed, they are, except that they have difficulties  in interacting and have behavioural problems. Many people blame the parents for  bad behaviour and for not bringing up their children properly, when, in fact,  those children have a recognised disorder. Therefore, they require special  treatment and consideration by health and other services.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members who contributed to the debate have made it evident  that there needs to be cross-departmental working. Although the Health Minister  is here, the issue cuts across the education and employment and learning  portfolios. Lessons are to be learnt across all public sector agencies in contact  with people with autism. In the same way as staff are trained to work with  people with visual or hearing impairments, the Bill asks for special training  and consideration to be given to agencies that provide services to people with  autism.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members have referred, rightly, to the funding and the  budget for implementing the Bill. However, I venture to suggest that a lot of  it is not rocket science. A lot of it is common sense. It is about joined-up  government and joined-up service delivery, and it often does not require a huge  budget. It is about doing things differently.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Does the Member agree that it can make economic sense to have that integrated  services and early intervention approach to issues such as autism, because it  saves money later?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving me the opportunity to speak as Chairperson of the  Committee for Employment and Learning and to mention the young people not in  education, employment or training (NEETS) inquiry report that we will launch in  January 2011, all being well. One main recommendation is that early prevention  and detection pay dividends in the longer term, not just to the individual but  to society as a whole. The Member is quite right that that makes economic  sense.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Since we are being so friendly, will the Member welcome the attendance of the  Minister of Education at this important debate, as we are going to talk about  integrated solutions?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I am sure that the Ministers decided between themselves who would be present  today. I acknowledge that. I said in my opening remarks that I welcomed the  presence of the Health Minister because the subject crosses many Executive  portfolios, most notably health and education.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Ms McCann pointed out that the financial costs attached to the legislation can  be matched to savings generated by reducing duplication between Departments as  a result of an effective strategy. Any financial costs attached to legislation  must be measured against the current human costs, the cost of loss of earnings  to families and the cost to the state. That is detailed very clearly in work  that has been carried out in the UK, Canada and Australia, and here in the  North in a publication by Autism Northern Ireland called &lsquo;Autism: The Costs&rsquo;.  Does the Member agree that any financial costs can be met through a phased  programme of implementation within funding already available for DDA  compliance?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  There are some measures that can be taken quite swiftly that could make a real  difference to people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am a parent, and I know that although you love your  children dearly, they can be very trying. That has to be the case much more so  for parents of children with a disability. Those parents are to be commended  for their work on behalf of wider society. They should be supported in that  role. The Member is right to say that there is a loss of earnings by parents  who provide that care.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The other point that the Member made was not just about  care but phased implementation. That could be done in conjunction and  consultation with the autism support groups. I do not think that people are  making unreasonable demands. It should be seen in the context of working  together to do things better and to provide better outcomes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill includes a requirement on each health and social  care trust to:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;provide data on the prevalence of autism in its area  in order &mdash;</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">(a) that it can publish and update the strategy; and</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">(b) that the Northern Ireland departments can  effectively implement the strategy.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is a critical starting point. It is something  that we have learned in our inquiry into young people not in education,  employment or training. We have to know the scale of the problem in order to  know how we can deal with it. I welcome that as a starting point for the  strategy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A lot has been said, but I will make one final point. I  have family members who have young people with disabilities. One of the  greatest fears of an uncle of mine was for the future of his child after he was  gone. After his own death, what would his child do and what would that child&rsquo;s  future be? Surely we should give some reassurance that society cares, not just  about how young people are given opportunities and allowed to develop into  adulthood but about their care into older age. That is something that this  Assembly should do. We heard earlier today about how, by bringing forward the  older people&rsquo;s legislation, the Assembly is putting democracy in action for  older people. Let us have democracy in action for some of the most vulnerable  in society: the children and young people who suffer from autism and associated  illnesses.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Girvan</strong>: I  support the Bill. However, in doing so, I want to make a few points that deal  with a number of elements in it. Autism affects not only those who are being  dealt with through the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  but other areas of government, such as education and social security. I have  dealt with a number of agencies on behalf of people who have been diagnosed as  being on the autistic spectrum and found that they treat people in the most  appalling manner. The Bill would help to provide proper training for those on  the front line who deal with people. It has been extremely difficult to get  some agencies to adopt a positive approach, so this legislation would be  extremely helpful in achieving that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Much noise has been made about the cost of implementing the  Bill. However, as far as I am concerned, we are trying to address an  inequality. Equality is peddled regularly in the Chamber. For those suffering  from the condition and the families who must deal with them, there is an  inequality. We have to take on board all aspects of people&rsquo;s daily living, not  just what they have to deal with from a health perspective. To deal with the  situation properly, we need to encourage people to come forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mention was made of how we can promote training through the  Bill. There needs to be buy-in, so I am sad to see that few members of other  Committees and Ministers from other Departments are here, because they will be  responsible for delivering funding through their Departments to ensure that  training happens. It was said that minimal cost would be involved. I do not  know whether that is true. However, we need to support the legislation, and I  am glad that it is before the House today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Every Member who contributed to the debate mentioned facts  and details relating to those who suffer from the condition. As far as I am  concerned, autism and ASD support groups have done a fantastic job in helping  to bring about this legislation, and I congratulate them for lobbying the  all-party Assembly group on autism (APAGA) and the Member who introduced the  Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Another point that needs to be made is whether the &pound;100,000  from the health budget is, in fact, additional funding. In interventions, some  Members indicated that the amount of money coming forward in recent years has  increased. I do not know whether that is accurate, but, in the light of what  has been said, it does not appear to be. I am not necessarily saying that we  need to spend a lot of money to make things happen, but it needs to be  recognised that the condition exists and that it requires special attention.  Special conditions need to be put in place to ensure that those suffering from  the condition are not put in jeopardy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am in favour of the motion, because the House owes it to  people who suffer from autism and ASD to have the Bill pass its Second Stage.  Such people form a large section of the community, and they do not always  receive an early diagnosis, which is a problem that, in the past, was probably  endemic in our society. People who are now adults may have suffered all their  life without being diagnosed. Another challenge is for the Department of  Education to get social workers to identify young people in school who have not  been diagnosed. That was another major problem in the past. Early intervention  procedures and resources must be put in place to deal with those who have been  diagnosed.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  As a member of the Assembly all-party group on autism, I welcome the fact that  the Autism Bill has reached Second Stage. I congratulate the chairman of the  group and all those who put so much work into it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As other Members pointed out, there have been a number of  important and positive milestones on the journey towards meeting the needs of  people with autism. Second Stage is another important milestone on the way to  eliminating the discrimination against those people with ASD who fall outside  the vision of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. The all-party group  autism proposes that the Government create a legal obligation for action on ASD  by enshrining it in legislation. That is the approach taken by the Autism Bill,  and the all-party group believes that that is the way forward. The Bill has  widespread support among the general public and from seven of the eight  voluntary agencies that are involved in autism.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As previously indicated, a number of research projects on  autism have been carried out in Northern    Ireland. Those include the Northern Ireland  Assembly Research and Library Service&rsquo;s 2008 reports, &lsquo;Improving Services for  People with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)&rsquo;, &lsquo;Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD)&rsquo;  and its 2010 report on the Autism Bill. Those were independent research  reports, all of which support the principles of the Bill. In addition, the  Assembly all-party group on autism carried out a consultation in March 2010,  which resulted in an 80% approval rating for ASD legislation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Equality Commission and Disability Action confirmed  that the new Bill would bring clarity. Many Members will recall the walk for  legislation rally in which we participated in 2008. All the political parties  were presented with a petition that was signed by thousands of supporters of  the Bill. Again, all but one of the ASD-specific voluntary organisations  supported the general principles of the Bill. All 26 councils have given some  positive support for the Bill, and the political parties in the Assembly with,  perhaps, one exception, have all agreed to vote for it. Some parties have  included in their manifesto their belief that action on ASD should be treated  as a priority. There is considerable support among political parties and the  general public for the Autism Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As part of the legislative process, the Assembly all-party  group on autism issued a consultation document on the Bill to get the views of  the various bodies that were involved in autism. The document was sent to 38  consultees across all sectors, and 26 completed responses were received, which  was a response rate of approximately 70%. The main findings of the consultation  were extremely positive. The need for a cross-departmental strategy was widely  supported by 80% of the respondents. They agreed that the new law should  require the autism strategy to be cross-departmental; in other words, that all  the relevant Departments should be required to work together to agree on and  implement the strategy, but not in the piecemeal way in which work is carried  out at present, which causes people to fall through the net. Given the diverse  needs of the autistic population, cross-departmental accountability is central  to the successful implementation of the strategy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some 72% of respondents to the consultation supported the  need for autism legislation. One respondent noted that the Bill should promote  fairness and provide access to and support for services based on the needs of  the individual, not on whether such individuals comply with the requirements of  the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. Another respondent claimed that the  Bill would challenge the exclusion from services that faces many people with  autism and their families and carers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The consultation also highlighted the need for formal  partnerships. Again, 72% of respondents agreed that the law underpinning a  cross-departmental strategy should promote a partnership among Departments,  public bodies and community and voluntary sector bodies, and they emphasised  that such bodies had a lot of expertise that must be used. The consultation  also highlighted the need for an agreed definition of ASD across all  Departments and in guidance. That proposal received the support of 88% of  respondents.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are concerns, but they have largely been met by the  Bill. The Bill can improve the lives of thousands of people with autism and  their families, and, therefore, I support it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education (Mr Storey)</strong>: I speak as the Chairperson of  the Education Committee, as it is important that the House be made aware of the  Education Committee&rsquo;s scrutiny of the Bill. The Committee received its most  recent briefing on the Autism Bill from Mr Dominic Bradley at its meeting on 3  November 2010. The Committee raised a number of issues, including the statement  in the Bill&rsquo;s explanatory and financial memorandum that:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The bill will not have significant financial  implications.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That is particularly interesting in light of the requirement  in clause 3(5) that all public servants:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;who deal directly with the public in the course of  their duties are given autism awareness training.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will come back to the issue of training later.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee also raised possible unforeseen consequences  of the Bill. For example, we considered whether the Disability Discrimination  Act 1995 might mean that extreme shyness could be claimed as a substantial  long-term social impairment under the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: Yes. The Member&rsquo;s intervention will, no  doubt, be as short as all the previous ones.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  I have no doubt about that myself. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.] </span>The  Member mentioned the example of extreme shyness. Under the Bill, it will be  necessary for a person to have a diagnosis, and, as I am sure the Member is  aware from his constituency work, a diagnosis is not simply handed out. A  strict number of hurdles must be crossed before a diagnosis is complete. There  is no laissez-faire attitude whereby something such as extreme shyness will  qualify a person.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: I thank the Member for his brevity. We  raised those issues with the Department, and we still await a response.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee raised the issue of the Department of  Education&rsquo;s view, which was expressed in a letter to the Committee dated 25  August, that both the health and education sectors are implementing a strategic  autism action plan and that a high priority is being given to partnership  working between the Department of Education and the Department of Health,  Social Services and Public Safety. It stated that there is also an active  inter-education and library board ASD group that recently received an extremely  positive Education and Training Inspectorate (ETI) evaluation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The final issue that the Committee raised with Mr Bradley  on 3 November was about a point that was highlighted in the Department of  Education&rsquo;s briefing paper on autism from July 2009. That document pointed out  that children with ASD often have other associated serious conditions and that  if the autism legislation covers children with dual or multiple diagnoses, that  raises the issue of discrimination against children who do not suffer from ASD.  The Committee raised those issues during Mr Bradley&rsquo;s presentation, and it is  only right and proper that the House be made aware of them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for Education raised a few key issues on the  Bill on 3 November. The Committee wrote immediately to the Department of  Education on 4 November to ask for its views on the Bill as soon as possible,  bearing in mind that the Bill was scheduled for introduction to the House.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I must inform the House that the Committee has not yet  received the Department of Education&rsquo;s specific view on the Bill. The  Committee&rsquo;s statutory duty is to scrutinise the implications of the Bill for  the education service. From the Committee&rsquo;s scrutiny to date, it is clear that  there are complex issues, such as the implications of the proposed changes to  special educational needs policy and its associated legislation, some of which  may have important implications for education. That is where the Committee for  Education is with the Bill. Until we receive and scrutinise a detailed,  specific response from the Department, I cannot comment any further. The  Committee will come back to the issue at a later stage.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I now speak as a Member. I welcome the opportunity to make  a few comments on the Bill. No one in the House underestimates or in any way  places limits on the seriousness of the issue. That is often the case when  Members come to the House to deal with serious and complex issues, such as  autism. None of us are experts in the field, despite all our efforts to give  that impression to the outside world. The experts are those who have to deal  with the situation on a day-to-day basis; the families, the parents, the  practitioners and the professionals. They see the huge problems and challenges that  are presented by the complex needs of children, young people and, indeed, older  people with autism. A Member raised the point that we should not forget that,  earlier today, the House endorsed the establishment of a Commissioner for Older  People. We should not forget, therefore, that older people also suffer from the  condition.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Recently, I received some correspondence, as we all do. All  Members are inundated with correspondence, and I pay tribute to those members  of our society in Northern    Ireland who take the time and make the  effort to write. They feel that the issue is important enough to contact their  local representative. For many years, apart from local councillors, there has  been a democratic deficit at a regional level in Northern Ireland. Decisions were  made by direct rule Ministers who did not have to face constituents when they  went out to do their normal weekly chores in the supermarket or in the main  street of their town.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Now, as a result of the House being in existence, and  despite all its flaws and imperfections, we have opportunities. If those behind  the legislation were asked whether, without the House, the Bill would have come  to fruition, they would say that that would not have been the case.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Does the Member agree that the Bill is not only a case of democracy in action,  but is also the right thing to do?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: The Member is absolutely right. It is right  that we ensure that we make every provision, legislatively and practically, for  those in society. The Member&rsquo;s point is well made, and it is a point that is  given.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One particular issue is of grave concern to me. As a  precursor to my comments, they are neither an attack on the Education Minister  nor an attack on a Minister from another Department. I could easily come to the  House and, because my party does not have the health portfolio, say that all  the problems with the Bill&rsquo;s delivery emanate from the Minister of Health,  Social Services and Public Safety. However, Members must realise the  seriousness of the issue. Irrespective of their class, colour, creed, where  they hang their hat on a Sunday or with which political party they have an  affiliation, many families in Northern    Ireland are affected by autism on a  day-to-day basis. It is easy to say that we should not play party politics with  the issue. Unfortunately, however, that often happens with serious issues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That was a precursor to what I want to say about education.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have a letter from a parent who raises very serious  concerns about the state of current provision:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The pathway of entry to diagnosis for many children  is not through the agreed healthcare pathway we have worked on, but through  education. This diagnostic pathway through school we have very little  information on. This is a pathway which does not follow an agreed time frame,  does not tell us about the agreed diagnostic methods and is, in essence, not  open to us to discuss. It depends upon identification by schools and involves several  standards of assessment, including paediatricians. This is one of the  multidisciplinary assessments which involves educational psychologist  profiles.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">How many Members have been contacted by  constituents who are, rightly, complaining and raising concerns about the  psychologist assessments and the way in which the needs of children are  identified? Repeatedly, only a limited number of allocations are given to  schools, which is inadequate to deal with all the issues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That parent went on to say:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;In my personal case, I met with the teacher and  delivered information on&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">&mdash; she then names her son &mdash;</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;at the start of each year, in his seven years of  education.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Now, listen to this:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;One teacher had gone on inset training and her  feedback on it was that it was simply not enough help.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Members, we come to this House and stand here and  say that we support this Bill. However, are we absolutely sure that in  supporting this Bill, we will be able to change the structures that are clearly  not delivering for children with autism and their parents?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I conclude by turning to an issue that this House needs to  seriously address. It has been raised by Members, and it is the autism  provision vis-&agrave;-vis the Middletown  centre. We would do well to remind ourselves what the Comptroller and Auditor  General for Northern Ireland  found in his 2009 report. This is dealing with young people, allegedly, who  have autism. This was a body that was set up to deal with the specific problems  facing children with autism. The Comptroller and Auditor General said:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Key services including working directly with young  people with autistic spectrum disorders are not being achieved despite the  Centre operating since 2007 and it appears unlikely that the position will  change in the short term.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Despite &pound;13 million of investment, no direct work  with any child has been carried out over this period. At least eight changes  have been made in strategic direction.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We talk about a joined-up approach. Earlier, Ian McCrea  talked about the missing piece of the puzzle. I think that the puzzle has been  thrown up in the air, and we do not know where some of the pieces are. I am  convinced that it is not about additional money. If there is an education  issue, it is easy for me to say to the Education Minister that she should do x,  y and z. And, of course, the Education Minister looks across and says, &ldquo;Well, I  would do that if you would support me and give me more money.&rdquo; I am sure that  every Minister could spend more money. Every Minister could find an allocation  where he would be able to put a certain amount of additional money. However, I  do not think that it is just about more money. Are we clear in our minds that  this Bill will ensure that the money that is currently available is being spent  in the most appropriate way to benefit our children?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In my view, what we have in Middletown is a white elephant. I urge the  Minister of Health &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  The Member talked about &pound;13 million being spent, and he referred to the  Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s comments on how that money is being spent.  Does he think that it is a waste of money to train and upskill people to  deliver a service for children with autism?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: That question would be better asked to the  parents I have met over the past number of months. No less recently than  yesterday, I met a group of parents who represent at least 1,000 parents, and  they said that spending has brought no benefit to them as parents of children  with autism. I am not interested in boosting some limited company and spending  a huge amount of money on buildings that are not built. Salaries are being  drawn at a huge cost to the taxpayer, and we are not getting an output.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Is the Member as bemused as me about why the Minister of Education seems to be  so set on Middletown?  No real argument has been put forward for why we should put that form of  expenditure in there. There is general support for dealing with issues and  trying to get money to the people who need it, but the argument is not being made.  Does he understand why we are continuing to invest in Middletown?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Although Middletown  may be an issue for another debate, today&rsquo;s debate is on the Autism Bill.  Perhaps we can turn back to that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: Middletown  is relevant, because the issue is about the amount of money that is mentioned  in the explanatory and financial memorandum. That is why I raised the issue at  the outset. It was raised in the Committee for Education, because we have to ensure  that there will be no resource implications from the issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In answer to the Member&rsquo;s intervention, it is not for me to  get into the mind of the Minister of Education and explain why she supports  certain things. Perhaps I am contradicting my earlier comment that politicians  should not play politics with this issue, but I think that Middletown is being supported because of  agreements that were made in the past. &ldquo;North/Southery&rdquo; arrangements came out  of the Belfast Agreement. The Middletown Centre for Autism was the result of a  North/South arrangement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My point is this: is the money that we are spending being  spent appropriately? I am disappointed that Chairpersons of other Committees,  on whom the Bill impinges, are not here to speak about what they have done. I  know that it is not practical for all of the Ministers to be present when an  issue is cross-departmental and requires cross-working, but I ask the Health  Minister to take the points that I have made. I have also made the points on  the Committee for Education, and we are awaiting a response from the Department  on the specifics of the Bill. I ask him to take on board the concerns about the  amount of money, Middletown,  and the current strategic delivery of the services. Is that being done in the  best way that advances the children and parents who have to deal daily with a  serious issue, which is, unfortunately, all too common in our society?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>:  I support the Bill, and I appreciate the presence of the Minister of Health,  Social Services and Public Safety. I appreciate the contributions from the  Chairperson of the Committee for Education and from the Chairperson of the  Committee for Employment and Learning, because, as many Members have said, this  is not a provision for a single Department. One of the Bill&rsquo;s main purposes is  to try to break a silo mentality that has apparently afflicted autism service  provision over many years across this region.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">From my attendance at the Health Committee meeting last  week and my reading of the submission from the Department, it seems to me that  the Health Department and possibility other Departments have an &ldquo;it will be all  right on the night&rdquo; type of attitude. As Mary Byrne and Ann Widdecombe found  out on Sunday night, it is not always all right on the night. Unfortunately,  for many families of someone with autism and for children and adults with the  condition throughout Northern    Ireland, it has not been all right on the  night for many nights and days over many years. That is why I commend my  colleague Dominic Bradley and other members of the all-party group on autism  for putting so much work into the Bill, and I further commend Dominic for  bringing it before the House.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, the experience of many people with autism  and other conditions across the ASD spectrum and their families has been one of  disjointed services. Outcomes have been dependent on where they lived or on  what staff were available at a particular time or place, and the strategies  have been discretionary. The Bill&rsquo;s purpose is to replace the begging bowl and  busking hat that families have had to take from one statutory agency to another  with a statutory guarantee. It is useful that the Assembly reflects on the  point that other Members made about the intervention at Westminster in 2009. Although not all the  statutory provisions are identical, Westminster  also took the position that it would not always be all right on the night. The  House should bear that consideration in mind, as well as the steps that are  being taken in Scotland.  The position must be reached at which people with autism and their families are  seen not as society&rsquo;s burden but as its asset. That potential must be  emancipated in the region&rsquo;s legislation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, I view the Bill as a silo-busting provision.  Since I took my place in the House and, in particular, since I was appointed to  the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety, I have been  contacted by constituents in the Western Trust area in anticipation of the  Bill. The message from many of them is that the services are fractured, and  they want something to be done about that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members on the opposite Benches referred to cost on  numerous occasions, as have other Members of the House. The message from  families and, indeed, from front line workers who are involved in service  provision is that, in fact, services are often duplicated and poorly  co-ordinated. Front line workers, who are highly specialised and trained people,  are frustrated that they find it difficult to co-ordinate the agencies that  work with people with autism. In many ways, therefore, the Bill should release  funds through better co-ordination, co-operation and reduction of service  duplication.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the western area, the education and library board side  of the house has a dedicated autism team and a communications team that also  deals with children with autism. The Western Trust side of the house has a  learning disability team, which, I understand, takes the lead in many cases. In  addition, there is input from speech and language therapists and so on. I have  been told by families and workers that some of those services do not  communicate well with one another. In some cases, the uptake of one service can  preclude a child or adult from access to another service. That should concern  the House, and it is a reason to support the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I received an e-mail from a front line worker in autism  services. She works in the statutory sector, and she said:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;There are so many teams out there that no one knows  what the other is doing. It is very frustrating, especially for us on the  ground, but more frustrating for the families, given the volumes of  appointments that they have to attend. Services for anyone on the spectrum are disjointed.  The greatest loser is the child.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The Bill will go a long way in helping to deliver  more co-ordinated and better planned provision throughout the region, which  will, I hope, do away with some of her concerns.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, more joined-up thinking is needed. It seems to  me that the silo mentality here radiates from the very top. At last week&rsquo;s  Committee meeting, we received a briefing from departmental officials. I want  my remarks to be taken not as a criticism of the Department but as an accurate  reflection of the state of play. During that briefing, the Committee was told  that the Department&rsquo;s production of a detailed autism strategy was well  advanced. However, when the matter was pressed in Committee, it was fairly  apparent that officials from the Department of Education had not co-ordinated  with the officials from the Department of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety when they prepared their autism strategy. Either Department could say  that that is fair enough and that no rules were broken. However, the Bill will  provide for one statutorily based strategy for the Northern Ireland region, and it  will impress a statutory duty on all Departments to co-ordinate in the  development of that strategy. That will allow for the better planning of  services, with various Departments having an input from the get-go, and the  different pieces of the jigsaw, to borrow an analogy from a Member from a  different side of the House, would be put together earlier in the process. That  would, ipso facto, lead to better outcomes on the ground.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In order to achieve better planning and outcomes, it is  important that the Assembly consider its overarching responsibility to bring  together the agencies and their efforts. That is why I again say that autism is  not solely a health issue and that it should not be treated as such. I hope  that the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety will receive  briefings and input from officials from other Departments, rather than just  those from the Department whose Minister is in the Chamber this evening.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The history of autism services in this region has far too  often been one of promises not delivered. It is incumbent on every Member to  vote for the Bill if they want to guarantee services, rather than potentially  risk replicating the delays, distress and disappointments that too many  families have experienced. If devolution is to make a difference to people, we  need to break that cycle and bring about better delivery. There has been a  history of should-have-beens, and it seems that one Department is presenting us  with a promise of maybes, but we need to deliver a future of will-bes for the  families out there. That is why I, for one, will vote for the Bill today.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: I have heard and  taken on board the comments of the Members who have spoken on the Bill today. I  want to reiterate my commitment to improving health and social care services  for children and adults with autism and those who devote a large part of their  life to caring for them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My record on the matter speaks for itself. My Department  published an ASD strategic action plan in 2009. That plan set out in detail the  improvements that the Department wanted to make and the timescale over which  they would be completed. To ensure that those improvements are implemented  equally across Northern    Ireland, I established the regional autistic  spectrum disorder network group, which is chaired by Dr Stephen Bergin. That  network group is multidisciplinary and multiagency in nature, and it receives  input from colleagues in education services. That goes a long way towards  meeting the stated aims of the supporters of the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Through the network group, we have delivered significant  improvements in the service. Despite increased referrals &mdash; up almost 40% over  the past year &mdash; we have made a big reduction in the number of children waiting  more than 13 weeks for an assessment. The majority of trusts are already  meeting that target, and it is expected that, by March 2011, no child in Northern Ireland  will wait more than 13 weeks for an assessment. In addition, I was pleased to  announce the development of a diagnostic pathway for children and young people  last week. That pathway will be implemented from this month across all trusts  and will ensure that, no matter where a child lives in Northern Ireland,  they will experience the same assessment process and be subject to the same  timescales. The implementation of the pathway will also facilitate more  appropriate data collection at trust level and help us to more clearly  understand the prevalence of autism here.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As part of the network, I have also established a reference  group under the chairmanship of Lord Maginnis. That reference group facilitates  the involvement of 30 parents, service users and carers and 10 voluntary  organisations in the design and planning of autism services. Those best placed  to know where improvements are necessary are now in a position to influence  that change. Many parents, carers and those who use social care services  expressed strong support for that approach.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As well as establishing that robust infrastructure to  deliver improvements, I invested significant money in supporting the action  plan. From March 2011, an additional &pound;1&middot;6 million recurrent will be available  for autism services. That will support the network to complete the excellent  work that it began and to identify and begin work on other priority areas,  particularly on adult services.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I was able to do all that within the authority and  legislation that is currently available to me. I will continue my commitment to  targeting all available resources at front line services to improve the lives  of those living with autism and for those caring for and supporting them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I can advise that the Bill was discussed by Executive  colleagues at our meeting on 2 December 2010. Following preliminary legal  opinion, reservations were expressed regarding the proposed amendment to the  Disability Discrimination Act 1995 and in relation to the Bill&rsquo;s compliance  with the European Convention on Human Rights. I have sought the view of the  Attorney General on the Bill&rsquo;s competence and will return to Members once that  view has been received. The Assembly will also wish to reassure itself on the  Bill&rsquo;s competence.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Apart from that, my Department will play a full role, as  would only be expected, with the Committee as it deliberates on the proposals  for the Bill. I look forward to the discussions that will ensue.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  I thank all those who participated in the debate. It was a long debate, and I  think that all Members who wished to do so had the opportunity to express their  views.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I shall start at the end and deal first with the Minister&rsquo;s  points. He referred to the attitude and reservations of his colleagues in the  Executive about the Bill. Obviously, I am not privy to the confidential  discussions that take place in the Executive Committee. The Minister is privy  to those discussions, and sometimes it looks as if Mr McCrea is as well,  because he happens to have the same reservations about the Bill&rsquo;s compliance  with the European Convention on Human Rights. Could I point out to both the  Minister &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  I cannot refuse after the Member gave way to me three times.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Since the Member raised the issue, I make the point that I sit on the Policing  Board, I chair the human rights and professional standards committee of the  Policing Board and I spoke at my party conference on Saturday on the issue of  human rights. Human rights and the European Convention on Human Rights are very  important to me, and I raised my concerns on that basis. However, it is just a  question. Let us find out what the answer is.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  I will accept that on this occasion it is mere coincidence that the Member and  his Minister have reservations about the same issue. However, I must point out  to both of them that the Bill was examined by the Assembly&rsquo;s legal team. It was  found to be competent, and that was accepted by the Speaker. However, if there  are other legal issues, we are certainly prepared to look at them. I am glad  that the Minister is now resorting to the Attorney General for legal advice.  Previously, he quoted the Chief Medical Officer on the issue of legal advice.  It is progress that the Minister is now taking advice from the Attorney  General.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: On a point of order, Mr Deputy  Speaker. It is a procedure within the Executive, since the appointment of the  Attorney General, that his advice is available. It is not that it is progress  for me; it is progress for the Executive that the Attorney General is available  to us. The Member should perhaps weigh his remarks in a different direction.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  I am suitably admonished by the Minister, and I accept what he says. Of course,  I do not think we had an Attorney General when we were originally dealing with  this issue, so that is a major development, without a doubt.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In any case, the Minister has outlined the good work that  he has done in the field of autism, and we heard earlier about the investment  in resources that has gone into much of that work. I welcome that, and I hope  that that work is done effectively and efficiently. However, what I hear from  some of the autism community in Northern    Ireland is that the Department&rsquo;s action plan  for autism has in fact disenfranchised a significant section of that community,  who feel that the Department&rsquo;s attitude towards legislation is dismissive.  Quite a bit of tension has grown up between parts of the autism community and  the Department on that issue. We saw that manifested in a recent television  programme.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department has certainly been opposed to the Bill. The  Department is so opposed to the Bill that it was opposed to it before it was  even drafted. That is an attitude that requires some examination and  re-examination. Officials from the Department were able to tell me some years  ago in Washington  that it would not agree to legislation. Before the Bill was even seen by the  Department, it was opposed by the Department. I suspect that there is an  attitude within the Civil Service that, as my colleague P&oacute;l Callaghan said, is  based in a silo mentality that does not want to change or to co-operate with  other Departments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As we have heard today, autism is a lifelong condition, and  it requires a lifelong response. The best way in which we can provide that is  through a cross-cutting, cross-departmental strategy. I hope that the difficulties  that we are seeing from the Health Department can be overcome, because it is  such an important issue. That has been emphasised by Mr McCrea, Mr Storey and  numerous other Members during the debate. It is such a serious issue that, as  Mr McCrea said, we need to get it right. As sponsor of the Bill and as  chairperson of the all-party group, I am prepared to get it right.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I pointed out in my initial remarks, we have listened to  criticism from various quarters and have reacted and adopted the Bill in  response to that criticism. If there is further constructive criticism, we will  take that on board. We look forward to Committee Stage and to strengthening any  weaknesses in the Bill at that stage.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  This is my second intervention; we have one more to go. The Member has rightly  put forward arguments and said that he has listened to things. We have also  listened to what he has had to say. The Ulster Unionist Party is on record as  saying that we welcome the movement of the Bill through to Consideration Stage  and we are prepared to engage properly. That is the tone in which we look at  it. We are all trying to do our best, but we just want to make sure that we get  it right.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  I have absolutely no contention with what the Member says. In fact, I welcome  his attitude and know that he will engage constructively in the process.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a strong case for legislation, and we have made  that case. Many Members agreed that there needs to be a change to the  Disability Discrimination Act 1995 and that there needs to be a strategy. I do  not want to go through what each Member said in detail, but it would be remiss  of me to ignore the various contributions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The first Member to speak was Mr Wells, the Chairman of the  Health Committee. He informed us that the Committee is not totally of one mind  about legislation. As Chairperson, he wishes to remain objective, and he will  examine the evidence in due course. I accept his position on the issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Michelle O&rsquo;Neill outlined some autism statistics: there had  been a 500% increase in prevalence over the past seven years, and there are  four times more males with autism than females. She mentioned the fact that  proper intervention can help individuals and enable them to lead a productive  life. She was interested in the equality aspects of the Bill and argued that  the Bill does not create a hierarchy of disabilities; it does the opposite by  giving rights to those who are denied them. Mr McCarthy, who spoke on behalf of  the Alliance Party, was very supportive as well.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Gardiner cautioned that there is not always a need to  legislate. That was echoed by Mr Basil McCrea. I agree with that point, and I  dealt with it in one of the interventions. I am sure that the House does not  want me to expand on it again.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Jonathan Craig spoke in favour of the Bill. He mentioned  how ASD conditions can fall between various stools and explained that the IQ  anomaly discriminates against people with autism who have an IQ above 70. He  highlighted once again the need for a cross-cutting approach.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I need not go into the detail of Mr Basil McCrea&rsquo;s contribution.  He and I expanded on that sufficiently during the debate, and I hope that I  dealt with the arguments that he raised about human rights. However, he has the  right to explore those issues as the Bill goes into Committee.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Pat Ramsey also spoke in support of the Bill. He gave the  heart-rending example of the mother of an adult son with autism. She was, he  said, worn out, and her major concern was what will happen to her son when she  can no longer care for him. At this stage, the supposition is that he will  probably be institutionalised. That is something that we have to change. No  matter what party or side of the House we come from, we have to ensure that we  put in place processes and support that make it unnecessary for a person in  that position to be institutionalised. We should be working against such an  approach.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Ian McCrea described the Bill as the missing piece of the  puzzle, and Mr Storey expanded on that metaphor. Mr McCrea underlined the need  for buy-in from all Departments. Mr Easton mentioned his major reservation: the  absence of the autism advocate. However, I dealt with that issue following an  intervention by him.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mrs Kelly agreed with a phased implementation programme,  with funding already available for DDA compliance. She appealed to the House to  let us have democracy in action. Paul Girvan said that we are trying to address  an inequality and that we owe it to the autistic community to do so. Brian  Wilson described the Bill as an important milestone on the way to eradicating  discrimination against people with autism. He outlined the wide support for the  Bill and the very positive outcome of the consultation carried out by the  all-party group.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Storey raised some issues that were brought to the  Education Committee. However, I dealt with those issues in an intervention, so  I will not repeat them now. He said that the real experts in autism are those  who deal with the issue on a day-to-day basis. Mr Storey also agreed that  introducing the Bill was the right thing to do and was, as Mrs Kelly said,  democracy in action. He also mentioned the need for the Bill to change the  current structures, which are evidently not delivering. Furthermore, he  underlined the fact that this is not about additional money but about ensuring  that we use the resources that we have to hand to the best effect.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr P&oacute;l Callaghan welcomed the Minister to the House, and I  do, too. I am glad that he is here and that he responded to the debate. Mr  Callaghan also welcomed the Chairperson of the Education Committee and the  Chairperson of the Committee for Employment and Learning. Mr Callaghan  mentioned the silo mentality and said that the Bill should be a silo-busting  mechanism to ensure that there is cross-departmental co-operation in addressing  the problem.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have already dealt with the Minister&rsquo;s contribution. I  tried to summarise, as best I could, what was quite a long debate with quite a  number of contributions. Mr Deputy Speaker, I am grateful to you and your staff  for enabling us to debate the Bill&rsquo;s Second Stage today. I think that every  Member concerned, even those who might have reservations about the Bill,  acknowledged that this is an important day for the autism community. I look  forward to Committee Stage and to being back here for Consideration Stage. Go  raibh c&eacute;ad maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That the Second Stage of the Autism Bill [NIA 2/10] be  agreed.</p>
    <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="h"></a>Executive Committee Business</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Local Government (Disqualification) Bill: Final Stage</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. The Speaker advised the House this morning that Ms Purvis  was unwell and unable to move the Final Stage of the Local Government  (Disqualification) Bill today. This item of business will be rescheduled in due  course.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Will you ask the Speaker to rule on  whether it is appropriate to use a petition of concern in relation to the Bill?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Under Standing Orders, a petition of concern may be submitted on  any matter that Members are concerned about. So, it is in order to put forward  a petition of concern on any issue.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  Could you check that with the Speaker, please? I do not think that it was  envisaged that it would be used in that way.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I will certainly check that. However, I am just telling you what  the situation is: it is very much within the Act, and that is how it has been  used in the House in the past.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Motion made:</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">That the Assembly do now adjourn. &mdash; [Mr Deputy Speaker.]</p>
    <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="i"></a>Adjournment</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Dromore   Primary School</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Before we begin, I advise Members that the Minister of Education  is not available to respond to the debate, because she is snowed in. However,  the Minister for Regional Development, Conor Murphy, will respond on her  behalf. I remind Members that the proposer of the topic will have 15 minutes in  which to speak. All other Members who wish to speak will have approximately six  minutes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Givan</strong>: I  appreciate Minister Murphy&rsquo;s standing in for the Education Minister. Indeed, Dromore Primary School was one of the schools  that had to cancel its lessons today because of the snow. It is, therefore, a  problem that many people are facing.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I tabled the Adjournment topic because of a desperate need  for the financial resources to be provided so that the new primary school can  go ahead. I am sure that Members from Lagan Valley  will agree. Dromore   Central Primary    School is located on the Banbridge Road, 200 metres from the town  centre. It was originally built to replace First  Dromore Presbyterian  Church School,  Church of Ireland School and the Unitarian   School, which was known  as Hunters&rsquo; School. It was extended in 1979 to cater for an increase in pupils  from the town and surrounding rural areas.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Today, 697 children are enrolled at Dromore Central   Primary School. That  figure has grown rapidly over the years, and it continues to grow as many  first-time homeowners and young families move into the area. Members who are  familiar with Dromore will know that the village and its rural areas have seen  a considerable increase in the numbers of young people moving to the area. Many  young people moved from around Lisburn because they were often priced out of  that area. As a result, they moved to the outer villages around Lisburn city,  where they were able to find more affordable housing. That drove an increase in  the number of people moving to the area. The numbers at the school are a good  problem that it has had to try to manage. Nevertheless, the vast number of  children who attend the school has created several difficulties.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that everyone will agree that, given the pupil  numbers, the current building is not fit for purpose. There are 14 temporary  classrooms at the school, and another mobile classroom will be provided in the  next academic year because of the increasing demands that will be put on the  school.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The school faces a number of problems owing to conditions  and a lack of capacity. For example, the assembly hall can accommodate only one  third of the children. The standards expected for toilet provision are below  what one would expect. Some 250 boys in the more senior years share seven  urinals and four toilets. There are no toilets for male members of staff. They  use a disabled toilet, but no toilets are specifically set aside for their use.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The fabric of the building is in a deplorable condition.  Indeed, when I spoke to the principal this morning, he said that the extension  that was built in 1979 is in a worse condition than the main building, which  was built in the 1930s. I do not know whether that has to do with the standard  of building that took place in 1979 or whether people were better at building  in the 1930s. However, the fabric of the building concerns the school greatly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The board of governors&rsquo; premises subcommittee recently  carried out an inspection and identified 28 deficiencies in the school  building. It informed the Southern Education and Library Board (SELB) of them.  Some of the deficiencies relate to health and safety concerns for the staff and  children in the school. I recently asked the Minister about the maintenance  backlog in Lagan Valley, and the figure came to almost  &pound;6&middot;5 million. Out of 42 schools in Lagan  Valley that require maintenance, Dromore Central Primary School  has the greatest maintenance backlog, with around &pound;640,000 required. That fact  crystallises the need that must be met.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The school rightly feels that the building is deteriorating  at a quicker rate because work is not being carried out to deal with the  existing problems. One could understand that situation were a new school going  to be built. It does not make economic sense to spend that amount of money if a  newbuild is going to be put in place, which is what we are all working towards.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Due to the lack of space in the school, three lunch breaks  are required to accommodate the amount of children there. Those staggered lunch  breaks have resulted in the costs for supervision and support staff rocketing,  because people are required to serve the food and to supervise. The school is  concerned about the costs, which exist due to the lack of space and the  increasing number of pupils at the school.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I spoke to the principal, and I was aware that the issue  had been going on for a number of years. He informed me that his first meeting  on the matter with the education board was 15 years ago, and, at that stage,  the board was considering options as to how to go about addressing the need  that existed then. This process has gone on for a considerable time.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Around seven years ago, the education board proposed to  purchase the Mossvale site. It was the only site that could accommodate the  type of school that it wanted to build. It was not deemed feasible to demolish  the existing school, relocate and build a new school on the existing site, and  the board came up with the Mossvale site as the best option. At that time, it  was estimated that the total cost to purchase the site and build the school  would be &pound;5&middot;5 million.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Issues arose at that time, a number of which related to  contamination around the land, and the board had to look into a number of  concerns. It took the board two and a half years to consider the issues that  had been raised since it was originally going to purchase and build. In that  intervening period, the price of the land increased to somewhere in the region  of &pound;7 million, and the decision was made that it was still the best option. The  land was purchased by the Department of Education, or rather the board, at that  renewed value. You can, therefore, understand the deep frustration that exists.  The school could have been built, and it could have been in operation for three  years now. Furthermore, it could have been delivered for less than the &pound;7  million that was used to purchase the land.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, we are where we are. Planning permission has been  granted. I am aware that there were some issues around planning, but they have  been resolved. Design work has been completed for a 28-classroom facility.  Everyone I have spoken to is delighted with the proposal, and they believe that  the scheme addresses the needs that exist in Dromore and can accommodate the  anticipated future growth. There were concerns that the previous scheme did not  meet the needs, but everyone is content with the current scheme and believes  that it is a good scheme to proceed with.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the Department&rsquo;s most recent announcement on schools  that are deemed fully or partially compliant, Dromore Central   Primary School was in the  fully compliant category. Therefore, it meets the Department&rsquo;s policies on the  school and the need for a new school. That is why it was such a bitter  disappointment for those concerned when, in the recent announcement of an award  of around &pound;13 million additional funding for capital schemes, Dromore was not  on the list. There was a lot of disappointment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I pay tribute to the principal and the board of governors.  It has taken a long time to get to this stage, and there have been a number of  setbacks and disappointments, the most recent of which occurred in the past  couple of months. However, they have continued to pursue the needs that exist,  and they are trying to put forward their concerns. I know that the board of  governors agreed last week to write to the Minister again to ask for a further  update. Despite the setbacks, the principal and the board of governors have  continued to pursue their case, which, I believe, is very strong.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister followed up on the issue in response to our  local MP. The Minister said that one reason why Dromore was not on the list was  that the tendering process was not at an advanced enough stage and she had to  go for the schools for which planning permission was in place and tendering  processes had been progressed. She said that Dromore&rsquo;s tendering process was  not at the stage required to allow her to give it the go-ahead. When I speak to  representatives from the school and the education board, they tell me that the  Department has made it clear to the board that they are not to proceed in  developing a tendering case for Dromore Central.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The school would like to have that issue clarified, because  it is caught in a catch-22. If a decision is taken to not fund the school  because the tendering process is not at an advanced enough stage, yet the  education board is telling the school that it has been instructed by the  Department to not progress the tendering process, the school is left in a very  precarious position as it wonders whether it will ever get the go-ahead for the  project. If that issue cannot be clarified today, I would appreciate it if it  could be in future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The principal has engaged positively with all the people  with whom he has been connected. The school continues to campaign for the  newbuild. In light of the number of concerns that have been raised, the  maintenance backlog and the lack of capacity, we ask that Dromore Central   Primary School be made a  priority case. I recognise that the financial environment has changed  drastically, but capital funding of some degree will still be available for new  schools. Dromore Central Primary School  has a very strong argument for being made a priority case when funding becomes  available.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The need is chronic. The teachers, despite the physical  environment, continue to provide a first-class education service to the  children, but a newbuild environment would enhance the educational experience.  I am on the board of governors of Pond  Park Primary   School and Ballymacash   Primary School. Pond Park   Primary School opened its  new school just a year ago, and the children benefit greatly from the  experience of a new environment, the most up-to-date technology and the play  facility. I think that that is what everyone in the Chamber, including the  Minister, wants for Dromore   Central Primary    School.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The case has been well made to me, and I hope that I have  been able to convey that to the Minister and the Department. I hope that, in  the not-too-distant future, we will get to the objective that I believe we all  want to get to.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  A number of questions arise. Even if Mr Murphy is not able to handle them, we  can at least put them on the record to see whether they can be dealt with. My  colleague outlined the case for Dromore   Central Primary    School in particular, but there are a number of  issues that pertain. He asked for that school project to be made a priority,  and I understand and fully support his reason for doing so. However, the  criteria that the Minister of Education uses to set out which schools should be  done in which order are not yet clear. Perhaps that issue could be addressed,  because many schools should be prioritised, although the case that was made for  Dromore Central Primary School  was very compelling and I hope that it qualifies.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It appears that it is difficult for the Department to agree  which criteria to use because no Budget has been agreed. We need to get a  Budget set fairly quickly. I understand that there may be some discussions  about whether to have a one-year Budget or a three- or four-year Budget. If we  are dealing with only a one-year Budget, there will be no prospect of a new  school because we will not be able to say with certainty that it will be built.  That would raise health and safety implications, and there is a legal  requirement to make good on this. A large number of schools, including the  school that we are discussing today, have health and safety issues. That has a  knock-on effect on maintenance because there is a backlog across the entire  education budget of approximately &pound;100 million for &ldquo;essential&rdquo;, which is the  Department&rsquo;s term, must-do health and safety maintenance. The Minister should  address that legal issue.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not wish to progress matters too long, but I wonder  whether there is an equality issue. Mr Givan highlighted the beneficial  environment that pupils at Pond   Park now enjoy. Surely,  that raises questions about the equality of provision for children across the  constituency. If it is good enough for children at Pond Park,  it should be good enough for the children of Dromore. There is an equality  issue to be dealt with.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will conclude on how schools qualify for funding. As a  member of the Education Committee, I understand that the most recent allocation  of funds was given to schools that could proceed immediately, whether fully  compliant or not. Those physically able to start work were given the money.  That brings into question the tendering process not being progressed, and that  issue was raised on several occasions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister for Regional Development may ask his education  colleague on my behalf: how much money does it take to prepare a tendering  case? Surely, we should be advancing schools to the level at which we can at  least make a decision, even if it is not prohibitive. I ask that question not  just about Dromore Central but about policy in general. Many schools are caught  somewhere in the middle of the procurement process. We ought to be able to  advance as far as we can with as little cost as we can so that, if funds are  available, we can deal with the issue. I would like to have those matters  addressed.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I call on the Minister for Regional Development to respond on  behalf of the Minister of Education.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development &nbsp;(Mr Murphy)</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank Mr Givan for securing the  Adjournment debate on the proposed newbuild for Dromore Central   Primary School. I  apologise for the Minister of Education&rsquo;s absence. She is unable to attend the  Assembly today, but my standing in for her gives the opportunity to air the  debate. I am glad to facilitate that and to address Members&rsquo; concerns about the  progress of the Dromore project. In my constituency role, I am familiar with Mr  Givan&rsquo;s picture of schools struggling to deliver quality education in the  surroundings in which they sometimes find themselves.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The debate also provides an opportunity to highlight the  significant challenges and the tough decisions that the Education Department  faces in light of its reduced capital budget allocation and the uncertainty  surrounding budget allocations for future years.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister fully recognises the difficult conditions that  the principal, staff and pupils at Dromore   Central Primary    School have to endure. She also fully appreciates  that those difficulties will be fully alleviated only by the provision of a  fit-for-purpose school building. Unfortunately, Dromore Central is not unique  in that respect. Historic underinvestment in our schools estate means that many  of our schools are in a similar position. The concerns expressed about Dromore Central Primary School  are well heard, and the Minister is acutely aware that the building of any new school  makes a significant difference to children, teachers and the wider community.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Education Department&rsquo;s capital budget of &pound;182 million  is wholly committed in the current year. The major works funding available this  year has been used to complete seven PPP projects: Belfast Boys&rsquo; Model School;  Grosvenor Grammar School; St Cecilia&rsquo;s College and St Mary&rsquo;s College in Derry;  St Mary&rsquo;s Primary School in Portglenone; St Joseph&rsquo;s Primary School in  Carryduff; and Ballysillan youth club. They have all been completed this year,  resulting in a reduction of &pound;117 million in the amount available for allocation  to conventional projects. In addition, six further conventionally funded  newbuild projects are under construction.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Members know, the Education Minister has strongly  lobbied the case for investment, and she was glad that the June monitoring  round resulted in an additional &pound;13 million for capital investment in the  schools estate. That enabled a further 13 projects to commence this financial  year and one site acquisition to be made for another project. As we are almost  halfway through the financial year, it was possible to consider only those  projects sufficiently advanced in the planning and tendering process to ensure  that the funds could be used before 31 March 2011.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate that Dromore Central, like many other schools,  was disappointed not to have been included in the announcements. However, the  Minister assures staff and parents that she would like to continue to press the  case for more money. If and when she receives funds, she will push forward with  the school building programme.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Givan raised the almost catch-22 situation of Dromore  being told not to be in the tendering process only for those schools that were  in it to be awarded funding. Departmental officials are here. I assume that that  happened because the tranche of money was not planned, and, perhaps, money that  was not expected was received in the June monitoring round, with those schools  that were most ready to go ahead suddenly becoming active projects. I am sure  that departmental officials will consider the Member&rsquo;s remarks and respond to  them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Basil McCrea asked a number of questions. Again, I will  ensure that officials respond, but he asked about the criteria for  prioritisation of projects, given the potential reduction in budgets. The  Department is developing criteria to prioritise the remaining projects on the  investment delivery plan. That cannot be finalised until the amount of future  funding is known. Hopefully, we will know that in the coming days or weeks.  That will determine the level of fine-tuning needed to identify what money is  available for competing projects. The Department will continue to engage on that  subject with interested Members as well as with members of the Committee.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Looking to the future, the spending review outcome  announced on 20 October 2010 provided a Budget settlement for the next four  years. It will now be for the Executive to shape a new Programme for Government  and a draft Budget that will set departmental spending plans. Once those plans  have been agreed, the Minister will be able to assess the outcome and the  implications for education services over the next four years.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If we are serious about renewing the fabric of our schools  estate and want to build new schools, even in this extremely challenging  financial environment, we must ensure that capital funding for the schools  estate is a top priority. It is obvious that the rate at which we can build new  schools is totally dependent on the available resources. The Education Department  is developing priorities for investment that will be finalised when future  funding levels are settled. The level of funding will determine the degree to  which competing projects can be distinguished, all of which are, no doubt,  deserving.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Those challenges are wide. Despite being acutely aware of  the problems at Dromore   Central Primary    School and other schools in every sector, the  Minister cannot give a commitment to set start dates for new projects or  assurances about the progress of any particular major works project. She  desperately wants to build new schools and has 54 projects, including Dromore  Central, which have been identified for major capital works funding. A further  114 potential projects are at various stages of feasibility study and economic  appraisal. All those schools have been identified as having serious  accommodation issues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister of Education aims to put the best interests of  children and young people at the centre of her considerations. They deserve to  be educated in a comfortable, safe and modern school. She has urged Executive  colleagues &mdash; and I can bear witness to this &mdash; to give priority to spending on  the schools estate and to ensure that she can make that possible.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Member for bringing the debate. I hope that I  was able to answer some of the issues that he raised.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Bannside</strong>:  Will the Minister do something now about the toilet facilities there? That is a  very serious matter. If there are not proper toilet facilities, dear knows what  could spread among the people. Can something be done along that line?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I will certainly pass that request on to the  Minister. I have no doubt that that will be considered very seriously. As Mr  Givan pointed out, Dromore Central urgently requires capital improvements as  well as a new school. Toilet and sanitary facilities would be considered to be  a very important issue. I know from my own experience in dealing with other  schools that similar problems have arisen. I have no doubt that the Minister  will push very hard when she identifies the capital budget available to her. It  will, obviously, be a matter of prioritisation, but I will ensure that  officials and the Minister are aware of the Member&rsquo;s concerns in that regard.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Hopefully, I have answered some of the points that have  been raised. If others have not been covered, the officials have undertaken to  study the Hansard report and to write to Members.</p>
