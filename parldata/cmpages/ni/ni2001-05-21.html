                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the course of business on 1 May I left
                the Chamber at a time when the Deputy Speaker was dealing with a

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You will be aware, Mr Speaker, that on 2
                February, and again on 12 March, the Director of Finance and
                Personnel for the Assembly wrote to all Members expressly
                forbidding the use of any room for election campaigning. It has
                been brought to my attention that the Deputy First Minister made
                part of his election video in this Building, in a room
                overlooking the Prince of Wales entrance. Will you conduct an
                investigation into what I believe is a breach of the rules and,
                indeed, the conduct to which Members — especially a Deputy
                First Minister — should adhere?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am aware that a fellow Speaker in one of
                the other devolved Assemblies took the opportunity to advise
                members of the regulations and requirements in the Chamber. As
                far we are concerned, as the Member says, regulations and advice
                have been furnished by the Director of Finance and Personnel for
                the Assembly. If Members are concerned about their own
                observation of the regulations, or of any other Member’s, they
                should, in the first instance, draw that concern to the
                attention of the Director of Finance and Personnel for the
                Assembly. I ask the Member to do that if he has particular
                concerns of the kind he describes. If some problems remain after
                that, if they are drawn to my attention outside the Chamber, I
                will certainly give advice as to how they might be properly
                followed up.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I trust that is clear for Members.</p>

                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This Bill has now passed through the various
                stages of scrutiny, and I would like to take this further
                opportunity to place on record my thanks to the members of the
                Committee for Finance and Personnel who have given this Bill
                detailed investigation and consideration.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I reiterate the comments I made at
                Consideration Stage. This is a limited but, I think, useful law
                reform measure, designed to clarify and materially widen the
                ambit of a landlord’s liability for failure to repair
                defective premises. A legal anomaly has been dealt with, and
                when the legislation comes into force this time next year, we
                will have a regime of liability which has existed for nearly all
                landlords in England and Wales since 1974.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The reasons why landlords of restricted and
                regulated tenancies do not fall within the scope of this reform
                at this time have been thoroughly debated, particularly at
                Committee Stage, and I believe that all those associated with
                this Bill have reached a consensus that to exempt such landlords
                is just about the right thing to do at this stage. Obviously it
                is not an ideal situation, but with the current state of the
                private rented sector, particularly in relation to grants and
                enforcement issues, it would be unfair to impose this burden on
                landlords who cannot achieve normal market rents. However, this
                situation would be revisited if the proposed review by the
                Department for Social Development leads to a material change in
                that sector.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend this short Bill to the Assembly.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The primary purpose of this Bill is to give
                effect to the 1993 Hague Convention on the protection of
                children and co-operation in respect of intercountry adoption.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In recent years there has been an increased
                interest in the adoption of children from abroad. The benefits
                that such a child can obtain through adoption by a family here
                can be substantial. Equally, the personal happiness and
                fulfilment of childless couples who are able to provide a good
                home for a child from abroad cannot be overestimated.
                Intercountry adoption can clearly yield enormous benefits, but
                it is necessary to ensure that the arrangements between
                countries protect the welfare of children and secure the rights
                of birth parents or other carers in the child’s country of
                orgin.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Welfare Reform and Pensions (Northern
                Ireland) Order 1999 made various changes to incapacity benefit.
                Those included more stringent contribution conditions, the
                payment of incapacity benefit rather than severe disablement
                allowance to help people disabled at birth or before the age of
                20, and the abatement of the amount of incapacity benefit when
                an occupational or personal pension was being paid.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These regulations will relax the conditions
                for receiving the benefit for some disabled people and carers.
                The contribution conditions will be relaxed for people who were
                receiving invalidity care allowance immediately before they
                claimed incapacity benefit. They will also be relaxed for those
                who receive disabled person’s tax credit and earn less than
                the lower earnings level — currently £72 a week — and for
                people who received incapacity benefit in the tax year before
                the one in which they claimed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The regulations will also make it easier for
                those incapacitated in youth to qualify for incapacity benefit,
                particularly a young person who registered for and attended a
                course of full-time advanced or secondary education or
                vocational or work-based training for at least three months
                before the age of 20. That person may be entitled to benefit up
                to the age of 25. A young person who takes up employment and has
                earnings below the lower earnings limit for a lengthy period
                before again becoming incapable of work will be able to
                requalify and do so for periods beyond the normal linking rules.
                The normal linking rules are modified for people incapacitated
                in youth who stopped claiming incapacity benefit and went to
                work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The regulations also protect people who
                return from abroad and were in receipt of benefit in the last
                tax year prior to the new claim. The regulations provide that
                the normal abatement of the amount of incapacity benefit when an
                occupational or personal pension in excess of £85 a week is in
                payment will not apply to severely disabled people in receipt of
                the highest rate care component of disability living allowance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All the changes to incapacity benefit apply
                only to new claims made after 6 April 2001. Existent
                beneficiaries at the point of change will not be affected by the
                new measures. These regulations are entirely beneficial and will
                enable a wide range of deserving groups to continue to receive
                incapacity benefit.</p>

                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is an annual Order which increases rates
                of contributory and non-contributory benefits, together with the
                various premiums which form part of the income-related benefits.
                As usual, the increases are based on changes to the relevant
                price indicators over the 12 months ending in September. Most
                social security benefits rise in the usual way, in line with the
                retail price index, which this year is 3·3%, while most
                income-related benefits, for instance, income support, housing
                benefit and income-based jobseeker’s allowance, are increased
                by the Rossi index, which is 1·6%. Pensions and some of the
                premiums which are part of the income-related benefits are
                increased by more than these percentages.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">More is being done to help people with
                disabilities and carers. The disabled child premium is increased
                by £7·40 a week above inflation, from £22·25 to £30 a week.
                This is a real increase for some of the most needy families in
                the country. From April the new disability income guarantee was
                introduced at the rate of £142 a week for a single person and
                £186·80 for couples. In addition, young adults disabled early
                in life will benefit from an extra £27·60 a week.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">More is also being done to recognise the
                enormous contribution that carers make. The carers premium is
                increased by £10 a week on top of the normal up-rating, raising
                the premium from £14·15 to £24·40. This measure will help
                many carers on low incomes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">More is being done too for pensioners. The
                minimum income guarantee was introduced to give more help to the
                poorest pensioners. This Order raises the guarantee to £92·15
                a week. The basic state pension is increased by £5 for single
                pensioners and by £8 for married couples. Widows and
                bereavement benefits rise by the same amount. The Order
                increases rates of benefit in line with inflation and provides
                additional help for those who need it most.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Morrow:</p>
                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to seek the Assembly’s approval for
                two sets of Regulations. Both arise out of the changes
                introduced by the Welfare Reforms and Pensions (Northern
                Ireland) Order 1999 and are required to ensure that parity in
                social security provision between Northern Ireland and Great
                Britain is maintained.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first set of Regulations amends the
                Jobseeker’s Allowance Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1996 as a
                consequence of the introduction of a joint claims regime for
                certain couples from 19 March 2001. I should first explain that
                the Welfare Reforms and Pensions (Northern Ireland) Order 1999
                contains provisions which require couples to make a joint claim
                for jobseeker’s allowance where neither partner has
                responsibility for a child.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Jobseeker’s Allowance Joint Claims
                Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2001 introduced these provisions
                on 19 March 2001 and apply when one or both partners were aged
                between 18 and 24 at the time the requirements came into effect.
                Under those Regulations, both members of the couple are now
                required to meet jobseeker’s allowance conditions and to be
                available for, and actively seek, work. They will both receive
                help to obtain work and will be directed to training programmes
                or New Deal assistance as appropriate. Joint claims for
                jobseeker’s allowance will ensure that both partners are
                involved in the labour market, preventing them from adjusting to
                benefit dependency at an early age. These are young people
                without children, in a position to find and take work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These Regulations ensure that couples who are
                required to make a joint claim for jobseeker’s allowance are
                treated in the same way as single claimants. This is done
                through amendment of the principal Regulations: the Jobseeker’s
                Allowance Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1996.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The principal Regulations provide for a
                claimant to be treated as meeting the &quot;availability&quot;
                and &quot;actively seeking employment&quot; conditions of
                entitlement for jobseeker’s allowance in certain circumstances
                where, in practice, the claimant is unable to meet the
                conditions for good reasons.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regulation 14 of the principal Regulations
                includes provision that a claimant of jobseeker’s allowance
                can be treated as available for employment if he and his partner
                are absent from Northern Ireland for up to four weeks, and if
                his partner qualifies for specified pensioner and disability
                premiums.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regulation 50 of the principal Regulations
                provides that a claimant will be treated as being in Northern
                Ireland during a period of temporary absence if he is in Great
                Britain for up to four weeks, or is abroad as agreed for the
                purposes of attending an interview for up to seven days.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The amending Regulations under discussion
                today extend these favourable conditions to cover a member of a
                joint-claim couple who is temporarily absent on the date of the
                joint claim for jobseeker’s allowance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regulation 19 of the principal Regulations
                includes provision that a claimant of jobseeker’s allowance
                shall be treated as actively seeking employment if he and his
                partner are absent from Northern Ireland for up to four weeks,
                and if his partner qualifies for specified pensioner and
                disability premiums.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Paragraphs 2 and 3 of Regulation 2 before us
                today simply extend these arrangements to joint claimants, so
                that they are treated as available for and actively seeking
                employment in the circumstances I have described.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Paragraphs 4 and 5 of Regulation 2 of today’s
                amending Regulations make technical amendments to existing
                jobseeker’s allowance regulations 64 and 65. These amendments
                ensure that the requirements for a 16-or-17 year-old claimant to
                be available for and actively seek employment are the same
                whether he is a single claimant or a member of a joint-claim
                couple.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We aim to ensure that joint claimants seeking
                jobseeker’s allowance are treated in the same way as single
                claimants. The changes introduced by the Jobseeker’s Allowance
                (Joint Claims: Consequential Amendments) Regulations (Northern
                Ireland) 2001 will put joint claimants on an equal footing with
                single claimants as regards labour market conditions for
                receiving jobseeker’s allowance.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am delighted to have this opportunity to
                introduce the future of soccer in Northern Ireland for debate in
                the Assembly. The debate is very timely given the progress to
                date on the initiative I launched last October to create a
                soccer strategy for Northern Ireland. Issues surrounding soccer
                have been raised and discussed in the Assembly on a number of
                previous occasions. It would be useful for me to rehearse the
                background to the soccer initiative and to clarify progress to
                date.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For some time I have been deeply concerned
                about the future of football in Northern Ireland. Under
                devolution, taking up ministerial responsibility for sport has
                provided me with the opportunity to act on my concerns.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Soccer is in serious difficulties due to a
                whole raft of problems. Grounds risk closure as they fall
                seriously short of acceptable health and safety standards.
                Matches are poorly attended. Clubs are in financial
                difficulties. There is hooliganism and sectarian behaviour by
                spectators, and the public has a poor perception of the game. I
                was convinced that we could and should find ways of overcoming
                the difficulties. We need to restore to full health the sport
                that has served all sections of our community for so long and so
                well.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland can be proud of its rich
                history of involvement in the evolution of world football. The
                local game’s governing authority, the Irish Football
                Association (IFA), is the fourth oldest association in the
                world. The Irish Football League (IFL) is the third oldest
                league. Therefore it is important to reflect that we are part of
                a game that was at the very beginning of international football.
                There was a football association here before there was one in
                Italy, Germany, Brazil, or Argentina. It is part of our heritage
                and culture, and that is also something that needs to be borne
                in mind.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland has produced some wonderful
                players, but we are now suffering from a shortage of quality
                players coming through the system. Sadly, the Northern Ireland
                international team has not participated in the final stages of
                the World Cup since Mexico in 1986. Football is part of our
                culture. It has kept going over the past 30 difficult years,
                serving society well, and we cannot allow it to go to the wall,
                which is where it is heading if nothing is done to help it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I believe firmly that there is a potential
                audience for live football here. The number of spectators who
                travel across the water to follow the big clubs such as
                Manchester United, Rangers, Celtic and Liverpool shows that the
                potential is there. I do not see our clubs ever competing with
                the big clubs at that level — or with live matches — nor do
                I see local football attracting the big crowds that it did in
                the 1950s and 1960s. Those days are probably over. However,
                football here can be developed in a complementary way to
                generate widespread interest and a following for a good-quality
                and thriving local game.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have obligations to the younger generation
                of Northern Ireland, and I would like to maximise the
                opportunities for boys and girls alike to participate in and
                enjoy the game. We need to provide the potential for them to
                progress to the highest levels if that is what they want to do.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When I considered the issues I realised that
                the way forward was not to deal with them in isolation. The
                Assembly should look towards a vision for football and see where
                the game should be in five, 10 or 20 years. What are the issues,
                and how should we tackle them? What are the problems, and how do
                we solve them? How can we improve the image of the game and
                increase spectator numbers? Can we broaden the spectator base to
                make the game attractive to women and families? What steps can
                be taken to create a welcoming and family-friendly environment?
                Can we increase access and participation? How should we go about
                developing youth football and women’s football? What does it
                take to improve the infrastructure, grounds, facilities,
                administration, coaching and funding?</p>
                <i>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those are some of the questions that arose
                during the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure’s early
                discussions about the game. There are no easy fixes. Change will
                require a great deal of effort, support and resources. However,
                if the Assembly wants to make football a thriving and successful
                sport once again, we need to plan now for the future. There is a
                huge opportunity to develop football, and that would create
                benefits for the self-esteem and image of our community at home
                and further afield. I concluded early on that progress could be
                achieved only by having a strategy for the development of the
                game. Last October I introduced the &quot;Creating a Soccer
                Strategy for Northern Ireland — views of the
                stakeholders&quot; initiative.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Notwithstanding the need for a long-term
                strategy for soccer, it was clear that some urgent measures were
                necessary to tackle the most serious health and safety problems
                at our top sports venues. There is no doubt about the
                seriousness of the problems. Substantial measures are required
                to make our sports grounds safe and comfortable for spectators
                and players. Safety at the grounds and the need to bring those
                grounds up to the standard recommended in the Taylor report in
                the wake of the Hillsborough disaster in 1989 are matters which
                could and should have been tackled more actively under direct
                rule. However, they were not.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland did not share in the
                Football Trust’s substantial funding for major schemes for
                grounds improvements that were carried out elsewhere in the
                United Kingdom in the 1990s following the Taylor report — for
                which some £600 million was made available.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was assessed then that Northern Ireland
                needed over £20 million to comply with the new safety
                legislation that was introduced in the rest of the United
                Kingdom as a result of Taylor. Under direct rule we got nothing.
                The potential for funding has been dramatically reduced, because
                the Football Foundation that administered those large sums of
                money and which did so well for the game in England, Wales and
                Scotland, but not in Northern Ireland, has been replaced by the
                Football Trust. The football trust is envisaged as an
                England-only organisation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland inherited its situation as a
                result of direct rule. However, Members will recall that last
                year I introduced an interim measure, the safe sports ground
                scheme, that was designed to implement urgent health and safety
                recommendations at football, gaelic and rugby grounds. That work
                proceeded due to some £5·3 million being made available over
                three years. I am glad to acknowledge the Assembly’s decision
                to support the allocation of £2 million last year to enable the
                Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure to speed up progress on
                those improvements.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am pleased with progress on that front, but
                I recognise that this is just the beginning and that more needs
                to be done. Nevertheless, we have a scheme running, and the
                decision to provide financial support is in our hands. That
                demonstrates the scope to achieve real progress at local level,
                progress that could not have been achieved without that local
                input.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When I announced my plans for a strategy for
                soccer at the end of last year I intended that the process
                should be open and inclusive and involve a wide spectrum of
                interest. The initiative was not just about Irish league
                football, which undoubtedly has its problems. I wanted the
                process to look at all levels of the game from the grass roots
                up.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There have been three important stages to the
                process. First, I established an advisory panel with a broad
                range of interests and experience to guide and advise on the
                development of the strategy. Second, the panel carried out an
                extensive consultation exercise with interested individuals and
                groups and the public on the issues facing football and how the
                game needs to be improved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On 5 February we published the findings of
                this exercise in a report called ‘Creating a Soccer Strategy
                for Northern Ireland — views of the stakeholders, which
                provided the basis for a conference workshop in Newcastle during
                the weekend of 10 February and 11 February.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to place on record my sincere thanks
                and appreciation to the members of the advisory panel, under the
                chairmanship of Billy Hamilton, for the substantial amount of
                work and effort they have devoted, and are continuing to devote,
                to this process. The level of time and commitment they have
                given has been much more than was anticipated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not my role, nor the panel’s, to lay
                down how things should be. Therefore it is imperative that there
                is a broad consensus from the football family on ideas about how
                the game should be developed. The panel’s role is to provide
                advice as we move along and to facilitate and guide the process
                that will translate the ideas into a strategy for action for the
                future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commissioned the ‘views of the
                stakeholders’ report to help identify difficulties in the
                game. I understand that copies have been made available to
                Members. I wanted the initiative to be open and inclusive, hence
                the commissioning of widespread consultation and the publication
                of the findings. Unsurprisingly, the exercise has generated, in
                the words of the consultants, &quot;an extraordinarily high
                level of interest and passion.&quot; It is a valuable record of
                what people think about the game. Issues such as the standard of
                facilities, structure of the game, standard of play, youth
                development, media, hooliganism and sectarianism have come
                forward as a result.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We invited delegates to take part in a
                conference workshop in Newcastle. This provided an opportunity
                to bring together 68 representatives of the key stakeholder
                groups, including representatives of the Assembly Committee for
                Culture, Arts and Leisure, to debate the issues and begin to
                develop ideas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would again like to place on record my
                appreciation to everyone involved for participating in that
                weekend. Having taken the ideas that emerged at the conference
                we are currently at the crucial stage of working on
                recommendations for the future. The advisory panel and my
                officials are actively engaged in discussions with
                representatives of football interests at various levels,
                including the Irish Football Association (IFA), the Irish
                Football League (IFL), the players and the media to formulate
                proposals across a range of issues. These discussions are an
                important part of the process and will contribute to the report
                that I expect to receive from the advisory panel by the end of
                the summer. My intention is to use that report as the basis for
                publishing a draft strategy document in September for widespread
                consultation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would be improper and unwise of me to
                anticipate the advisory panel’s recommendations, but I can
                give an indication of progress on some of the issues the report
                is likely to address.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members of the panel have led several working
                sessions involving different interest groups. I am aware that
                proposals have been produced for consideration by the panel for
                a youth development policy setting out agreed objectives and
                structures for the future of youth football in Northern Ireland.
                The proposals have been produced through representatives of the
                Irish League clubs, all of the football associations and the
                Sports Council, working together towards a common purpose.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The media, the IFA and the IFL have worked
                together to come up with practical solutions for improving media
                relations. I am told it is intended to re-establish the
                Professional Players’ Association (PPA) from the start of next
                season. That recommendation is coming from the players as a
                direct consequence of the soccer strategy process.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other ongoing work includes looking at ground
                facilities and health and safety requirements. I expect to
                receive recommendations on the need for health and safety
                legislation for Northern Ireland, taking into account the
                legislation produced in Great Britain. I anticipate that such
                recommendations will also look at the need for any new
                legislation to strengthen existing public order provisions to
                combat unacceptable behaviour at sports grounds, including
                sectarianism, which has been highlighted as a major issue for
                soccer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I have pointed out in the Assembly on
                previous occasions, sectarianism is not unique to sport or,
                indeed, to football. Sport alone cannot solve society’s
                problems. We are, however, addressing this problem within the
                strategy on a number of fronts. A working group that includes
                the Irish Football Association (IFA), the Sports Council for
                Northern Ireland and the Community Relations Council has been
                set up to identify the issues and to produce recommendations on
                what future action can be taken to rid football of the scourge
                of disruptive behaviour. When I launch the soccer strategy for
                consultation later this year, I expect there to be a range of
                options for dealing with this problem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope I have given a flavour of what the
                soccer strategy will address. There are, of course, other issues
                which I have not yet touched upon and which I expect will also
                be addressed within the strategy. There is the matter of how
                football is governed and how senior league football is
                structured and managed in Northern Ireland. These are big
                issues, not only for those who support football but also for the
                organisations at the centre. Individual clubs face problems as
                to how they might be helped in terms of future management and
                development in the community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The subject of a national stadium has also
                been raised in the context of the soccer strategy. That has
                implications for sports other than football. The debate is
                ongoing as to the viability and sustainability of such a project
                for Northern Ireland. I will be interested to see what emerges
                from the soccer strategy on the needs of football, and
                especially international football.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Inevitably some problems will be easier to
                sort out than others. There will be substantial resource
                implications for some issues, and it will be up to the football
                sector to resolve them. I am confident that the strategy
                document will provide a direction for the future which we can
                all encourage and support.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I look forward to receiving the advisory
                panel’s report and to launching the strategy document in due
                course. Discussions with the Assembly and the Committee for
                Culture, Arts and Leisure on the way forward will be an
                important part of the process. One of the most important aspects
                of today’s debate is that, as local politicians, we are
                looking at an issue together, and that has implications for our
                community. The progress we have made so far on the safe sports
                ground scheme and on the soccer strategy would not have been
                possible without devolution. There has been a lack of funding
                over the past 15 years under the football foundation. Local
                people, local politicians and local soccer interests are talking
                to each other for the betterment of football and sport in
                general and our society as a whole.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for Culture,
                Arts and Leisure (Mr ONeill):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I rise to support the motion. Our Committee
                welcomes the PricewaterhouseCoopers report and will support the
                Minister’s emphasis on ensuring an inclusive and transparent
                process of consultation. As you may recall, we raised the matter
                of consultation earlier in the year, particularly with regard to
                a series of meetings held at five separate venues. The Committee
                was concerned that people who had important contributions to
                make on the subject may have been excluded from the meetings.
                The report does not provide details as to where those five
                public meetings were held.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report does, however, appear to generate
                a significant response from those involved in the game and from
                the public. The interrelated issues that emerged came as no
                surprise. Lack of finance was perceived as a major problem, and
                the report indicates that Irish League clubs are facing
                financial difficulties, deteriorating grounds, lack of
                sponsorship, poor marketing and image problems. I understand
                that the Minister intends to address these issues in his
                strategy for sport.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the strategy place emphasis on
                additional funding and funding sources to support the game? That
                is required, but adequate financial management and sound
                business techniques are needed most in the long term. Although
                finance is important, management techniques are also important
                to ensure that maximum use is made of the available funds.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee has taken a particular interest
                in the allocation of the health and safety funds that were made
                available under the safe sports grounds scheme. On 4 December
                2000, the Minister told the Assembly that an estimated £25
                million was required to upgrade our existing stadiums. As he
                said, £5·3 million has been secured so far to undertake
                essential work. The Minister indicated that he would like to
                work on this issue. What plans has he and the Department
                prepared to ensure that health and safety funding will continue
                after the initial phase?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee hopes to visit a number of
                stadiums in Scotland this year to look at work carried out as a
                result of recommendations in the Taylor report. As Members know,
                a great deal of excellent work has been completed using Football
                Trust money. This is relevant to our situation, and the
                Committee hopes to explore this area in particular.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister is already on record as having
                indicated the Department’s intention to bring forward
                legislation to implement the Taylor report. When is this likely
                to be programmed?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The overwhelming response from the report was
                that there was a need for one governing body to take forward
                senior football. It appears that the Irish Football Association
                (IFA) and the Irish Football League (IFL) fail to work together,
                and the perceived degree of conflict between them contributes to
                the negative image of soccer here. For example, we have seen
                that a sole central authority in the South — joining the
                Football Association of Ireland (FAI) and the Eircom league —
                has benefited football in terms of increased crowds and better
                performances in Europe.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although the primary aim of the Department’s
                strategy will be the improvement of the Irish league, the
                ultimate by-product will be the production of a better
                international team. Will the Minister tell us whether the
                Department intends to create a unified governing body for
                soccer? He referred to it as a major management issue in the
                future, but is he predisposed to go in that direction?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Two important areas highlighted by the report
                are youth development and community involvement. It is vital to
                attract young people to the game and provide them with the
                opportunity to develop their skills. The report highlighted the
                sense of loss that results from young players being lured away
                to play for clubs in the United Kingdom, which are perceived as
                offering better opportunities. Therefore it is essential that
                the Department’s strategy addresses the issues of how the game
                in Northern Ireland can benefit from the development of our
                talented young players, and how they can be provided with
                opportunities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was glad to hear the Minister state that
                the advisory panel has focused on a youth development policy.
                Would he consider, as part of the strategy, similar coaching
                techniques to those employed by the Belfast Giants? Many Members
                may be familiar with this. The Giants hire professional players
                to coach young people, and this, incidentally, is an excellent
                way of establishing the sport here. They appear to be having
                some success already.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This coaching system works in two ways. Young
                players have the privilege of being coached by someone they
                admire greatly, and aspire to be like, and the ice hockey
                players are contributing to the community. The Committee was
                impressed when, during a recent public session, it heard
                evidence from the organisers of the Giants about how they went
                about their training. Perhaps we should be learning from good
                practice where it exists.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The area of community involvement is
                difficult. However, it is valid for the success of the game to
                establish links and positive loyalties with the community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of those questioned for the report, 62% rated
                the image of soccer in Northern Ireland as &quot;quite&quot; or
                &quot;very poor,&quot; and only 14% thought that it was
                &quot;quite good&quot;.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Media coverage appears to be a big issue that
                needs to be addressed. I am again heartened that the advisory
                panel has focused on that as a major issue. Has the Minister had
                any discussions with the television companies about the comments
                that were made during the preparation of the final report? Such
                discussions might influence issues even before the advisory
                panel completes its work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately, media coverage often includes
                images of sectarianism and hooliganism. While there is no doubt
                that they come from a small core of people, sectarianism and
                hooliganism exist at club and international level. The
                perception, from the report, is that those factors are
                responsible for alienating people, especially family groups,
                from the game.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee recognises and applauds the
                good work of the IFA in tackling this problem at international
                level. The Minister has been forthright in his condemnation of
                the sectarian behaviour. He also said that he will examine the
                need for legislation to deal specifically with the problem as
                part of the soccer strategy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee looks forward to being
                consulted on the draft strategy at an early date. I look forward
                to hearing the views of other Members. I support the motion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Madam Deputy Speaker, I must leave the
                Chamber to attend a Committee meeting. I believe that it is now
                protocol for Members to indicate that. I will, however, be
                monitoring the responses given.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hussey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I too endorse the strategy. During the
                drafting of the strategy, although the major tendency was to
                look at problems at a senior level, I welcomed the involvement
                of representatives of clubs at junior, intermediate and youth
                levels in the consultation process to introduce a forward
                strategy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although I welcome the Minister’s
                statement, I seek some reassurance. Mention has rightly been
                made of youth development. I am sure that the Minister realises
                that a tremendous amount of youth development in Association
                Football takes place through the junior and intermediate clubs.
                Indeed — and I respond to the Chairperson of the Committee for
                Culture, Arts and Leisure — tremendous community involvement
                is generated via the localised set-ups at the lower levels.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I seek assurance from the Minister that the
                taking forward of the strategy will involve junior and
                intermediate clubs, and the youth wings, in the strategy’s
                implementation and the provision of the necessary funding, to
                assist clubs at the lower levels in improving the standards of
                play and upgrading facilities.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hilditch:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. I thank the Minister
                for bringing this issue before the Assembly. I welcome the
                opportunity to note the report and to highlight a number of
                important issues on the subject.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This debate comes on the back of what was
                probably one of the most successful days for local soccer in the
                past 30 years — the recent Irish Cup final, when everything
                that is good in soccer was highlighted — <i>[Interruption]</p>
                </i><b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Member:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Except the result.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hilditch:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">— except the result.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The football fraternity eagerly awaits the
                final report and the recommendations that it will contain. Can
                the Minister confirm that we are still on course for the soccer
                strategy to be in place by the autumn?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was a degree of disappointment that the
                strategy could not be put in place by the close of this season
                to allow for some forward planning. However, everyone involved
                in the game appreciates the depth of consultation that was
                required. It was probably best not to be rushed; the important
                thing is to get the end product right.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The ‘Creating a Soccer Strategy for
                Northern Ireland — views of the stakeholders’ report is a
                crucial part of the process and must be welcomed. I can identify
                with many of the issues raised concerning matters over the past
                20 years, as I have had various responsibilities as a player,
                coach, referee, paying spectator and, currently, an
                administrator.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report is comprehensive and covers all
                levels of soccer and the key stakeholders in the game. The only
                criticism of the process is the contribution of some members of
                the advisory panel, and they have been made aware of the
                figures. Some members who were afforded a place on the panel may
                find participation particularly difficult because of their
                cross-channel commitments to the game. However, the majority of
                panel members should be praised for their work, and those who
                took part in the conference workshop in Newcastle should also be
                praised. It provided an opportunity for people involved in
                soccer to get together in an intense environment to give their
                honest assessment of the failures in the sport. At the end of
                the three days honesty prevailed, even among those who had gone
                to Newcastle to defend their organisations and policies over the
                years. The &quot;look at us and how great we are&quot; mentality
                was put to bed, and views which, in the past, had gone unheard
                were taken on board.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main part of the research and the matters
                on which we should be concentrating are contained in part three
                of the report, entitled ‘The Emerging Issues’. These are
                listed in bullet points. Although it has been difficult to
                prioritise them, they are listed in order of importance —
                finance, facilities, structure, youth development, community
                involvement, image, sectarianism and hooliganism. Many of these
                issues are interlinked. At the top of the list is finance, which
                is also the common denominator of the other emerging issues.
                Although it is not within the scope of the research remit to
                investigate and report on the financial state of Irish League
                clubs or any other part of the structure of football in Northern
                Ireland, it might have been prudent to do so, as that would have
                given us a real insight into the problems facing us.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Government may provide financial
                assistance to help with health and safety and other matters, but
                no one expects Government handouts just to keep clubs solvent.
                However, the Assembly should know of some factors which explain
                why many senior clubs find themselves in their current
                positions. A typical first division club, with a fortnightly
                gate of between £200 and £300, is left with £25 to £30 after
                match expenses. That is only for match day. The club then has to
                find players’ wages, ground rent, administration costs and
                electricity charges, et cetera. On top of that is the burning
                issue of rates. The rates bill for a typical first division club
                is over £4,000. That is only for the football side; it has
                nothing to do with the social club. A club that finds it
                impossible to meet its weekly commitments is charged rates at a
                commercial level. A team that plays its last home game on
                21&nbsp;April and does not play another until the middle of
                August has no income coming through its gates for a quarter of
                the year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I call upon the Minister of Culture, Arts and
                Leisure and the Minister of Finance and Personnel to deal with
                this situation immediately. If commercial property is not used,
                it should not be charged accordingly. Other sources of income
                are social clubs and sponsorships. A home sponsored game every
                fortnight would raise between £200 and £300 a game. Social
                clubs are things of the past. They were successful in the 1970s
                and 1980s when people were looking for a secure environment in
                which to socialise. Times and trends have changed, and people
                are now looking for social entertainment with much more on
                offer. Time has stood still for many social clubs. They find it
                difficult to pay their way, never mind contribute finance to
                offset the cost of sustaining soccer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is acknowledged that, in addition to the
                Government, all stakeholders in soccer should deal with reality
                when it comes to finance. Most clubs are now gearing themselves
                to live within their means. I urge the Assembly also to play its
                part.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is much to be said on the emerging
                issues. The report sets them out adequately, and they should be
                taken on board in time. I have highlighted only one aspect of
                the report, but I emphasise that there is much feeling, fervour
                and passion about football here. A large number of people await
                autumn, the finished soccer strategy, its recommendations and
                public consultation.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCarthy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once again the Assembly gives locally elected
                people the opportunity to debate issues that matter greatly to
                the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today the subject is football. It certainly
                makes a change from going over and over the old sterile
                arguments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report is informative and timely. Now
                that the Assembly is in place, we have a real opportunity to
                change, contribute to and improve football in Northern Ireland.
                The Alliance Party supports much of this report. We agree that
                competitions overwork players, who then have little or no time
                to improve their skills. Realistically, there should be fewer
                competitions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Alliance Party also has concerns about
                the structure of football in Northern Ireland, both in the Irish
                Football Association and the Irish Football League. Currently
                there is a lack of clarity in each organisation’s role. Surely
                a single governing body would make more sense. Not only would it
                remove overlap in role and responsibilities, it could cut costs
                by streamlining staff and eliminating duplication.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under no circumstances, however, can the
                Alliance Party support any question of cutting the post of the
                IFA community relations officer, who is doing an excellent job
                and very important and essential work. That must continue and be
                supported, and I ask the Minister today to give the Assembly a
                commitment that it will be so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Alliance Party — like the report —
                calls for a new stadium on neutral ground. We committed to this
                in the Programme for Government, and it forms part of our
                manifesto. It makes sense, of course, that to get the best use
                from any such sporting ground it must be multi- purpose. We do
                not want a large white elephant — even if it be on neutral
                ground.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Alliance also supports making available the
                full amount called for in the upgrading of senior clubs — the
                whole £20 million rather than the £6 million currently
                allocated. This money must only, however, be allocated as part
                of an overall strategy to improve grounds, quality of play and
                the overall experience for fans and spectators.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister and other Members who spoke
                earlier agreed that central to improving the experience for fans
                is the tackling of the scourge of sectarianism. Over 90% of
                people in the clubs felt that sectarianism had an impact. Over
                90% of people perceived to be Protestant thought that
                sectarianism affected football. It is seen as even more of a
                problem than hooliganism — and rightly so. It is a problem at
                international matches and at Irish League matches. It is a
                problem and does nothing to the credit of Northern Ireland or of
                football.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s commitment against
                sectarianism and hooliganism. It has to stop. We can tolerate it
                no longer. I have raised the matter with the Minister in the
                Assembly. I have made speeches about it, and I continue to make
                speeches. Extend the Football (Offences Act) 1991 to Northern
                Ireland. Outlaw sectarian chanting and the throwing of abuse at
                the pitch, at players and other fans. If the Minister is tired
                of hearing me say this, let him do something quickly. Only then
                will I be quiet.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, football in Northern Ireland
                has to become a family-orientated form of entertainment, and the
                sooner that is brought about, the sooner we can have a thriving
                and well-supported football and soccer industry. That will give
                the whole community something to shout about together.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the motion and congratulate the
                Minister for bringing it forward. I do, however, feel a bit
                cheated. I always do feel cheated by consultants. The Minister
                invited consultants to Parliament Buildings. They looked at the
                clock and told us what time it was. We knew exactly what
                problems existed in soccer. What we need to do is get on with
                finding the means to resolve them, rather than spending large
                amounts of money on consultants’ telling us what is wrong.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the best documents ever written about
                soccer is the Taylor report. Paragraph 59 of chapter 2 entitled
                ‘A Better Future for Football’ states</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;It is not enough to aim only at the
                minimum measures necessary for safety. That has been, at best,
                the approach in the past and too often not even that standard
                has been achieved. What is required is the vision and the
                imagination to achieve a new ethos for football. Grounds should
                be upgraded. Attitudes should be more welcoming. The aim should
                be to provide more modern and comfortable accommodation, better
                and more varied facilities, more consultation with the
                supporters and more positive leadership. If such a policy is
                implemented it will not only improve safety. There will also be
                an improvement in behaviour, making crowd control easier.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We can assume that every Member, including
                the Minister, wants to achieve those aims. They must be the
                basis from which we work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate the Minister on what he has
                done so far and on what the panel has achieved. However, there
                are many myths about. I heard what Members have said this
                morning. East Antrim Member David Hilditch has been involved in
                soccer at different levels, and he probably knows more about the
                administration side than I do. However, as a football supporter
                who goes to grounds every week, I know that people continually
                talk about the amount of games that are played and about how
                that inhibits the skills of young players. The football season
                in England ended on Saturday. I am not a Liverpool supporter,
                but Liverpool played sixty-odd games. There are four local
                players in the team— Michael Owen, Steven Gerrard, Carragher
                and Fowler — and I would defy anybody to tell me that they are
                not skilful. Those four kids played in most of the games, and we
                are continually told that it is wrong.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People pick up skills by playing the game at
                the speed that it should be played at — in a match, not on a
                training ground. Training ground practice is not the same as a
                match-day game. Players can practise things at a certain speed
                on the training ground, but on a match day they can bet that the
                opposing team will be in quickly to try to stop them from
                playing. The four kids from Liverpool have proved that. We must
                get rid of some of the myths.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another myth is that footballers in Northern
                Ireland do not coach young people. Where have people been?
                Linfield and Dundalk football clubs are involved in the Dunfield
                project whereby the players coach in the community. I am sure
                that Alban Maginness and the Sinn Féin Member Gerry Kelly know
                that Cliftonville Football Club in North Belfast has received
                money to employ a development officer to work in the community.
                Many teams in Northern Ireland do not have the money to do that.
                Some teams have found sources to enable them to do it. Of course
                teams will work and coach in the community, but they must have
                the money to do so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must get rid of these perceptions and
                myths. People must understand what is really happening in
                football grounds. We must recognise that for the past thirty-odd
                years people have committed themselves — from the chairmen and
                board members of the premiership and first division teams right
                down to the grass roots — to local soccer through the worst
                times and with no money. However, the Football Trust was set up
                in 1958. Anybody who reads the finance section of the Taylor
                report — a report written in 1989 — will find that the trust
                was drawing in £9 million a year from the three major pools
                companies. From 1958 to 1989 about £120 million went into
                football for British teams. In relation to the trust’s powers,
                the Taylor report actually says</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;football in Great Britain and Northern
                Ireland&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why did we not get the money? If we did not
                get the money, we should be asking for some of it now. If we did
                get the money, why were the grounds not improved? We must ask
                those questions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are several things that we can do. For
                example, we can look at the time at which football is played.
                Most people focus on when Linfield, Glentoran, Cliftonville,
                Distillery or Carrick Rangers are playing. We do not need to
                focus on that. We need to focus on when other people are
                playing. Amateur and junior football teams play at the same time
                that the semi-professional teams play. We must focus on that
                problem and co-ordinate the games.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not just a matter of Government or the
                Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure facilitating the
                process. We need to tell those in the Irish Football Association
                (IFA) and the Irish Football League (IFL) who have
                responsibility that they must do certain things before the money
                will be made available. We are not a charity; we are here to
                save our national sport.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No one can argue that soccer is not a
                traditional sport for people from both communities. We must get
                people back into football grounds, and we must improve the
                quality of play. Most people think that the quality of play in
                the Irish Premier League is not very good. I watch the games
                every week, and I can assure Members that the quality is good.
                However, the League does not get proper media coverage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is also a focus on sectarianism. We are
                told that sectarianism is an evil in sport and that it keeps
                away the crowds. How does that explain the large crowds who
                watch Linfield play Cliftonville? Do one team’s fans really
                stay away because of the sectarianism of the opposing fans?
                There has been little trouble in the past few years. The
                football clubs have made an effort, as have the IFA and the IFL,
                and that should be recognised. The way to get rid of hooliganism
                and sectarianism is to implement the recommendations contained
                in the Taylor report. The report recommends all-seater stadiums
                and a ticketing system that means that people should purchase
                tickets in their own name, that the tickets should be numbered
                and that people should have to sit in the allocated seats. If
                that happened, CCTV could show where the trouble was, and it
                could be quickly eradicated. We must focus on such improvements,
                but first we must get the crowds back to football.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been talk about developing junior
                soccer. In England, football academies have been set up because
                of the cost of buying players. The Football Association has set
                up its own school of excellence. We should do that in Northern
                Ireland, and we should also set up football academies in each of
                the six counties. That is the way to develop soccer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People have suggested that we could restrict
                the opportunities for young players to move across the water.
                That is nonsense. Most parents who know that Liverpool,
                Manchester United, Leeds, Arsenal or Newcastle football clubs
                are interested in their child get pound signs in front of their
                eyes. In England, Arsenal paid £1 million for a
                fourteen-year-old — nobody here can compete with that. We must
                ensure that players who do not make it in England have somewhere
                to go in the Irish Premier League if they come back to Northern
                Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We cannot compete with the money in England,
                where clubs get billions of pounds for television coverage. We
                do not have that potential, so we need to understand what we
                have, how we can market it and what it is worth. We should not
                inhibit young players from Northern Ireland, who are the future
                of the international team, from going to England. If those
                children will be better players as a result of going over there,
                that is in the interest of Northern Ireland. Local clubs must
                make sure that they get players at the standard that they need.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept what Mr Hilditch said about local
                councils. I did not realise that rates were paid on the football
                side alone — I thought that rates were paid for the social
                clubs. We need to address that, but local councils should look
                at what the football clubs can do for them. We should also
                consider the fact that local councils subsidise leisure centres
                and theatres that probably do not draw the crowds that football
                grounds would, if we packaged football properly. Local councils
                should look at how they could subsidise football grounds and
                clubs. Belfast City Council would have a problem, because there
                are four football teams, but the council should examine ways of
                resolving it.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister said that many football fans
                leave these shores on a weekly basis to go to matches in
                Scotland and England. I have spoken to staff at the airports and
                ports, who tell me that approximately 5,500 fans leave these
                shores every week. If that figure is multiplied by the 38
                matches in the Premier League, it gives some idea of how many
                people from here attend those matches.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important that the Department of
                Culture, Arts and Leisure shows leadership. I said earlier that
                I did not think that we should facilitate this strategy, but
                rather we should show leadership and tell people what they need
                to do. I am not advocating dictatorship, but we should resolve
                problems. I do not want this strategy — and I am sure other
                Members do not want it — simply because two bodies cannot
                agree. The Assembly must agree on what should be done and must
                ensure that people understand what needs to happen.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The document discusses the &quot;image of
                soccer&quot;, and I am not sure what that refers to. It may be a
                reference to the quality of play by the teams or individual
                players, or it may refer to the image the fans bring to the
                game. Whatever it refers to, the image of football must be
                improved. Family membership and disabled supporters must be
                looked after, and grounds must be fitted out to ensure the
                safety of those people. That is outlined in the Taylor report,
                and it is important that we work on it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My recommendation is that we proceed and that
                we look to the Taylor report for guidance. Did we or did we not
                receive money, and, if we did, has it been used for ground
                improvements? The report refers to football in Great Britain and
                Northern Ireland, so if we did not receive money, we should be
                asking for it now. Other changes that involve taxes, people
                going through turnstiles not being charged VAT, and so forth can
                be dealt with by the British Government at Westminster. Rates
                can be dealt with locally.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Government must come up with a scheme
                whereby businessmen are encouraged to invest in football. The
                Taylor report mentions one manager who took his children to a
                Tottenham Hotspur game where McDonald’s burgers were on sale.
                I do not think that we will get a McDonald’s in every football
                ground in Northern Ireland, but businesses must be asked to
                start putting money back into football here. Club chairmen and
                directors must be asked to examine the vision for football.
                There is a clear vision for football in the Taylor report,
                chapter 2 ‘A Better Future for Football’, paragraph 59. If
                we achieve that vision, we will have achieved everything we can
                for a wonderful game.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr A Maginness:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hutchinson said that we need to get the
                crowds back to football matches in order to lift the game. But
                how do we get those crowds back, and how do we make the sport
                popular again? There is no doubt that soccer is universally
                popular. No other sport has such appeal —from South America to
                Europe to Africa. Soccer is the premier game in most countries.
                The Minister said that we were in the lead in the development of
                modern soccer, and that is true historically. However, something
                has happened along the line to cause local soccer to fall into
                decline.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This discussion document is, therefore, very
                timely, looking as it does at the problems associated with local
                soccer. This survey does not arrive at any conclusions, but it
                maps out areas of concern and suggests possible conclusions. The
                report is very useful indeed, and the Minister deserves great
                credit for initiating it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister also deserves great credit from
                the Assembly for his forthright rejection of any form of
                sectarianism in sport, particularly soccer, and for the
                political leadership that he has shown.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A number of issues need to be tackled, and
                this survey highlights them. Poor facilities is one such issue,
                and many Members have touched upon it. It is clear from the
                report that players and the public all regard poor facilities as
                a major problem. It is also clear from it that football matches,
                indeed soccer in general, are not seen as family-friendly and
                are ill-equipped in other ways as well.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are other reasons for soccer’s
                decline such as the extensive television coverage of
                high-quality professional football in Britain, Europe and
                throughout the world. Obviously, that has had an adverse impact
                on local soccer, because local soccer cannot compete with that.
                In addition, the attraction of premier league teams in Britain
                has produced a talent drain here. One cannot blame youngsters
                for being attracted to English clubs in particular. One could
                not practically or lawfully prevent youngsters from going across
                the water to improve their quality of play and their standard of
                living. There are other factors at work, some of which I have
                highlighted and are highlighted in the report, factors that are
                also at work in the Irish Republic and other parts of Britain.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have unique problems with football. The
                survey identifies hooliganism and sectarianism as major
                problems. One can see from the survey that sectarianism is
                having an impact on attendance at international football and
                Irish League games. Sadly there is a division of opinion about
                the impact of sectarianism. Those perceived to be Protestants
                say that sectarianism negatively impacts on attendance at
                international matches by 36%, and those perceived to be
                Catholics say that it is by 83%.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At Irish League games, in the Protestant
                community it is seen as 26%, and in the Catholic community, 56%.
                I use those figures to highlight the fact that the Catholic
                community is more concerned about sectarianism impacting on
                attendance at Irish League clubs and international matches. That
                must be taken into consideration. It is fair to say that
                throughout the whole community there is great concern about the
                impact of sectarianism on football. We must address that as a
                community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with Billy Hutchinson that we as
                politicians must give leadership; we must show leadership in
                relation to sectarianism. Our Minister has given a lead in that
                regard. Any strategy that we develop in relation to the revival
                of local soccer must address the problem of sectarianism. I do
                not pretend that there is an easy solution to this. The issue
                must be addressed in a practical way before we can develop a
                more universal appeal for soccer and football in Northern
                Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If one looks at the popularity of rugby and
                gaelic football, one can see that the community has to some
                extent walked away from soccer. We must examine that to see what
                is happening, not just in the Catholic or Protestant community,
                but in the whole community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would be useful to look at the emphasis
                that is put on field sports in our schools. Do our schools put
                too much emphasis on rugby and gaelic football to the detriment
                of soccer? I do not see a tremendous emphasis on soccer in any
                school, whether Catholic or Protestant, controlled or
                maintained. At both primary and secondary levels, in both
                secondary intermediate and grammar schools, we should look at
                the sort of emphasis that is placed on the development of soccer
                as part of the physical education agenda of those schools. If we
                do not get that base correct in our schools, then soccer is
                going to have a continuous uphill struggle. Therefore I suggest
                that we look at that very carefully.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am grateful for the opportunity to
                participate in this important debate. I warmly commend the
                Minister for bringing it to the House and also for his
                commitment to soccer. It is welcome that a Northern Ireland
                Minister of the Assembly should be so committed to the issue of
                local football. The soccer strategy for Northern Ireland report
                and its introduction have been widely welcomed by those in the
                game.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree largely with what the Member for
                North Belfast, Mr Hutchinson, said earlier. For many years,
                soccer provided an essential community outlet for youngsters in
                Northern Ireland to get away from and break out of sectarian
                strangleholds. It granted them the opportunity to employ their
                talents and show their sporting skills in a positive way, rather
                than engaging in other activities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly and the community in Northern
                Ireland owes soccer a great debt and should be in a position to
                repay some of that debt.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have a great sporting tradition,
                particularly in soccer, in Northern Ireland. Peter Doherty,
                Danny Blanchflower — whom, allegedly, I am called after —
                Pat Jennings and George Best all crossed the sectarian divide.
                They all played with passion and pride for their clubs and for
                Northern Ireland. I have always regarded Windsor Park as the
                home of local soccer and as the national stadium of Northern
                Ireland. It has never caused me a problem to go there, along
                with people from all religions and of no religion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remember in 1981, in the dark days of this
                Province, when other events were taking place, the Northern
                Ireland soccer team provided a real boost for people of both
                communities and all traditions with its exploits on the field.
                The team of Martin O’Neill, Sammy McIlroy, Gerry Armstrong and
                Willie Hamilton provided a cross- community element that was
                worthy of great support and touched a raw nerve in the passion
                of local football. That team lifted the spirits and the morale
                of people in Northern Ireland. I am satisfied that the team and
                the fans who supported it were made up of the Catholic and
                Protestant communities in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am surprised and disappointed to hear
                negative comments from perceived Nationalist elected
                representatives who are not able to give their support to the
                Northern Ireland international team. That is a huge mistake. It
                is incumbent on all public representatives to show proper
                leadership.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have heard Kieran McCarthy, the Member for
                Strangford, on a number of occasions holding forth on the issue
                of sectarianism. I am not aware, and perhaps Mr McCarthy at some
                stage will inform the House, what his involvement and commitment
                to local soccer has been. Is it simply to grab a cheap and easy
                headline at the expense of those who love and cherish football?
                I sometimes wonder if Kieran McCarthy would know if a ball were
                blown up or stuffed, given some of his less informed comments.</p>

                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Kennedy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No doubt he will inform the House when he
                gets an available moment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have some concern that attempts are being
                made to undermine Windsor Park as the national stadium of
                Northern Ireland. We should recognise the very strenuous efforts
                made by the International Football Association (IFA) and others
                and Linfield Football Club in creating neutral conditions and
                being actively opposed to sectarianism at Windsor Park. I firmly
                believe that Windsor Park should continue to be developed as the
                national stadium for Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mention of the national stadium project
                brings forward the idea that it can be a multisport facility.
                There are considerable objections from the GAA to that. The
                playing of any other code would appear to rule out the GAA’s
                sharing a multi-purpose stadium. However, that remains to be
                seen.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will say in respect of Alban Maginness’s
                comments on the GAA that it is not unfair to remind him that
                Gaelic sport is almost exclusively Catholic and Nationalist.
                That is a fair point to raise, and to draw to his attention,
                when he makes a comparison with local soccer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A plea should be made and supported for
                available moneys to be provided to local clubs. I am thinking of
                Irish League clubs, intermediate clubs, youth clubs — indeed,
                the full range. I include in that Newry Town football club,
                Armagh City football club and Loughgall in my constituency. A
                range of activity is provided, week in, week out, day in, day
                out, to develop young people’s soccer skills and give them an
                outlet for their abilities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to see schools’ football and the
                football of other leagues cherished and developed. I take the
                point raised by Alban Maginness that in our schools, a greater
                emphasis should, perhaps, be placed on local soccer by those in
                charge. Every encouragement should be given. Broadly speaking, I
                welcome the strategy. I wish the Minister well and trust that
                something will be done to preserve and cherish local football.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome this report as an interim move. I
                am rather disappointed that it did not start with the Taylor
                report of twelve years ago, which is generally regarded as the
                vision statement for football. It is disappointing to find that
                PricewaterhouseCoopers did not seem to be aware of it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was rather taken aback by the fact that in
                the executive summary, the report offers no short-term or
                long-term solutions, nor does it give an estimate of costs. It
                is hoped that a strategy will emerge from within the sport
                itself. That was disappointing, given that it was supposed to be
                an exhaustive exercise in finding out what was going on in local
                soccer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not want to speak about professional
                teams in the Irish Premier League. I want to speak about rural
                teams that often take their names from townlands, teams such as
                the Dunbreen Rovers, Killen, Killymore, Derg Valley and Beragh
                Scorchers. These are really the people who live football. They
                are not paid, but they play a game weekly. Members who talk
                about the decline of football should be very aware that in the
                west of the Province the clamour is for an adequate pitch.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Strabane or Omagh council areas, there is
                a queue of people each Monday morning to book football pitches,
                but there are never enough available. There is a great demand,
                which means that instead of soccer’s being on the decline, it
                is still the most popular sport.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am asking the Minister for some very simple
                help, so that rural football teams in the west of the Province
                can have changing rooms and shelter at a match. We are not
                asking for seated stadiums. We are simply asking that football,
                which is part of the healthy living encouraged by the Department
                of Health, Social Services and Public Safety and so much enjoyed
                by young people, be promoted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am certain that the seven big premier clubs
                can look after themselves. They can get the money to create an
                image and can get the sponsorship that will help them develop
                their talents. Their talent base depends upon the people for
                whom I am lobbying this afternoon — the little rural clubs.
                Those clubs create the pool of people to supply the larger
                clubs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why has there not been a development officer
                appointed to help with the form filling and with developing the
                clubs in the west of the Province. A school of excellence should
                be set up in Tyrone and Fermanagh, where there is a very good
                league. Two or three pages in the local papers are devoted to
                the activities of the local soccer team every week.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Omagh, we used to have a very popular
                competition, called the Battisti Cup. On Saturday afternoons,
                the whole farming community stopped its work and went to Omagh
                showgrounds to see all the local football teams compete in the
                Battisti Cup. The sectarian activity of the IRA killed the
                Battisti Cup in the 1970s. Because those groups were threatened,
                the next tranche of lottery funding should be given to local
                football.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have already told the Minister that, in
                West Tyrone, the GAA got 49% of the money, and soccer got 4%. We
                all know that the GAA is sectarian and exists exclusively for
                one community. On the other hand, soccer is cross- community,
                and the next tranche of money should restore the balance and
                allow teams such as Dunbreen Rovers, Newtownstewart Rovers,
                Killymore Rovers, Killen Rovers and Beragh Scorchers to have
                basic facilities such as changing rooms. That would enable small
                rural clubs to remain active and would do more to promote
                football than many of the major professional clubs do. The small
                clubs really make a contribution, and I encourage the Minister
                to provide the basic support needed to enable football to
                thrive.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the opportunity to discuss local
                soccer. I am heavily involved in soccer at all stages. On
                Saturday mornings, I am involved in a soccer academy involving
                200 primary school children and six teams, which is completely
                mixed, both the coaching staff and the children themselves. We
                take part in soccer festivals, involving teams from all over the
                United Kingdom and from across the border. On Saturday
                afternoons, I write about soccer for some of the local papers. I
                watch teams who play in the first and second divisions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is not much wrong with football in
                Northern Ireland. I hear uninformed discussion about the state
                of the local game. There are many problems in the game, and the
                people involved in soccer are aware of them.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not see sectarianism as a problem in the
                local game. If Members want to know how to make money out of
                sectarianism, let them go to Glasgow and see what happens there,
                and they can see how money is made out of racism in soccer if
                they go to parts of England. Those problems do not exist in
                local football.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For parents who want to bring their children
                to a local soccer game the biggest problem is foul language.
                That is a bigger problem than the perceived problem of
                sectarianism.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have travelled to soccer grounds all over
                the Province reporting on games. I have gone to Donegal Celtic,
                and there were no problems, even though they made sure that I
                knew that they knew who I was. Some weeks ago I was at Lurgan
                Celtic, and I faced no problems there. The club was playing
                Linfield Swifts in one of the cup competitions. The Linfield
                team had no difficulty going there, and the Lurgan Celtic people
                had no difficulty accepting them because they were united in one
                thing — football. They were all passionately involved in
                soccer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept that Lurgan Celtic people are all
                Roman Catholics who live in a Roman Catholic area. That is
                expected in Northern Ireland. I do not go along with the talk
                that sectarianism is one of the big problems in local soccer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Irish Cup Final was a glorious occasion.
                There was a bigger crowd there than would be at an international
                football match. I wonder why. It is nonsense to say that people
                are staying away from international matches because of
                sectarianism or because they are at Windsor Park. The product on
                display is what is keeping the fans away. They do not see the
                big names. They do not see the George Bests or the Martin O’Neills
                playing in a Northern Ireland shirt. Those are the sort of
                players who attract people to a game. Perhaps if England came to
                Windsor Park, the crowds would go to see Manchester United
                players playing in an England shirt. That is what attracts
                people to games. Sectarianism does not keep people away from
                games.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At present great things are happening in the
                local soccer scene, particularly at junior level. There are
                soccer academies from one end of the Province to the other —
                not just the one that I am involved in. We were tied up with
                Coventry City for a long time, and then the Football Association
                in its wisdom decided that soccer academies should not exist
                outside a 90-mile radius of a soccer ground. Most of the premier
                division teams in England can get round that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The soccer academy that I am involved in has
                sent several players to Coventry City. Two children that I
                helped coach have signed for Coventry City. They were coached
                from when they were seven and eight until they were 15 and 16
                years old. Two of them at 17 years of age are now on Coventry
                City’s books, and that is very satisfying. All over the
                Province, from the north-west to Fermanagh, clubs are heavily
                involved in coaching children in soccer. We can take tremendous
                satisfaction from that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some Members may be surprised that I was on
                Cliftonville’s books. I stayed there for about a year until
                the late Davy Bennett told me that I was too small and too light
                and that Cliftonville was letting me go. I ended up playing for
                Brantwood for two years until it more or less told me the same
                thing. I ended up playing for Harland &amp; Wolff Welders and
                the Civil Service in the amateur league, so I know the local
                game.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are good things at all levels of the
                game: the soccer academies; the coaching; and the involvement of
                children. Linfield has a tremendous cross-community scheme with
                Dundalk and has formed Dunfield. It is working. Linfield is
                bringing children from both sides of the border to play
                football. Religion does not come into it. The children just want
                to play soccer. Those schemes are starting to pay off, and that
                can be seen through the tournaments and soccer academies. Skills
                are being developed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would be foolish, and it would be wrong of
                me were I not to acknowledge that there are some difficulties in
                the local game. However, I do not see those difficulties in the
                way that others see them. At premier division and, perhaps,
                first division level many of the difficulties have more to do
                with how the clubs are run. There is a lack of business acumen
                in the game. In the area that I come from, teams such as Larne,
                Ballyclare Comrades and Carrick Rangers all have grave financial
                difficulties. Those difficulties, how they have been managed and
                the resultant court cases have been documented, and this is not
                the only area with problems.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is an argument that some clubs in east
                Antrim should amalgamate. However, I am not sure if those clubs
                will want to give up their status. Larne will always want to be
                Larne; Ballyclare Comrades will always want to be Ballyclare
                Comrades; and Carrick Rangers will always want to be Carrick
                Rangers, so holding on to what we have is one of the local
                difficulties.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would be wrong not to acknowledge those
                difficulties. Player’s demands have been too great, and they
                have been paid too much money. However, that is changing,
                because there is no longer money in the game, and the stadiums
                are not as they should be.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So much nonsense is talked about the local
                game. We went through a period where people wanted to see a
                premier division club coming to Belfast. That was pie in the
                sky. It was absolute nonsense. Local football associations
                determine where teams play. When Derry City wanted to opt out of
                the Irish League they had to get permission from the IFA. That
                also applies to teams outside the IFA’s jurisdiction who
                wanted to play outside their own local association — they have
                to get permission to do so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Bringing in a premier division team was never
                going to work, and there were other reasons involved. For
                instance, Wimbledon — who have been relegated in any case —
                could have been playing at home against some awful team. The
                following week they could be playing away. There would not have
                been any continuity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is more important that money is poured
                into existing stadiums before we think of building a new
                national stadium. Plenty of them need to be upgraded, and they
                need to be brought up to the standard set out in the Taylor
                report, much of which has not been implemented in Northern
                Ireland. This has helped to create some of the hardship, aside
                from the difficulties arising from the way some of the clubs
                have been run. Malfunctioning and maladministration have taken
                place.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the other hand, Danny Kennedy mentioned
                Armagh City and Loughgall football clubs — two junior teams
                that are exceptionally well structured and well run. They have
                poured money into their grounds and their clubs; they have new
                stadiums and new dressing rooms. On Saturday I visited my old
                club, Brantwood, who are building a new dressing room —
                although they need a new team more than a new dressing room.
                Therefore some clubs are progressing and are looking at the idea
                of involving children from the surrounding areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When I was young and played football I was
                lucky if I got a warm bath. Sometimes, running water was a
                luxury. I had to wash in the river on many occasions. Sometimes
                that applied to those of us who were playing at a reasonable
                level. I remember when I played at Brantwood — and perhaps I
                should not reminisce in this fashion — we had a Nissen hut and
                a communal bath. The water was freezing most of the time, and 22
                players were jumping into it. Unmentionable parts were turning
                blue with the cold — so you had to get out pretty quickly. All
                of that has changed, and no one would dream of going into a
                dressing room on a park pitch that did not have a proper warm
                shower.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some questions have to be asked about the
                task force. Why have Martin O’Neill, Sammy McIlroy and Iain
                Dowey not attended a single meeting? Sammy McIlroy is the
                manager of the international soccer team. I believe he has
                resigned. Is it because he has an interest in what might happen
                when the task force report comes out? I am disappointed that the
                manager of the Northern Ireland football team did not attend a
                single meeting.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When David Hilditch and I attended the soccer
                strategy weekend in Newcastle, it was interesting to note that
                some of the people from the IFA were reluctant to join us. There
                was no sign of the international team manager, yet the former
                manager, Brian Hamilton, was there. He took part in the
                discussion and the debate. He paid his own way over and
                certainly went up in a lot of people’s estimation. Where was
                the Northern Ireland team manager?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The game needs to be restructured and
                reorganised, and I am hoping that the task force will address
                some of those issues. The biggest difficulty is that the people
                involved in the game need to look at the game itself. Perhaps
                the task force report can help those people to change the game
                from within.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a lack of business acumen, and that
                is one of the most important aspects of the local game that
                needs to be addressed. Someone has come up with the daft idea
                that we need a 20-league structure. That is not going to happen.
                Things like that will not help the game.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Football will continue to flourish in
                Northern Ireland. Thousands of people will still play soccer on
                a Saturday morning or afternoon — if we are worried about
                attendances we may have to vary the times of the kick-offs, as
                my Friend Mr Billy Hutchinson suggested. I am not sure whether
                that would be the answer. I am quite happy to go to Windsor Park
                on a Saturday afternoon, as I have a season ticket there.
                However, more often than not I am on the terraces at Loughgall,
                Armagh City, Brantwood, Dundela, Carrick Rangers and Larne,
                covering those games for the local papers. I enjoy doing that,
                and it gives me an insight into the difficulties that exist in a
                great game.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need more money to improve the stadiums,
                and we also need business astuteness in the clubs, but there is
                no sense pouring money into clubs if they are not going to
                handle their affairs correctly. Members know what I am talking
                about.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hussey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does Mr Agnew agree that in the overall
                restructuring, the junior intermediate clubs must be involved
                and that the senior clubs should be liaising more with other
                clubs? I would also like to take the opportunity of correcting
                one of Mr Gibson’s statements. He talked about the lack of a
                development officer in the Fermanagh and Western league. I
                assure him that Mr Trevor Erskine, the IFA development officer
                in that area, works with all the clubs Mr Gibson mentioned and
                does an excellent job.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Agnew:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Erskine has also worked with women’s
                football, and he has probably got more kick out of that than the
                other sort of football. He played for Glentoran and Dungannon
                Swifts at one time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Restructuring is important. The Irish
                Football Association employs 27 people to run the international
                team and the Nationwide Irish Cup. The other associations such
                as the County Antrim FA, the North-West FA, the Mid-Ulster
                League and the Fermanagh and District all run their own
                tournaments. One of the IFA’s worries in restructuring into a
                single body is what would happen to all those tournaments. It
                does not believe that it has the resources or staff to manage
                all of that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Football has an important part to play in
                developing and securing its own future. I fear that there are
                too many people in the game who are not forward thinking and who
                want to hold on to their own positions. I have some doubts about
                what the report from the task force may do. I hope it will
                encourage the football authorities in Northern Ireland to take
                the necessary steps to secure the future of local football.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no doubt about the future of
                football in general. More and more children are playing the game
                than have ever played it before; there are more coaching
                schemes, and there are more qualified coaches. There are many
                good things that can secure its future if we can sort out the
                problems in structure and organisation at the head of affairs in
                the local game. We need to get rid of some of the dead wood.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure (Mr
                McGimpsey):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been a great deal of interest and
                passion in this motion, as I anticipated. Many points have been
                made, and while I noted them, it will be difficult to respond to
                all of them. Mr Gibson made the point — although I note that
                he is not present — that he was disappointed because the
                report came up with no long- or medium-term solutions or
                costings.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He was mistaken, because this is not the end
                of the process; it is a progress report on where we are right
                now. We have had a widespread consultation process with the
                stakeholders. We had a workshop in February; we have a report,
                and we are going forward with a number of issues.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important to tell Mr Billy Hutchinson
                that the costs involved are not attributed to consultants, but
                they have been incurred in the consultation process and the
                conference, and they reflect the fact that we went out to meet
                the community at a number of venues in Northern Ireland. We
                consulted with grass-roots supporters, stakeholders, the IFA,
                the Irish Football League and representatives of schoolboy and
                youth soccer. We looked at areas such as women’s soccer and
                access for those suffering from disabilities. This has been a
                widespread consultation. It has not been a small subject to deal
                with, and it has taken time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree that we expected to be ready to
                publish our draft strategy now. We are about three months late.
                The reasons are the size of the subject and the number of topics
                that have been raised. Most of the topics that have been raised
                this morning are issues that we are familiar with. It is
                important that we do this properly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Billy Hutchinson talked about the Taylor
                report and the moneys that flowed from it for football in
                England, Scotland and Wales, amounting to some £500 million or
                £600 million. The point is that all that money has been spent.
                It is gone. That money came primarily from the football pools.
                When the National Lottery came in, the pools revenue went down.
                By the time we came into operation here about 18 months ago and
                started chasing the money, it had largely been dissipated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are now in a new situation. We have
                opportunities under the National Lottery, which provides a
                portion of funding to sport, including football. However, it is
                true to say that we are left to our own devices to some extent.
                On keeping funding moving, we are looking at presenting business
                cases to the Department of Finance and Personnel. We do not
                expect it or the Assembly to provide all the moneys, but we will
                be making business cases on funding in the future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Points were made about the development of
                rural pitches and playing fields and the smaller and
                intermediate clubs. I stress — particularly to Members who are
                local councillors — that the Recreation and Youth Service
                (Northern Ireland) Order 1986 requires each district council to
                be responsible for the development of adequate sports and
                recreation facilities in its own area. It would be appropriate
                for Members to talk to their local councillors and make those
                representations to their local councils. It is unfortunate that
                local councils often do not discharge their responsibilities,
                but members of those councils come in here and expect the
                Assembly to do it for them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill made a point about the good
                practice of the Belfast Giants. The Belfast Giants ice hockey
                team has been a spectacular success, and it has exceeded all
                expectations. It is important to say that the Belfast Giants are
                the beneficiaries of a £45 million, state-of-the-art stadium.
                That is one of the reasons why they are doing so well. Currently
                almost anything that goes on in the arena does well, whether it
                be ice hockey or some other form of entertainment. The stadium
                does a lot for the game of ice hockey, but it also gives us a
                benchmark to measure the standards that we are aiming for. It
                demonstrates that families will go out to watch live sports
                providing the facilities are of the standard that they have come
                to expect.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A number of areas have been highlighted by
                the strategy process — for example, media coverage, community
                development, how to get families in and the creation of a vision
                for football. These have all been touched on. It was wrong for
                Mr Agnew to say that there was a great deal of uninformed
                comment. I have to point out that the members of the strategy
                group of the advisory panel are not uninformed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Consultations through the IFA, IFL, schoolboy
                soccer, youth and intermediate soccer were very widespread. The
                Sports Council and education and library boards were also
                involved. It is wrong to say that those consulted were largely
                uninformed — it is quite the opposite. As a result, we have a
                very comprehensive agenda and set of issues to deal with.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Taylor report, as quoted by Mr
                Hutchinson, said that a vision for soccer was needed. This is
                about where we want football to be in 5, 10 or 20 years’ time.
                What are the issues, and how do we tackle them? What are the
                problems, and how do we solve them? That is what the process is
                about, not least because football is something of value.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I said earlier, the IFA is the fourth
                oldest football organisation in the world. England formed the
                first association, followed by Scotland, Wales and then here.
                Football is part of our culture and heritage. It also goes
                beyond Northern Ireland and is of international value.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I believe strongly that sport does a great
                deal for our image and self-esteem at home and abroad, and how
                we conduct ourselves in sport is very important. That is one of
                the reasons why the advisory panel is looking at best practice
                in other countries.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The panel went to France to look at their
                football academies. They are the present European champions and
                world champions. The panel is seeking to replicate that type of
                success here. A UK sports institute, which is part of the
                UK-wide network of institutes of sporting excellence, is planned
                in Jordanstown, where football will be one of the key sports.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I cannot answer all of the points, because
                there were so many. However, it is heartening to see such a
                widespread interest in the House. Indeed, only Sinn Féin failed
                to make a response. All other parties see football as important
                and as something that is part of the whole community, regardless
                of an individual’s background.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Alban Maginness and Mr McCarthy mentioned
                sectarianism in sport. The reason why football may suffer is
                that the two communities come together in football. They do not
                come together in Gaelic, because that largely involves one
                community only. In Gaelic sport, passions are roused, and there
                are, perhaps, instances of unsportsmanlike behaviour, but you do
                not get the same level of passion that you do in soccer, because
                soccer is an interface sport. We all feel strongly about soccer,
                and that is why it has played such an important role over the
                past 30&nbsp;years and has such an important role to play in the
                future. It is something that gives us all a common purpose.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other members, such as Danny Kennedy, talked
                about the future of Windsor Park and of a national stadium. An
                international sports stadium is one of the nine areas in the
                cocktail and is a matter for discussion. Such a facility would
                be greatly helped by the inclusion of rugby, Gaelic and
                athletics. However, it may not be possible to include those
                sports.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Gaelic sports may want to develop their own
                grounds — they have yet to give us a formal response. Rugby
                wants to leave Ravenhill but needs to determine its future yet.
                It is difficult to see how athletics could be merged into an
                international stadium while retaining the atmosphere required by
                international football.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We all feel passionately about this, and it
                has excited great interest among the general public. You only
                have to look at the attendances and responses we received when
                we took the travelling roadshow around Northern Ireland, and
                members of the public discussed the subject with the advisory
                panel. We hope to have that process completed by September. We
                will then compile a draft strategy, which will go for
                consultation to provide us with the action plan. We must get
                consensus.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Billy Hutchinson said that we should tell the
                IFA and the IFL what is going to happen and how things are going
                to be — but that is not the way forward. We have to come to a
                consensus on this. The football family has a common purpose,
                which is to make the sport thrive; to reinforce it, sustain it,
                and improve it. It is not for me or for the House to tell the
                IFA or the IFL how to improve their sport. Our task is to
                facilitate discussion and to help and support them in their
                endeavours to reinforce their sport. — [Interruption]. I am
                sorry I did not pick up the comment that was made from a
                sedentary position. I do not know what was said.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important that we go for consensus and
                not prescription. Generally speaking, prescription is
                counterproductive.</p>

                IFL to have some sort of consensus, we will still be discussing
                this issue in 20 years time. We need to be prescriptive.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although the proof of the pudding will be in
                the eating — and we have to see this strategy evolve towards
                the end of the year — it is fair to say that the IFA and the
                IFL have played a very important part in our discussions so far.
                I am very optimistic about getting something out of this
                approach that will provide us with consensus. I do not believe
                that it will take 20&nbsp;years for the IFA and the IFL to reach
                agreement. I have been very heartened by the number of areas
                that they agree on and by the ideas that they have suggested.
                Although they have a conservative image I have been heartened by
                their inventiveness, creativity and approach. It is often a
                matter of bringing ideas and people together, and that is what
                we are about. In September we expect to be in a position to
                bring forward a draft action plan for discussion. I look forward

                Subject to resources, capital funding can be made available for
                projects when economic appraisals and sufficient planning have
                been completed. Moneydarragh Primary School is one of a number
                of primary schools awaiting completion of an economic appraisal
                to determine how the school’s future accomodation needs can be
                met. My Department has identified a programme of economic
                appraisals for maintained schools in the business year 2001-02.
                I am pleased to say that Moneydarragh is included in the list of
                projects.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am sure that the Minister is aware from his
                departmental records that the number of pupils at Moneydarragh
                has increased quite substantially since 1999. I did not quite
                catch what he said about the extent to which the appraisal has
                been carried out. What progress has been made, for instance, in
                the last three months, and can the Minister give a firm
                assurance that Moneydarragh will be included in next year’s

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is vital that we go through the economic
                appraisal. When we do, planning for the project will proceed so
                as to ensure that the scheme can be considered for inclusion in
                any new starts announcement. There are procedures to be
                followed, and it is vital that the economic appraisal is carried
                out as quickly as possible so that whatever planning
                difficulties exist can be overcome. Once we do that,
                Moneydarragh Primary School will be included for consideration
                along with the others, and the Member will understand that there
                are many competing demands.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Has the commander noted the number of times
                that capital spending has been raised at Question Time and the
                widespread dissatisfaction there is over his handling of money
                for that purpose? Does he understand the disquiet, especially in
                the Unionist community — although I note that a number of
                Nationalist representatives have also raised the issue — over
                the discrepancies in the way that he has allocated capital
                building funds? When you compare last year’s allocations to
                Protestant schools with those to Catholic schools, you find that
                the ratio was three to one. This year the ratio was twice that,
                and the Executive programme funds show that the funding was 10
                times greater for schools that cater mostly for the Catholic
                community. Is the difference in the state of the buildings so
                great that he can justify those anouncements that he makes year
                after year? Perhaps he can also tell us why half the money spent
                this year went to areas where four seats are being targeted by
                Sinn Fein in the election in the west of the Province?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not sure that this relates to the
                question posed by Mr McGrady. We are continually reviewing our
                approach to all of these matters. The issue of small rural
                schools is something in which I have a keen interest. In fact, I
                have been looking at this since I took up this position. Many
                rural schools have problems and difficulties, and I appreciate
                the huge contribution that rural schools make. I also know and
                understand that there are difficulties in those schools in
                relation to levels of funding. In conjunction with CCMS and the
                education and library boards, we are continuously looking at how
                we can alleviate whatever difficulties exist.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The other point is that the small schools
                support factor in the local management of schools (LMS) formula
                targets resources at small schools. We have a paper out for
                consultation at present, and I have no doubt that this is an
                issue that will be addressed in the course of that. It is vital
                that as many people as possible contribute, as this consultation
                is going to make a very important contribution towards ensuring
                that there is fairness and equality in school funding.</p>

                published ‘Making it Work, the New TSN Annual Report’. The
                action plan covers all of my Department’s business areas and
                demonstrates that the education service already targets social
                need in a range of ways.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Among these initiatives is the TSN element of
                LMS. Targeting social need is an important element in school
                funding and is directed at need wherever it arises. In
                determining the level of resources to the school sector, 5% of
                the budget is presently top-sliced and distributed on the basis
                of levels of free school meals entitlement. In the year 2001-02
                the total amount distributed in this way will be £40 million. I
                have also provided an additional £1 million for TSN from the
                £20·36 million budget addition for schools announced in
                February.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The consultation document on a common funding
                formula, launched last month, proposes an increase in the amount
                reserved for New TSN and greater emphasis on indicators of
                educational need in tandem with free school meals entitlement as
                a measure of social deprivation. No decisions — and it is very
                important that I stress this — have yet been taken in relation
                to this, and I look forward to the responses to the consultation
                document.</p>

                one element among a wide range of TSN programmes supported by my

                TSN, which represents a 10% increase, is significant, and I am
                committed to allocating more resources to targeting social need
                if that is necessary or if the Executive make additional
                resources available. I have not made a final decision about that
                or any of the other matters dealt with in the consultation
                document. I will listen very carefully to any proposal on any of

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue is important to all of us. It is
                crucial that we complete the process of consultation as quickly
                as possible. I have set out a time span for that. I was made
                aware recently that there were concerns about the consultation
                period. The deadline of 29 June allows schools three months in
                which to respond. That is substantially in excess of the
                standard eight-week period for consultations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Briefing conferences were held at the end of
                April in each board area to explain and clarify the proposals to
                schools and to chairs of boards of governors in order to assist
                them in framing their responses. Forms based on tick-box
                responses and further written commentaries, if desired, have
                been sent to all recipients of the document. Those measures
                should help ensure that schools can stay within the timescale.
                The end of June deadline is dictated by the school summer break
                and the need for sufficient time to consider the responses and
                discuss any revised proposals with the Education Committee and
                the Executive. Adequate time must be allowed to make the
                necessary changes to operational arrangements in the Department

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I explained to the Member in my letter of
                26 April, the provisional literacy and numeracy targets set in
                1998 had to be based on the results of only one year’s
                statutory assessment. They were therefore a best estimate of
                what might be achievable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With four years’ assessment results now
                available, we considered that there were sufficient trend data
                to inform a review of the targets, most of which were,
                nonetheless, retained. In two cases, the provisional targets
                were unrealistic. First, the target for the number of pupils
                achieving level 4 and above in English at the end of Key Stage 2
                has been revised from 80% to 77%. Secondly, the target for
                pupils achieving level 5 in mathematics up to the end of Key
                Stage 3 has been revised from 85% to 75%. Those changes are not
                an indication of a reduction in standards; rather, they
                represent more realistic targets, based on the additional
                information now available as a result of four years of statutory
                assessment.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for his continuing
                interest in the issue. As we come closer to achieving full
                employment, employers are increasingly dependent on employees
                who may have serious literacy and numeracy problems. That
                information has been given to several Committees. Is the
                Minister aware that those employers have to organise their own
                classes in basic English and simple arithmetic? He must agree
                that that is totally unacceptable, given that we already have
                approximately 250,000 people with serious literacy and numeracy
                problems. Lowering targets is not the way forward.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am aware of what has been said by people in
                business and industry. I share the Member’s concern. The
                Department is greatly concerned about the issue. There are
                several reasons for it, including the transfer procedure, which
                has been shown to have a negative impact on the motivation of
                pupils who fail to obtain a grammar school place, and the
                relevance of the curriculum at Key Stages 3 and 4. Both those
                issues are being reviewed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The improving performance of the primary
                sector provides a firm foundation for improvements in the
                secondary sector. In order to get this right, it is important
                that we do the work at primary level and that we be involved in
                the different processes and projects that identify the
                difficulties. The contribution made by such things as the
                reading recovery programme is critical. When visiting primary
                schools recently, I have been impressed by the number of
                teachers involved in creating their own reading recovery
                programmes. I agree with the Member that there is still a
                considerable amount of work to be done. We are setting about
                that task.</p>

                slightly over £1 million. We have made additional funding
                available for school security: £4 million has been made
                available over the last four years specifically for that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These have taken the form of access controls
                on doors, particularly to control visitor access, internal audio
                and visual monitoring systems and intruder alarms. The measures
                are largely directed towards personal protection of staff and
                pupils and are determined on the basis of risk assessments
                carried out by individual schools.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The measures are in addition to the more
                significant capital works undertaken by boards and individual
                schools to protect school buildings, which take the form of
                fencing, closed-circuit television (CCTV), external security
                lighting, security grilles and windows and the provision of
                security stores. We are very conscious of the fact that
                year-on-year there have been burdens on the education and
                library boards and other school sectors.</p>

                wherever they are. It is vital that people understand the huge

                representatives and leaders in society make it absolutely clear

                information on education in England, Scotland and a number of
                other European countries. Substantial knowledge of these

                advisers. The review body has undertaken study visits to the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Everyone knows that the consultation has been
                the biggest by far on any educational issue in recent years. The

                receive oral evidence, meetings with representatives of business
                and commerce and has received over 1,000 written submissions.
                There has been a huge public interest in the review body’s
                work, and there have been well over a quarter of a million hits
                on the official web site.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last year the Minister received a report on
                the capital needs of the Ulster Hospital. It is now May. Can the
                Minister tell the House when a decision is going to be made?
                That is what the people who use the hospital need to hear. Can
                the Minister tell the House how long it takes to read one
                report, given that her officials met with representatives of the
                Ulster Hospital throughout the drafting of it, and especially
                since the Health Department awarded itself £2 million to deal
                with it?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is the Minister aware of how bad things are?
                The accident and emergency department at the Ulster Hospital was
                built in 1974 to accommodate 25,000 people. Today it is dealing
                with almost 80,000 people. Is the Minister aware that there are
                four patients lying on trolleys in one cubicle? Is that
                acceptable?</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for her questions. At a
                meeting on 14 December 2000 with my officials, the Ulster
                Community and Hospital Health and Social Services Trust set out
                its strategic development plan for the Ulster Hospital. A draft
                of the plan was provided at the meeting, and the Department
                received copies of the finalised document on 10 January. The
                Department is urgently assessing the detail of the plan, and
                when that is completed I will consider the options available and
                announce my decision as soon as possible. That is in keeping
                with the normal timescale for looking at the details of plans of
                this complexity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recognise the urgent pressures to increase
                bed capacity at the Ulster Hospital, and £2 million has been
                earmarked in the public service agreement to fund an additional
                20 adult beds at the hospital.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The trust has submitted an outline business
                case for the reinstatement of the Jaffa ward to provide that
                extra capacity. A decision will be taken following an
                announcement on the strategic development plan and after the
                individual business case has been assessed by Health Department
                officials. I am aware of the pressures on the hospital, and I
                will do everything in my power to ensure that this matter is
                advanced as speedily as possible.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am aware that the Minister and her
                Department know of the current situation in the accident and
                emergency department of the Ulster Hospital. My Colleague and I
                were there two days last week during that awful time, as was the
                Minister’s permanent secretary. I believe that other Members
                also visited the hospital.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Mrs Robinson has already stated, having
                seen the situation we urge the Minister to make sure that the
                timetable is expedited. A lot of things happened: some beds were
                supplied, and day wards were opened. I ask that this situation
                does not happen again.</p>
                <b>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for her comments and for
                the recognition that the permanent secretary of the Department
                visited the hospital to see the situation and to report to me at
                the end of last week. As I said to Mrs Robinson, I am very clear
                that we need to move as speedily as possible regarding this
                situation and, indeed, with other hospitals that are under
                pressure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I reiterate that the situation has arisen
                through years of continuous and historic underfunding of health
                and personal social services here. The situation cannot be
                rectified overnight. Given the work that the Department has
                undertaken with the Ulster Community and Hospitals Trust and the
                strategic plan that is now in place, I am confident that we can
                make a start.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I said to the Member on a previous
                occasion, the hospital staff have identified some elements to us
                as requiring particular attention. They identified an immediate
                need for the replacement of essential medical equipment and a
                back-up generator. They forwarded the details of the proposed
                replacement programme to my Department, the total cost being
                £1·48 million. I hope that we can move more speedily on this
                while taking forward the other aspects of the hospital’s
                needs.</p>

                benefit to the rural community in order to provide equality of

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have consulted widely on new arrangements
                for primary care in ‘Building the Way Forward in Primary Care’
                That consultation has been completed, and there were no issues
                raised about mobile health centres or their use. When I have
                considered all of the responses I will decide on the future
                arrangements in primary care as quickly as possible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At present there are a number of incentives
                to improve access to primary care services in rural areas. These
                include a rural practice payment scheme, which supports GPs in
                remote areas, a practice liablility payment scheme, which
                assists essential practices in isolated areas — doctors can be
                asked to dispense prescriptions for patients who have difficulty
                in obtaining their drugs and medicines.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is an essential small pharmacy scheme,
                which gives help to pharmacies dispensing low numbers of
                prescriptions. There are outreach clinics that can bring
                hospital services to patients in rural areas. Boards can
                organise development schemes with GPs to improve services
                locally in response to local needs. We have taken a number of
                other points on board, as the Member will be aware, in terms of
                access to health services in rural areas, through the strategic
                review of the ambulance service, for example, and through the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I know that the Minister accepts that there
                is a serious shortage of orthopaedic surgeons in Northern
                Ireland, especially in comparison with England and Scotland. Two
                young, recently appointed consultants have resigned to take up
                posts in England, while two others will job-share, which means
                that four young surgeons are leaving the National Health Service
                in Northern Ireland because they could not get adequate
                operating theatre and outpatient access in the Royal Victoria,
                Musgrave Park and Craigavon Area hospitals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even more importantly, it has recently been
                revealed that accident and emergency consultants in Craigavon
                and Antrim hospitals will cease to attend fracture clinics in
                those hospitals from 1 January 2002 in order to follow their
                speciality to Royal College standards. Does the Minister
                therefore accept that these actions will thrust the Northern
                Ireland orthopaedic service into a sudden, large and unplanned
                increase in workload, which could easily lead to a devastating
                reduction in elective orthopaedic surgery such as hip or knee
                replacement?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms de Brún:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Hendron has highlighted a wider problem
                — the shortage of consultants here, despite an increase of 22%
                since 1995. Difficulties remain in filling consultant posts in
                some specific services. With the numbers completing specialist
                training over the next three years, there is the potential for a
                further 10% increase in consultant numbers in general. Some
                local services are badly affected by the loss of even one
                consultant. Therefore, specialist medical staffing is reviewed
                regularly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My officials have been working closely with
                trust and board personnel to alleviate the current acute
                staffing shortages. Clearly, the number of orthopaedic surgeons
                per head of population here is lower than in the NHS in Britain.
                We have been increasing the number of specialist trainees over
                recent years, and we will be keeping that under review.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also understand that there have been
                difficulties in accessing bed and theatre availability caused by
                increased demand. The regional spinal surgery service at the
                Royal Victoria Hospital (RVH) will begin as soon as the theatres
                in phase one of the new RVH become fully operational. We hope
                that that will improve some aspects of the service. However, I
                totally accept that both foreseen and unforeseen changes are
                impacting on the service and that we need to keep the measures
                needed under constant review.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ag deireadh Mheán Fómhair 2000, bhí 591
                duine ag fanacht le máinliacht chairdiach. De na daoine seo,
                bhí 437 ag fanacht níos lú ná 12 mhí chaighdeán na cairte.
                Ag deireadh Nollaig 2000, an dáta is déanaí dá bhfuil eolas
                ar fáil, bhí 570 duine ag fanacht agus 414 acu ag fanacht
                níos lú ná 12 mhí.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the end of September 2000, 591 people were
                waiting for cardiac surgery, of whom 437 had been waiting for
                less than the Charter standard of 12 months. At the end of
                December 2000, which is the most recent information available,
                570 people were waiting, with 414 people waiting for less than
                one year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am concerned about the length of time that
                people are having to wait for treatment. My proposals for action
                are set out in the framework for action on waiting lists and in
                the priorities for action. This year, I have set a target of a
                50 % reduction in the number of people waiting for longer than
                the Charter standard and the complete elimination of such long
                waits by March 2003.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also set a target for waiting lists to be
                reduced to 48,000 by March 2002, as a first step towards
                bringing the numbers down to 39,000 by March 2004. That
                reduction will have a direct impact on the length of time that
                people must wait.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those are quite alarming figures. Many of the
                160 people who have been waiting more than 12 months for cardiac
                surgery are dying because of the delay. We hear that targets for
                reduction are being set. How are those targets going to be
                achieved? How can the Minister demonstrate that those targets
                can be achieved under the current Administration?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms de Brún:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the number of people who are
                waiting for operations, one of the factors is that much more can
                now be done for patients with heart disease, including those who
                have had previous operations, and the elderly. Consequently, the
                patients who have cardiac surgery tend to be older and sicker
                than was previously the case. They often need longer hospital
                stays in cardiac surgery and in intensive care in the few days
                following surgery. That has reduced the throughput of patients.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recruitment and retention of nursing staff
                trained in cardiac surgery is also a major challenge. This is a
                very specialised area, and it is a professionally demanding one
                to work in. The cardiac surgery review is addressing the matter
                in detail, and it will advise on immediate and long-term actions
                to help to strengthen the nursing complement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to improving the situation for
                cardiac patients while the review has been taking place, I have
                allocated additional funding for supernumerary nursing posts in
                cardiac intensive care to support the existing staff and to
                allow additional nurses to receive specialised training. That
                will help to increase bed capacity and, therefore, the number of
                operations possible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The boards have been using some of the extra
                waiting list moneys that I have allocated to offer cardiac
                surgery to patients who have been waiting for a long time for
                operations elsewhere. That also frees up capacity at the Royal
                Victoria Hospital for those who do not wish to travel.
                Angiography facilities will soon be open at Altnagelvin
                Hospital. That will increase overall capacity here for this
                diagnostic testing, and that will help to reduce waiting times.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have also published a framework for action
                on reducing waiting lists. I refer Mr&nbsp;Poots to the number
                of different actions contained in that. That will significantly
                impact on waiting lists in general as well as on waiting lists
                for this speciality.</p>

                grouped together, because there is not a great similarity
                between them. My surprise was confirmed by the Minister’s
                answer, which was primarily on question&nbsp;6. However, the
                Minister will share our concern that waiting lists appear to be
                extending and developing, and the problem is not being resolved.
                Hidden underneath that, there is a further waiting list to get
                on the waiting list for people awaiting serious and urgent
                operations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The setting of targets is wonderful and
                grand, but there is no point in setting targets unless they are
                achievable. What new action has been taken to reduce this
                expanding waiting list? The hospitals are chock-a- block. People

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to ensuring that the targets for
                reduction are achieved, the boards and trusts are bringing
                forward their waiting list action plans for 2001-02. I will want
                to be sure that practical and robust arrangements for achieving
                the reductions are in place. I will be closely monitoring
                progress during the year against the very specific points that
                were laid out for them in the framework that I issued in
                September 2000.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These include, for example, setting clear
                targets for reducing the number of patients waiting and the
                number of people who fail to keep appointments, thereby enabling
                others to have appointments. An improvement in efficiency should
                ensure that as many patients as possible are treated — for
                example, by making sure that waiting list information is up to
                date and that co-ordination of services is better, particularly
                between hospitals and the community. A number of other clinical,
                managerial and monitoring arrangements were laid out in my
                framework statement.</p>

                an end.</p>

                are willing to travel to Scotland for heart surgery are
                facilitated by the boards. That reduces the waiting list here

                would arise only as a consequence of additional spending in
                England for that purpose. On that basis, we have established
                with the Treasury that approximately £1 million will be
                available for measures here. That will be comparable to rate

                will get like for like with Great Britain? I assume that the £1
                million to which he referred is based on the Barnett formula.
                Can he confirm that it will not be an all-time cap but that, if
                the £1 million does not fit the requirement, the Northern
                Ireland Executive will, with judicial management, address the

                Today’s announcement is welcome to farming and related
                businesses in rural areas. I hope that the scheme will alleviate
                some of the stress that the farming community has felt. Does the
                Minister envisage a cut-off time for applications for grant aid
                under the scheme? Some farms that have been infected or have had
                animals slaughtered are no longer in operation, and the farmers
                may not be entitled to housing benefit in the normal way. Can
                they claim grant aid under the scheme as well? Cattle marts have
                been identified as an associated industry— and that is welcome
                — but could events such as horse shows and the people who make
                their living from attending and exhibiting at those also be part
                of the scheme?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I acknowledge the Chairperson’s welcome of
                today’s announcement, and I appreciate the constructive
                interest that that Committee, and others, have taken in this
                matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Businesses should register for the scheme by
                20 June. It is entirely reasonable that a date is set, given
                that the scheme is meant to address hardship that is manifesting
                itself now. The scheme is for business relief, so it will not be
                for domestic rating purposes per se. However, the Department of
                Finance and Personnel recognises, as has been reflected in
                debate here and elsewhere, that some farms have diversified,
                particularly into tourism, and so there are some businesses such
                as those offering bed and breakfast that, because of their
                scale, are paying only the domestic rate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department is, therefore, making
                provision to enable such businesses to achieve commensurate rate
                relief. However, the relief scheme has not been extended to
                domestic rates as such; that is not the case in Great Britain
                either. Members asked the Department to create a scheme to
                ensure that businesses here were in a no less advantageous
                position for relief than businesses across the water, and the
                Department has delivered that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The point about cattle marts was registered
                here in previous debates and was covered by today’s

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome today’s announcement on behalf of
                the Agriculture Committee. That Committee heard at first hand of
                the hardships that are faced by the owners and operators of
                livestock marts. Today’s acknowledgement that the Department
                closed down the marts and other businesses is welcome.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, can the Minister detail any
                additional options that were considered to provide further
                relief against the ongoing costs of these businesses such as
                insurance and rent? Will assistance be given towards any capital
                investment that marts will have to make before they are allowed
                to reopen? The announcement is welcome to businesses that are
                related to agriculture, but in the horse world, riding schools
                have been closed — do they come under that umbrella as well?</p>

                other business. This scheme is to ensure that businesses that
                can show hardship are not liable for rates — as with
                businesses across the water — during the period of hardship.

                Committees and directly to Ministers. We have tried to make sure
                that the arrangements extend assistance to businesses here
                similar to that offered to businesses across the water. That has
                been done. Questions are being asked about further assistance,
                for which there would be no cover from the Treasury or anyone

                Smaller bed-and-breakfast establishments, with fewer than six
                bedrooms, will be eligible for assistance, provided that they
                can produce evidence of hardship. We should remember that this
                is a hardship relief scheme; businesses will have to show
                evidence of hardship and evidence that the hardship was related
                to foot-and-mouth disease. To qualify for the grant, businesses
                will have to prove a 15% drop in turnover. We think that that
                figure is realistic and that it is not too exacting an indicator

                the facility for charitable and broad community purposes. The

                difficulties, and we address those in many of our spending
                programmes. There are some rate relief concessions available for
                halls that are used for wider community purposes. In the context
                of the rating policy review, we will look at those reliefs and

                Halls prove that they are being used to set up children’s
                groups, youth clubs, youth meetings, and so on, before they can
                be derated. Those responsible for the Orange Halls have to
                provide more information than the GAA has to. Surely it is
                unfair and iniquitous for the Minister not to derate Orange
                Halls while continuing to give the GAA full rate relief.</p>

                taken yet. I am reflecting the current position in terms of the
                rating regime. There is a rating policy review. That review will
                look at existing reliefs and exemptions and any possible
                revisions that may be made to them. Any hall, regardless of who
                owns or operates it, is eligible for rate relief if it is used
                for a wider community or charitable purpose. There is not, as
                the Member suggests, total derating for the GAA. I realise that
                many halls are used for a variety of activities, perhaps
                including line dancing. I do not know whether the Member
                believes that that broader community activity should be eligible

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, the programme, the particular measure
                and the intermediate funding body to which the Member referred
                are obviously part of Peace I. In due course, we will be
                conducting a full evaluation of Peace I. As the Member
                indicates, at the interim stage there were concerns, reflected
                by the MEPs among others, that not all areas were getting
                similar access to funding. In many cases that was as much to do
                with problems with applications as with the allocations
                themselves. That needs to be reflected.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Across all measures in Peace II, we are
                trying to ensure that all areas of need and all sectors are able
                to make viable applications that are worthy of support. We are
                determined to fulfil the requirements of Peace II. We cannot
                pretend that every single measure under Peace I could be
                expected to cover every need in every geographical area — it
                was just not in the nature of the scheme, and it was certainly
                not within the scope of the funding involved.</p>

                outstanding natural beauty that does not qualify for Peace II
                funding on the criterion of disadvantage? Does he agree that
                places like Killyleagh, Greyabbey, Kircubbin and Portaferry have
                great social need and should be included rather than excluded as

                much stronger arrangements in place for the monitoring
                committees, with much clearer roles. One of their key roles will
                be to agree the programme complements. We are currently devising
                them. They have to be agreed by the monitoring committees before
                we can call for applications for funding.</p>

                social need. There are criteria that we have to be seen to have
                regard to, and the monitoring committees will want to be
                satisfied about that as well.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Arrangements for the implementation of the
                new local strategy partnerships were discussed at a colloquy in
                Ballymena on 31 January. It was attended by all the
                organisations involved in the delivery of Peace I. Following
                that, the special EU programmes body (SEUPB) convened a focus
                group to draft guidelines for the formation and operation of the
                new local strategy partnerships. The SEUPB has initiated a
                consultation and information process on these arrangements,
                including a series of seminars that were held earlier this
                month. The SEUPB has now issued guidelines on the formation and
                operation of the local strategy partnerships and on the
                development of integrated local strategies.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will these new partnerships be encouraged to
                develop long-term sustainability, and will we see these
                structures being fully utilised in areas other than EU funding
                situations, giving local people a better opportunity to
                influence issues that affect their lives and that of the
                community?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not see the principles of local
                partnership working as something that can apply only to European
                funding, to be thrown away once that funding ends. I want to see
                partnership working become an integral part of how we ensure
                that local community voices are heard. They influence priorities
                for spending at local level — not just in respect of European
                funds, but of all sources of public funding. The input from
                district councils at a corporate level, and from the statutory
                agencies that operate at local level, will be important in
                developing long-term sustainability.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to comment on the failure of some
                Members to appear and ask their questions. In the early part of
                Question Time there were at least three questions that did not
                have a questioner. I beg Members to be in their seats by 2.30 pm
                for the beginning of Question Time.</p>
