      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The Assembly met at 12 noon (Mr Speaker in the  Chair).</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="1"></a>Assembly Business</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Simpson</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. You will be aware that this morning I  submitted a question for urgent oral answer that relates to reports in today&rsquo;s  &lsquo;News Letter&rsquo; that concern the actions of the former Children&rsquo;s Commissioner.  He said that language in a report should be couched in such a way as to protect  the system and its stated position that the commission played the child abuse  situation in the Republic &ldquo;quite softly&rdquo; because of &ldquo;political issues&rdquo;.  Moreover, a deal was reached between the Catholic Church and the PSNI following  discussions with the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety to  the effect that summary files only will be submitted to the police &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member should come to the point of order.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Simpson</strong>:  Under the criteria of urgency, public importance and availability of the  Minister, on what grounds was the question refused?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  That is an issue for outside the Chamber. If the Member wants to raise the  matter with me, I am happy to talk to him outside the Chamber today, tomorrow  or any time this week.</p>
      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="2"></a>Public Petitions</p>
      <p class="H4StageHeading">Victims of Institutional Abuse</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Mrs Carmel Hanna has sought leave to present a public petition in accordance  with Standing Order 22.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>: I  wish to present a public petition that relates to support for victims of  institutional abuse. It was presented to me by Margaret McGuckin and signed by  several thousand members of the public who support the campaign.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Last week, the House passed a motion that called on the  Executive to:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;commission an assessment of the extent of abuse and  neglect in Northern Ireland,  to liaise and work with the authorities in the Republic of Ireland  and to report to the Assembly&rdquo;.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Furthermore, it called on the Executive to provide  funding to support helpline and counselling services and to work through the  North/South Ministerial Council:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;to ensure that all-Ireland protections for children  and vulnerable adults are in place as soon as possible&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official Report, Vol 45, No  1, p15, col 1]</span></span>.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">for all the victims of institutional abuse in Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Mrs Hanna moved forward and laid the petition on the  Table.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I will forward the petition to the Minister of Health, Social Services and  Public Safety and send a copy to the Chairperson of the Committee for Health,  Social Services and Public Safety, Mr Simon Hamilton.</p>
      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="3"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
      <p class="H4StageHeading">North/South Ministerial Council</p>
      <p class="H4StageHeading">Environment Sectoral Format</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have received notice from the Minister of the Environment that he wishes to  make a statement regarding the meeting of the North/South Ministerial Council  in environment sectoral format.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment (Mr Poots)</strong>: In compliance with section 52 of the Northern  Ireland Act 1998, I wish to make a statement on the ninth meeting of the  North/South Ministerial Council (NSMC) in environment sectoral format, which  was held in Armagh on 30 October 2009. The  statement has been agreed with the Minister for Social Development, Margaret  Ritchie, who also attended. As Minister of the Environment, I chaired the  meeting and, with Minister Ritchie, represented the Northern Ireland Executive.  The Irish Government were represented by John Gormley TD, Minister for the  Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Council agreed proposals from the Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA) and the Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA) for  the development and publication of a common set of environmental indicators. It  is intended that publication will enable elected representatives, policymakers  and others to track progress on changes to the environment in each  jurisdiction. Ministers agreed that the common indicators will be published in  2011 as part of the North/South statistical profile or through appropriate reports  of environmental indicators by the relevant agencies.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Ministers noted that the NIEA and the EPA are developing a  joint paper on environmental research that will be brought to the next NSMC  meeting in environment sectoral format. Ministers also noted that opportunities  to maximise access to EU funding for environmental research, including the  seventh framework programme and INTERREG, will be explored. Ministers further  agreed that the environmental research information, which was available on the  aNSwer website, will be made available on the NIEA and EPA websites.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Council welcomed the continuing progress of the  implementation of the EU water framework directive on shared waters and noted  that the river basin management plans are due to be finalised by the end of  2009. The focus will then move from the planning phase to implementing the  programme of measures that will be required in order to achieve the objectives  of the directive. Co-ordinated efforts between jurisdictions towards  implementing the directive will continue.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Council noted that the North/South market development  steering group is working to exploit economies of scale in the market for  recycled materials in both jurisdictions. The chair of the group will make a  presentation at the next Council meeting. Ministers also had an opportunity to  share views on policy developments on plastic bags and chewing gum.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Council noted that a framework agreement was endorsed  by the Environment Ministers in June 2009, relating, in the first instance, to  the removal of illegally dumped waste at two priority sites at Slattenagh in County Fermanagh  and near Trillick in County   Tyrone. That agreement  will form the basis for action on the remaining 18 sites. Ministers noted that  it is expected that work on the two priority sites could commence shortly after  the award of contract, which is likely to be in early 2010. The NIEA will  prioritise the order in which the remaining 18 sites will be dealt with, based  on the risk of environmental pollution, harm to human health and other factors.  Ministers welcomed the joint concerted enforcement actions that are continuing  to target shipments of waste and noted that future action is planned.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Council agreed to meet again in environment sectoral  format in March 2010.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Before I call Peter Weir, I wish to correct something that I said earlier when  Mrs Hanna presented the public petition. The Chairperson of the Committee for  Health, Social Services and Public Safety is Mr Jim Wells, not Mr Simon  Hamilton. I apologise to the House for that mistake.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  am sure that Mr Hamilton is recovering in the darkened room in which he has  been lying since he was pushed over to Health.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Minister of the Environment for his statement.  I note that the North/South Ministerial Council discussed the serious problem  of cross-border illegal waste dumping. I appreciate that, as the Minister  indicated, actions are being taken on that. Can the Minister provide any more  detail on the actions that are being taken to tackle that very important  problem?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The Member is right to point out that illegal cross-border  dumping is a significant problem. It is largely a historical problem, and we  are not receiving considerable reports that it is ongoing.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It has been established under a framework agreement that  Dublin City Council is the competent Irish authority in this matter. It is  responsible for procuring a contract for the excavation, examination and  removal of the waste, and for the remediation of the site afterwards. That will  be done in consultation with the Northern Ireland competent  authority, the NIEA. My officials in the agency will oversee the removal  operations on each site to help ensure that the site is protected during the  works. Once those two sites are cleared, that will give us a significant amount  of information to work towards having all 20 sites cleared thereafter.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement.  There is a lot of fly-tipping going on along the border, especially in my  constituency. Was there any discussion on how our council would be reimbursed?  Currently it is dealing with that problem and meeting the cost.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am disappointed, because I thought that there was an  opportunity to talk about the North/South interconnector at the meeting. Will  the Minister give his commitment that the issue will be addressed at the next  meeting?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The member has raised two issues. First, if there is  substantiated evidence that the fly-tipping is emanating from the Republic of Ireland,  that waste will be repatriated to the Republic of Ireland,  which will be expected to bear the costs of disposing of that waste. Secondly,  the interconnector is an energy matter. Therefore, the environment sector is  not the appropriate sector to deal with that.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement, especially the fact that some EU funding  will be used. However, when we went there the other day, it was made very clear  that, if we are to influence legislation, we need to see it two years before it  starts. What steps will be taken to ensure that we know the direction and  detail being taken on the legislation that we will make in the future as part  of that environmental research in the EU?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: That matter was not discussed at the meeting; however, the  Northern Ireland Executive office is fully engaged in Brussels. It is its job to alert us to  relevant legislation in its incremental stages. Each Department then has the  opportunity to respond to that legislation, so a process is in place.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I do not know how well it works and do not believe that we  have much influence over the European Union with our small population vis-&agrave;-vis  a very large albatross of government. That is why I prefer government to be  delivered locally, either through local, regional or national government, as  opposed to submitting our interests to Europe.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I note that others are quite happy to turn around and not  to have elections that they promised to have and to walk away from the promises  they made to the electorate in June last year. That is very notable here today.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comprehensive statement and the fact that a lot of  good work is being done. In relation to the North/South market development  steering group, which is working to exploit economies of scale in the market  for recycled material, does the Minister hope that we can create a truly common  market for recycled materials in Ireland as a whole in the near future? The  establishment of a market with sensible prices would do much to stimulate the  recycling of waste here and in the Republic.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: It is better to crawl before learning to walk, and,  therefore, we should establish a unified market in Northern Ireland. I have put forward  suggestions about the establishment of a single waste authority because that  would bring clear economies of scale and marketing opportunities. We are  considering the potential for the creation of a paper mill that would service Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  We must seek to utilise all potential benefits for the interests of taxpayers  and ratepayers and bring as much funding as possible back to the waste process.  Fortunately, markets for recycled materials have recovered to 2007 levels after  taking a severe dip in 2008. However, we need to market our product better, and  that will involve good separation. If we do the job right, there will be  markets for many of our products.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  thank the Minister for the statement. The market development steering group  features in every statement on an NSMC meeting. However, it seems that those  statements are always couched in terms of reports to be presented. Is the  Minister satisfied with progress in that area? Similarly, the Minister talked  about the common set of environ&shy;mental indicators between the Northern Ireland  Environment Agency and the Environmental Protection Agency. Will the Minister  give an assurance that those indicators will compare the progress, or lack  thereof, that Northern Ireland  is making with the progress that is being made by other UK regions?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: We provide an annual fund of some &pound;1 million to the waste  and resources action programme. It works closely with businesses and supports  initiatives to increase recycling and the use of recycled material.  Opportunities to market materials increase as production of those materials  increases.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The North/South market development steering group agreed  that the market and the economic landscape have changed considerably since the  inception of the project. Therefore, although proposals for the paper mill, for  example, should be kept under active consideration, immediate progress is not  expected because the economic climate is not right. There is no point in  investing huge amounts of public money if all the professional experts are  advising that it is not the right time to do that because the market will not  sustain it. We will take qualitative advice in attempting to bring about the  best outcomes for taxpayers and ratepayers.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I  also thank the Minister for his statement, which included references to plastic  bags and chewing gum. I have spoken to people in the industry in Northern Ireland, and they favour a voluntary  arrangement on the use of plastic bags rather than the taxation route that has  been taken in the Irish   Republic. What are the Minister&rsquo;s  thoughts on that? I assume that the discussions on chewing gum were about how  to remove it from our streets rather than coming up with a new mouth-watering  flavour.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Plastic bags previously accounted for 0&middot;6% of all the  material that ends up in landfill. Plastic bags are an obvious and visible  problem; they blow down our streets and become attached to hedges in the  countryside. We have sought to encourage people to use fewer plastic bags or  use the same bags more often. As a consequence, plastic bag usage in Northern Ireland  has reduced by 38% from some 20 million a year to about 12 million a year; that  is good news. Plastic bag usage in the rest of the UK is down by 48%, which is even  better news for them.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We must press ahead and set higher targets to encourage and  cajole more people to use reusable bags. Some people have suggested that we  should use paper bags, but it has been found that paper bags are more damaging  to the environment than plastic bags and that their manufacture and delivery  leaves a greater carbon footprint. Plastic bags accounted for 0&middot;6% of all  landfill material before the reduction in their usage, and they now account for  about 0&middot;4%. A much bigger exercise must be carried out to reduce the amount of  packaging that we see in supermarkets and shops.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I want us to focus our attention on reducing the amount of  packaging, because that will have a far greater impact than introducing a  plastic bag tax levy, which will probably hit the poorest in our society the  hardest. That is my initial assessment.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The clean neighbourhoods Bill will assist with the problem  of chewing gum to some extent. However, our public realm needs to be designed  so that chewing gum can be removed. Many streets in Northern Ireland are covered with  brick paviours that are laid in sand. When paviours are laid, they look  dreadful within six months because they have been covered in chewing gum. If  chewing gum is power-washed off the paviours, the sand is also washed out and  they are disturbed. The Department for Social Development needs to look at that  problem and identify how the paviours can be deep cleansed. Despite all our  efforts to educate the public, I do not think that we will discourage everyone  in Northern Ireland  from engaging in the filthy habit of spitting out chewing gum on the streets.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I welcome the fact that the Minister has  shared views on policy developments with respect to plastic bags.  Unfortunately, his position remains flawed. That aside, climate change is a big  issue. Does the Minister have shared views with his counterpart in the South on  that issue?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I note that, although the Member indicated that my views  were flawed, he did not indicate why. If he wants to hit the poorest in our  society the hardest, that is a great departure from his party policy. Perhaps  he should discuss with his party why he wants to introduce new taxes on the  poorest and see how it responds.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I discussed climate change with my counterpart, and there  are issues on which we do and do not agree. Ultimately, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland  can have a very significant impact on the introduction of energy from renewable  sources. We are ideally placed to provide such energy in our society and  beyond. We are in general agreement that there are huge untapped opportunities  for using renewable energy sources. However, there are challenges: if we use  marine measures, people will be concerned about marine life and marine biology,  and if we use wind farms, some of the Member&rsquo;s colleagues will be strongly  opposed to that. We are prepared to press ahead in that regard, and I am  interested to see his party policy on renewable wind energy.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  I sort of welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement this morning, but, unfortunately, I  do not see much substance in the 11 small paragraphs. That is not his fault; it  was because the meeting took place with a small agenda. In light of the Member  across the way referring to climate change, does the Minister agree that, in  the interests of reducing his carbon footprint, he should reconsider the  arrangements for the meetings and relocate them to his office, as, I believe,  his ministerial colleague, the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure, has done,  or introduce some form of videoconferencing?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I welcome the enthused response from my colleague; he  makes a very valid point, because much of the work could have been done by an  exchange of papers. Perhaps the Member will raise the matter with the Office of  the First Minister and deputy First Minister and directly with the NSMC because  there is, potentially, a small industry going on. Meetings are being arranged  that do not necessarily have to take place. A lot of this is common sense that  could be addressed through exchange of letters.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I exchange lots of letters on many such issues with  colleagues in the United    Kingdom, without needing to meet them.  Outstanding issues can often be resolved by telephone, which, of course, has  considerably less of a carbon footprint than holding meetings attended by  hordes of officials.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement, in which he indicated that the Northern  Ireland Environment Agency and the Environmental Protection Agency in the Republic of Ireland are developing a common set of  environmental indicators. Will the Minister ensure that the finalised and  agreed indicators remain consistent with those that are standard throughout the  United Kingdom, so that we  can assess progress in protecting the Northern   Ireland environment in conjunction with that made in England, Scotland  and Wales?</p>
      <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr McClarty] in the Chair)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The indicators will have to be closely akin not only to  those in the rest of the United Kingdom  but to those in Europe, given that many  indicators are associated with EU directives. We are slightly ahead in those  indicators. It has been agreed that research can be published independently, so  ours may be published before the Republic   of Ireland&rsquo;s. For  example, we are working towards a deadline of publishing our river basin  management plans by 22 December. Therefore, we hope to get indicators out  sooner rather than later.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as a r&aacute;iteas. I thank the Minister for his  statement. A few issues have been touched upon. Those of us who, like the  Minister, are aware of the repercussions and ramifications of climate change  will want to see a commonality of spirit and policy development. What initiatives  have been taken by the Minister&rsquo;s Department and by the Minister&rsquo;s Department  in conjunction with the likes of DETI?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has referred to renewables and the potential  that they create for employment, and those of us who are deeply concerned about  the economic downturn would like to see &ldquo;green collar&rdquo; employment prospects  fully exploited. There is an overlap between the Minister&rsquo;s Department, which  has responsibility for climate change, DETI and other Departments on the rest  of the island. If he cannot do so here today, the Minister can, if he wishes,  provide me with more details later. I am interested in what measures or  initiatives can be taken by his Department, which is charged with mitigating  climate change. What is the potential to roll out further employment from  renewables and that &ldquo;green collar&rdquo; sector?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: My Department and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment have already done considerable work between them on developing  opportunities for the green economy in recycling and renewable energies. The  Minister of Enterprise and I recently visited Harland and Wolff, where a major  offshore wind energy farm is under construction. The scale and opportunities of  that project are extensive.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will introduce DEL  into the equation. For example, Queen&rsquo;s University is doing very advanced  research into wave energy that I hope to see for myself in the not-too-distant  future. That has generated interest from across the Atlantic.  We hope to talk to people from America  who are interested in the renewable energy opportunities here in Northern Ireland.  There is much work to be done and many opportunities to be created in the  search to identify more sources of renewable energy and to reduce our reliance  on fossil fuels.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Ba mhaith liom mo bhu&iacute;ochas a  ghabh&aacute;il leis an Aire as an r&aacute;iteas sin, agus t&aacute; ceist agam d&oacute;.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the reference in paragraph seven of the  Minister&rsquo;s statement to how the North/South market development steering group  is working to exploit economies of scale in the market for recycled materials  throughout the island   of Ireland. Will the  Minister tell us more about the steering group&rsquo;s membership and work and  whether its minutes are available online?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, will the Minister recommend to his DUP part-time  MP colleagues that they consider reducing their carbon footprints further by  abstaining from Westminster?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: At least some people&rsquo;s voices are heard through their  elected representatives at Westminster,  which has to make decisions on national security, finance, foreign affairs and  a whole range of other important issues. I welcome that fact that we have nine  DUP MPs at Westminster and that their attendance  record, lobbying efforts and speaking records, and the number of questions that  they ask, are streets ahead of the previous MPs for North   Belfast, Strangford and many other constituencies. Having nine  hard-working MPs at Westminster is to the  benefit of Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">With respect to the element of the Member&rsquo;s question that  actually relates to the statement, I advise him that the chairperson of the  North/South market development steering group is expected to make a  presentation at the next NSMC meeting. Perhaps the appropriate time to fully  update the Member and the House about the steering group&rsquo;s work will be after that  meeting.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement. There are concerns about co-operation  on fuel laundering. Will the Minister indicate what his counterparts in the Republic of Ireland are doing in their fight to stop  illegal fuel laundering and smuggling? Are they as zealous and energetic as  their counterparts in Northern    Ireland? In addition, will the Minister  indicate whether Northern    Ireland can achieve its incineration  obligations under the EU landfill directive?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Fuel laundering is a significant issue that has been  ongoing for a long time, and it causes huge environmental damage. However, my  Department does not deal directly with fuel laundering: HM Revenue and Customs  is the first port of call. When there is evidence that fuel laundering has  caused environmental damage, it is up to my Department to investigate. If a  cross-border problem is identified, for example, when materials that have been  used to launder fuel have been dumped on either side of the border, we will  work with our colleagues in the Irish   Republic to identify the  source of those materials and to pursue the individuals who have been involved  in dumping them.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The residue from fuel laundering is hugely polluting and it  has the potential to contaminate ground, surface water and land. However, given  the clandestine nature of such activities, it can be very difficult to identify  the individuals who are behind them. I will always encourage people to  co-operate with and pass information on to the relevant authorities &mdash; the PSNI,  HM Revenue and Customs and NIEA.</p>
      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="4"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
      <p class="H4StageHeading">Planning Policy Statement 7: &nbsp;Draft Addendum</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I have received notice from the Minister of the Environment that  he wishes to make a statement with respect to Planning Policy Statement 7. (PPS  7)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment (Mr Poots)</strong>: With your permission, Mr Speaker, I will now  issue for consultation a draft addendum to Planning Policy Statement 7 on  safeguarding the character of established residential areas. During the  consultation, the draft policies contained in the addendum may be regarded as  material planning considerations.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Increased housing density and concern over so-called town  cramming or garden grabbing in some areas have continued to be the focus of  much public attention and controversy right across Northern Ireland. There is already  a significant body of operational planning policy and guidance that deals with  housing development in established areas. That includes: PPS 6, &lsquo;Planning,  Archaeology and the Built Heritage&rsquo;; PPS 7, &lsquo;Quality Residential Environments&rsquo;;  PPS 12, &lsquo;Housing in Settlements&rsquo;; DCAN 8, &lsquo;Housing in Existing Urban Areas&rsquo;;  and supplementary planning guidance &lsquo;Creating Places&rsquo;. That policy and guidance  promotes high-quality design, layout and landscaping. It emphasises  sustainability, and it helps to create more balanced communities by supporting  a mix of housing tenures and house types.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The existing policy also indicates that increased housing  density should not result in town cramming. Arlene Foster reminded the Planning  Service of that in her August 2007 circular, which emphasised that the impact  of new residential development in urban areas, villages and other settlements  should be fully considered in line with existing policies. PPS 6 and PPS 7 set  out robust planning policies to protect conservation areas and areas of  townscape character. They ensure that new development harmonises with the  historic townscape and leaves the character and appearance of those areas  unharmed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In those special areas, proposals involving intensification  of site usage or site coverage are permitted only in exceptional circumstances.  Additionally, development plans can bring forward local policies for  conservation areas and areas of townscape character. That will ensure that new  development is in harmony with adjacent housing and does not detract from  environmental quality, residential amenity and established character.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The majority of established residential areas, villages and  smaller settlements do not have the distinctive character of areas of townscape  character or conservation areas. However, that does not mean that the quality  of residential environment in those areas is unimportant. Those areas can also  be vulnerable to change in the physical environment, particularly from  redevelop&shy;ment of existing houses and development on infill sites at higher  densities than that of surrounding areas.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Where the demand for smaller households through apartment  living exists, it will need to be catered for, but overdevelopment can lead to  the erosion of an area&rsquo;s character, especially where the architecture, size and  scale of the new development is not in keeping with that of the locality. New  high-density housing can have a detrimental impact on the environment, on the  amount of increased garden grabbing and the loss of green space.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Not all higher-density residential development is bad; on  the contrary, it can often be beneficial to local areas by bringing much-needed  housing. The redevelopment of derelict sites can assist with urban regeneration  and support the drive to create more balanced communities by introducing a mix  of tenures and house types.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Although we have policy safeguards to prevent town  cramming, we need to do more. That is why I have published the draft addendum.  It provides three operational planning policies, which will strengthen the  existing planning policy framework. The first two will enable better management  of proposals to redevelop existing buildings, infill vacant sites, including  gardens, and convert buildings to apartments, including those for multiple  occupancy. In particular, planning permission will not be granted to proposals  where the density is significantly higher than that found in the locality, or  where the pattern of development is not in keeping with the overall character  and environmental quality of the neighbourhood.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The draft addendum also introduces space standards. Those  will ensure that there will be adequately spaced dwelling units. This is the  first time that space standards have been introduced for private housing in Northern Ireland.  I see them as an important tool for controlling densification. The size of a  home is a key factor in determining who can live there and how they will use  the property. I want to ensure that all new housing units are sufficiently  spacious, particularly if they are to prove attractive on a long-term basis to  families with children.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to conversions, all flats must be  self-contained and not wholly at the rear of a property. Planning permission  will not be granted when the original property is under 150 sq m. Additional  policy criteria will ensure that there is no reduction in the space available  for parking.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The draft addendum is not a blanket ban on redevelop&shy;ment,  conversion, in-filling or the development of gardens. It is about the right  development in the right place in order to provide good-quality homes.  High-density development will continue to be acceptable in city and town  centres and along public transport corridors and arterial routes in cities and  larger towns. Those areas are, therefore, excluded from the definition of  established residential areas.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The draft policies retain sufficient flexibility to allow  for higher-density housing schemes through imaginative and innovative design.  They can deliver significant benefits, while continuing to ensure that new  residential schemes are sensitive in design and in harmony with the character  of established residential areas.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Flash flooding, as we saw again last week, can cause significant  damage and emotional stress and anxiety. Although my Department has already  adopted a precautionary approach in Planning Policy Statement 15 to development  that could result in increased flooding, I recognise that more can be done.  Therefore, the final operational policy set out in the draft addendum  encourages greater use of permeable paving in new residential developments.  Permeable paving is a relatively straightforward example of sustainable  drainage systems (SUDS), which can reduce the amount and speed of surface water  run-off.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The addendum provides strong, clear policy, with no room  for misinterpretation: it will strengthen the policy framework. This is the  start of a four-month public consultation. This is an important issue, and I  encourage everyone who has an interest in it to write to tell us what they  think. We will carefully consider all the responses before finalising our  policies.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for the Environment (Mr Boylan)</strong>: Go raibh  maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement, and  relay the apologies of the Chairperson of the Committee for not being here.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Committee witnesses expressed concern on several occasions  about garden grabbing. Will the Minister ensure, as a result of the consultation  responses, that the issue of garden grabbing is sufficiently addressed to  restore public confidence in the planning system and that the interpretation of  planning policy will be consistent across all divisional offices?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: That issue has improved significantly since Arlene  Foster&rsquo;s circular in 2007, as a consequence of which a significant number of  planning applications from individuals seeking to engage in garden grabbing  have been refused. This draft addendum will further strengthen and endorse that  issue, and I encourage the Committee to look at it. It is robust, and I want to  see the Committee&rsquo;s views on it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I also want to identify the public response to the issue,  because the regional development strategy (RDS) was designed not to encourage  people to exploit the opportunity of developing large gardens, but to make  proper use of and develop brownfield industrial or waste sites. However, there  was a weakness in the RDS, and certain planning policy statements have been of  considerable help in dealing with it. The draft addendum should be the final  piece in the jigsaw.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. The Speaker recently advised Whips that he intended to take  a firmer line on the use in the Chamber of phones, Blackberries and similar  devices. Even when switched to silent, they interfere with all the audio  services, including the media feed, Hansard&rsquo;s recording system, streaming on the  website, and the induction loop for hearing aid users. All such devices should  be switched off before Members enter the Chamber. If Members need to receive  urgent messages, the Doorkeepers will deliver them.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">12.45 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  am glad that, as a result of that ruling, any pearls of wisdom that the  Minister or I utter will not be lost; that would be a great loss to society.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Minister for his statement. I come from an area  that has suffered from town cramming in recent years. Does the Minister believe  that the paving that has been proposed to help to alleviate flooding will  complement the proposals that he announced in his addendum to reduce town  cramming, which will place greater pressure on our water infrastructure? It is  sensible that city and town centres and arterial routes will be excluded from  that, because they are areas of high density. Will there be separate  consultation or discussion on what constitutes a city or town centre or  arterial route for the purpose of identifying which areas will not be affected  by the proposals announced in the addendum?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The more hard covering that is laid, the more problems  there will be with water run-off during periods of heavy rainfall. A reduction  in the opportunity to establish properties in high-density areas will be of  benefit in the first instance, and permeable paving will be a considerable help  in absorbing much of the rainfall and releasing it more slowly. Consequently,  less pressure will be put on our drainage systems.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The identification of what constitutes a town centre is an  issue for development plans. If the Member is saying that there could be a  question mark over what constitutes an arterial route, we will have to look at  that issue in the consultation. We look forward to receiving responses on that.  I suspect that they will not be carried out separately, but, if that issue  manifests itself strongly during the consultation process, it will be taken  into consideration before the final policy is published.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  The Minister rightly points out that overdevelopment can lead to the erosion of  an area&rsquo;s character. That is evident in the North Road in Carrickfergus, where there  has been a rash of apartment applications and approvals. Will the Minister  advise the House of what assessment Planning Service has undertaken to  establish the proportion of current approvals that will be affected by the new  addendum? Will the draft addendum have an immediate effect, as the draft  version of PPS 21 did? If not, how soon will it be completed? We do not want to  suffer an avalanche of applications in many sensitive areas with developers  trying to get approval before the regulations are changed?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: No current approvals will be affected, because neither the  Planning Service nor the Department has powers to take back approval once it is  given. Current applications are already affected by how the documents that I  mentioned in my statement are interpreted. The planning policy statement  proposal will give greater weight to that. In the absence of the addendum being  adopted, the Planning Service will accept the proposal as a material  consideration when interpreting existing policies. Therefore, when consulting  with planners, councillors and other public representatives will have the  opportunity to make the case that this proposal has weight, as it does. It will  not take full effect until the public consultation process is concluded and I  present it before the House as a final document. Nonetheless, it should  influence planners&rsquo; decisions.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as a  r&aacute;iteas.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Minister for his statement. It brings into  focus an issue that has been around for quite a while, and, as the Minister  correctly said, one that his predecessor Arlene Foster previously issued  direction on.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">However, I require some clarity on the issue of  conversions. In his statement to the House, the Minister said:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Planning permission will not be granted where the  original property is less than 150 square metres.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">What type of conversions does that refer to?  Conversions for those with disabilities may fall into that category, and I am  unsure from the statement whether that is the case.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, the operational policy that is set out in the  draft addendum to Planning Policy Statement 7 encourages greater use of  permeable paving in new residential developments. Members who have seen that  paving and who have met manufacturers of SUDs will know of the huge advantages  of such systems and how they can alleviate some of the worst aspects of flash  flooding. Will the Department merely encourage developers to use that type of  paving, or will its use become mandatory in future planning policy?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: On the issue of conversions, I assure the Member that the  policy is not designed to discriminate against those with disabilities. If it  did, it would not pass the equality impact assessments, and I am absolutely  certain that the policy will not discriminate. However, the Department will  seek to provide further clarity and assurance on that issue during the  consultation process.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department will expect developers to use permeable  paving in many proposed developments in our towns and cities, particularly in  areas that are vulnerable to flooding. For example, Members will be aware of  the considerable flooding in parts of south and east Belfast over the past few  years, some of which is due, in large part, to the development that has taken  place in those areas over the previous five or six years. That has contributed  significantly to the water that has been caught on hard surfaces and which has  immediately been deposited into our drainage systems. The Department wants to  ensure that there will be a slower release of water from new developments when  significant rainfall occurs.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  welcome today&rsquo;s statement from the Minister as a step in the right direction at  least. However, I will qualify that welcome until more detail is provided</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has spoken about high-density development  being appropriate on public transport corridors and arterial routes, and  everyone recognises that the Antrim    Road from Glengormley to Belfast city centre is such a route. However,  I refer the Minister to the Belfast    Road and Greystone    Road in Antrim, about which Antrim Borough Council  has corresponded with his Department. Those roads have only a limited amount of  public transport travelling along them. Surely that does not mean that that  area, which, traditionally, has a particularly high townscape character, will  be suitable for high-density development?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, the Minister has stated that planning  permission will not be granted to proposals where the density is significantly  higher than that found in the locality. Will he assure the House that that  means historically significantly higher and that it will not lead to some of  the rather unfortunate developments that have been permitted in the past few  years? Otherwise, the only alternative will be to put up a sign twinning the Belfast Road with Beirut.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I always find Mr Ford to be a great encourager who always  sees the positive side of things. We always welcome positivity in the Chamber.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Thankfully, we are not heading towards Beirut, and the Department will take a  rational approach to arterial routes. It is fairly evident that high-density  develop&shy;ments already exist on arterial routes, and it is also fairly evident  where further development might be appropriate.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The draft addendum seeks to tighten up on developments and  to ensure that, for example, significant period dwellings that are located on  bus routes are not pulled down and replaced with 20 or 30 apartments. That is  the reverse of the policy&rsquo;s intention: the Member is reading into the policy  something that does not exist. The Department is clamping down on that trend,  not the other way around. The policy is not concerned with opening up  opportunities for developers to destroy period dwellings. This is an opportunity  for us to clamp down on them. It would be great if Members were more encouraged  than Mr Ford is as a result of my statement. I think that most Members probably  are.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement. He referred to established residential  areas. Will he, for clarity, provide a definition of an established residential  area? He also referred to encouraging the redevelopment of existing buildings.  Will he tell the Assembly what measures his Department will take to ensure that  that happens?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Established residential areas are neighbourhoods,  including towns, villages and smaller settlements, which are dominated by  medium- to low-density single-family housing. A full definition of that is set  out in annex A to the draft addendum.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  statement and welcome and appreciate his assurances about the intentions behind  the draft addendum. However, I am a little concerned. I am grateful that the  Minister acknowledged that there have been a number of incidents of flooding in  parts of south and east Belfast.  The need to take action on that has been well articulated.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to be positive on the issue, but in all the  developments that have taken place in south Belfast that I have had any association with,  through making representations, for example, at no time &mdash; in fact, on every  occasion &mdash; the Planning Service has actually been &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member must ask a question.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  The question relates to the fact that the planners, at all times, have said  that the develop&shy;ments would not negatively impact on the infrastructure in  relation to flooding, and so on. Although I accept the Minister&rsquo;s clear  personal commitment, can he assure the House that the fact that the Department  has given approval, and defended approvals, against local advice will be taken  on board?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The policy is about taking us a number of steps further  than existing policy, where the onus is on the Department, the Rivers Agency,  or whoever the consultee happens to be, to demonstrate that a development would  add considerably to the existing drainage system and thus cause substantial  additional problems. The draft addendum to PPS 7 places the onus on the  developer to provide a sustainable drainage system. In some respects, it shifts  the onus from the Department and the Planning Service &mdash; the statutory  authorities &mdash; to the developers. That will be of considerable help in ensuring  that there will be better drainage systems in our towns and cities.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement on the draft addendum to PPS 7.  Unfortunately, as I am further down the list, most of the good questions have  already been asked. I have an interest in the permeable paving that the  Minister referred to, and I welcome the fact that the Department is trying to  make it a requirement. Has the Minister witnessed any areas where permeable  paving is in place, and, if not, will he accept an invitation to my  constituency to visit Tobermore Concrete Products, which has been taking the  lead on that issue?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: There is substantial evidence in towns and cities across  the United Kingdom  where permeable paving has been put in place that it has made a significant  contribution to reducing water run-off. I have no doubt that quality companies  that can respond to market needs, such as Tobermore Concrete Products, would  benefit from the introduction of the policy. I would be happy to visit that  company at some point to look at the products that it is producing. I do not  wish to give any company a distinct advantage, but I am always interested to  see new development lines and companies that are taking steps that are of  considerable benefit to the environment.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">1.00 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his extremely good statement, which I welcome.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister is probably aware of my concern. The village of Dunadry has been destroyed already. Will  its character be gauged from today or from a few years back, when it was a  nice, pretty hamlet with two-storey houses and bungalows?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">How will the character and harmony of an area be gauged?  Will it be done solely from the councillors, or will there be some mechanism  for gauging from the local community?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The Member has corresponded with me on the issue of  Dunadry village. He is aware that I also met the Member of Parliament with a  delegation from the village about previous planning decisions. Issues were  raised about how developments that seemed to be contrary to the development  plan could have taken place. In such situations, questions need to be asked  about the robustness of the Planning Service. I am happy to hear those  questions, to refer them to the Planning Service and to take cognisance of them  in future developments. If something that should not have happened has done, it  should not open the door to further development in a village such as Dunadry. I  trust that that assists the Member.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The new planning reform process will consider more upfront  consultation with members of the public. Therefore, I see considerable  opportunities to consult the public, both at development plan stage and at the  stage where applications come in for individual sites.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I warmly welcome the Minister&rsquo;s draft proposals. For a long time, I was a  lonely voice on Belfast City Council on town planning. I welcome the draft  proposals as another step towards reducing the problem of town planning.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am a bit concerned, because the Minister said:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;planning permission will not be granted to proposals  where the density is significantly higher than that found in the locality, or  where the pattern of development is not in keeping with the overall character  and environmental quality of the neighbourhood.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Is the latter condition to be based on the historic  or the present character of a neighbourhood? Is the condition on density based  on what one would regard as the previous density of an area, rather than its  current density? Those are important factors to be clearly defined.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I am always glad to give the Member some company, and I am  glad that he is no longer lonely in his battle.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Part of the problem with planning is that it is a  judgemental process, as opposed to a scientific one. Where a significant amount  of new development has taken place, the judgement may well be that it has gone  so far that there is little left to save and that that is the current design of  the area. However, planners may well take the view that some of the more  original period dwellings in an area are considerable and, therefore, should  not be removed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I trust that, during the consultation process, further discussion  can be had and that we can tighten down exactly what the policy means to the  satisfaction of the Assembly and of the Planning Service, so that the Planning  Service is certain that its decisions have widespread support and have been  identified by the Assembly as the decisions that should be taken on behalf of  the public of Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, I am happy to look at the issue to ensure that  there is substantial clarity for planners in their decision-making process.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>: To  labour that point a bit, I noted that the Minister said that the size of a home  is a key factor in determining who can live in it and how the policy statement  will be used. I have noticed that one of the biggest changes in character,  which was discussed earlier, is that many settled family homes are converted  into multiple-apartment buildings where families do not tend to dwell. That has  a major detrimental impact on an area&rsquo;s entire infrastructure, for example,  schools and roads. Will the addendum redress that significantly?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister consider looking further at some form of  legislation that would allow the Planning Service to take into account the  overall impact that multiple changes have on a small area? We have noticed that  the change of character in an area is not brought about by one application. In  places such as Dunmurry, where at the most recent count, 800 applications were  made, massive changes to the overall character of the area have had a huge  detrimental impact on all the area&rsquo;s facilities.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: We have all seen the result of poor development proposals  that have been made during the past number of years. Much of that related to  the boom in house prices, when people paid considerable sums of money for land  and, consequently, tried to get as much back from their investment as possible.  That led to densification and the development of homes that were either not  necessarily suitable for or changed the characteristics of their area.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member rightly mentioned Dunmurry, and I know that he  has been actively involved there and in other areas of Lisburn, such as Belsize Road, Magheralave Road, North  Circular Road, Antrim Road,  and Ballynahinch Road,  where considerable changes have been made. That replicates what has happened in  other towns, villages and cities throughout Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am not sure that that cumulative impact would be as great  if the policy were brought forward. That is because the policy provides a fair  degree of clarity. It specifies that residential areas that have low-density  housing and are considered to be for families should retain that character.  Developments that move away from that character will normally be refused.  Therefore, the document&rsquo;s considerable clarity would prevent much of the damage  that has been done already from being repeated in the future.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is deeply unfortunate that in Northern Ireland, substantial  period dwellings in particular have been pulled down and replaced by apartments  that leave a lot to be desired. Although we cannot undo what has been done, we  hope to prevent further damage to our built environment.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>: I  too welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. My concern is that there are legal  implications when dwellings, particularly in green belt areas, have been  demolished due to various factors, such as health and safety issues or fire  damage. When a family applies for planning permission to build a replacement  dwelling, they find that no procedure to deal with that is in place. That is a  genuine concern throughout the Province, and I ask the Minister to take it on  board.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: That is not an issue for planning policy statement 7;  rather, it relates to planning policy statement 21. I agree to look at that and  to have the planning and environmental policy group examine it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, buildings in many urban areas were  demolished, and the sites were left for several years while developers watched  their assets grow. It is unfortunate for those individuals that those assets  stopped growing and started to decline, and the banks have come knocking at  their doors. The developers were not as clever as they thought. We want to  encourage development, and we do not want sites to lie vacant or remain half  developed. We will do anything that we can to encourage developers to get on  with it and progress developments that have been left in a poor state.</p>
      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="5"></a>Committee Business</p>
      <p class="H4StageHeading">Efficiency and Contingency Deficit Proposals in the  Health and Social Care Trusts</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30  minutes for the debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes in  which to propose and 10 minutes in which to make a winding-up speech. One  amendment has been selected and published on the Marshalled List. The proposer  of the amendment will have 10 minutes in which to propose and five minutes in  which to make a winding-up speech. All other Members who are called to speak  will have five minutes.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for Health,  Social Services and Public Safety (Mrs O&rsquo;Neill)</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly calls on the Minister of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety to outline the details of the efficiency savings  proposals agreed with each health and social care trust; and to ensure that the  efficiency savings proposals and contingency proposals for deficits in the  current budget of each trust will not impact on front line services.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. The Committee  for Health, Social Services and Public Safety brought the motion to the  Assembly after it became clear through media reports that the health and social  care trusts were having difficulties with their budgets. There were also  concerns that the trusts were not meeting their efficiency targets. The motion,  therefore, deals with efficiencies and deficiencies.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Another reason for the debate is the Committee&rsquo;s difficulty  in obtaining information on the extent of the deficit from the Department of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety. In a way, the Committee&rsquo;s motion is  an attempt to hold the Minister to account.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee was dismayed, to say the least, that it heard  about the deficits through the media. The Department made no effort to inform  the Committee. Instead, the Committee began to hear about bed closures, about  new mothers being asked to leave hospital nine hours after giving birth and  about other drastic cuts via newspaper reports and the trade unions. The  Committee was left in the dark, and it called on the Minister to make a  statement to the Assembly to explain what was going on. Unfortunately, the  Minister was not available to make such a statement, and the Committee was left  with no choice other than to ask the Business Committee to schedule today&rsquo;s  debate.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Over the past four weeks, in an attempt to get to the bottom  of the situation by obtaining information that the Department will not, or  cannot, provide, the Committee invited each of the six trusts to give evidence.  We learned that each trust submitted a new plan to the Department to deal with  the deficit in its budget. The drastic cuts that were highlighted in media  reports over the past few weeks had nothing to do with efficiency savings; they  dealt with how trusts will stay within budget in this financial year. The  trusts have a break-even duty, which means that they cannot overspend. They  must break even or operate with a small surplus. Under the previous system, the  trusts were allowed to operate within plus or minus 0&middot;5% of their total budget,  but that flexibility has been removed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Each and every trust faces a difficult financial situation.  The need to make efficiency savings, the break-even duty and debts incurred  from the former legacy trusts create financial pressures, which are intensified  by the increasing demand for services. Each trust told the Committee that the  demand for its services has greatly increased. I do not have time to give  examples from all the trusts, but I will cite one example from the Northern  Health and Social Care Trust to illustrate what is happening. The Northern  Trust services around 440,000 people, and, in the past two years, has  experienced a 19% increase in hospital outpatient appointments and a resultant  increase in demand for other services such as diagnostic procedures and drug  provision.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">However, the increased demand must also be measured against  the fact that each trust also recycles money and receives additional moneys for  new services that are designed to improve the Health Service. In many ways,  making efficiencies is a matter of delivering increased levels of service with  the same amount of resources. In other words, it is about being more efficient  with what is available.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee asked each trust about the duty to break even  given that the trusts&rsquo; plans straddle financial years. In evidence to the  Committee, every trust was clear that it would be better to be able to run at a  small deficit in one year in the knowledge that it could generate savings in  the following year.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The trusts indicated to the Committee that they would  prefer to have a 0&middot;5% leeway, because the targets and financial challenges are  spread over a number of years. Given that targets stretch over two or three  years, the rigidity of the duty to break even every year is causing  difficulties for the trusts.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">1.15 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Northern Health and Social Care Trust pointed out that  the trusts occasionally run at a small surplus that must be spent by the end of  the year. The trusts need to spend that surplus quickly, and that means that  that money is not always spent wisely. The Committee realised that running a  deficit from one year to the next can be dangerous and may lead to an increase  in overspend that cannot be tackled. Therefore, on behalf of the Committee I  ask that the Minister revisits that issue.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister indicate whether other systems in other  jurisdictions have a break-even duty? Will he also indicate how he will ensure  that the trusts do not end up in the same position next year? Unless someone  deals with the issue, can we expect the same media circus this time next year?  Can we expect the trade unions to be, rightly, up in arms and threatening  strikes? Will the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust again make sounds about  reducing beds and sending new mothers home after nine hours?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">On behalf of the Committee, I express my disappointment at  the press statement regarding the contingency deficit plans that the Minister  released on 27 October, given that he did not see fit to inform the Committee  of how he intends to deal with deficits in the trusts. Instead, we were left to  hear about that through a press statement. The fact that that statement was  released during recess only exacerbated the situation. The Committee  understands that the Minister was unable to be clear about the extent of the  deficits when he gave evidence to the Committee on 15 October because of the  financial situation regarding swine flu. However, once the swine flu budget had  been issued and settled, the Committee would have appreciated hearing directly  from the Minister about the proposals to tackle the deficits. Instead, the  Committee was given a one-page press statement that lacked the required detail.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Returning to the pressures that the trusts face, the  Committee has some sympathy for the trusts, and members realise just how  difficult it is for them at the moment. However, after speaking to all the  trusts, the most striking fact was that some were able to live within budget,  deliver on all or most of their efficiency plans and incur only a modest  deficit. For example, the Southern Health and Social Care Trust opened its  books this year with a deficit of &pound;4 million that it inherited from the legacy  trusts. However, it is now on target to make efficiency savings of &pound;36 million  over three years, even though, according to media reports, its deficiency  proposals were for under &pound;4 million. That is a remarkable performance.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee was impressed with the frankness of the  Southern Trust, which said that the process had not been easy. It said that it  was painful but doable and achievable. Indeed, not only has the Southern Trust  basically achieved its targets, it has done so while experiencing an increased  demand for its services and while improving its standards.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">However, the fact that targets in some of the trusts are  not being met is not always the fault of the trusts. Consider the programme for  the regional procurement of drugs. In essence, that is an excellent idea that  will generate savings through increased buying power. Yet, the trusts told us  that there has been a shortfall this year, and that is backed up by information  from the Department that the shortfall for 2009-2010 is &pound;4 million. The trusts  were relying on that &pound;4 million, which now has to be found elsewhere.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Northern Trust pointed out that the efficiencies gained  by the regional procurement of drugs are sometimes wiped out by large increases  in cost by the drug companies or by increased demand for existing and new drugs  from a growing number of patients. Will the Minister outline how the issues  around regional procurement of drugs will be addressed?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Some of the trusts&rsquo; plans for efficiency savings are  dependent on finances from other Departments or other programmes or on access  to capital funding, and there appears to be a problem with that. The problem  lies with the resettlement programmes that are dependent on revenue funding  from the Department for Social Development&rsquo;s (DSD) Supporting People programme.  All the trusts rely on making efficiency savings through resettlement  programmes. By resettlement programmes, I mean programmes that involve  resettling back into the community patients who have been in long-term  institutional care or in statutory homes.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The DSD has indicated that it is reviewing the moneys for  Supporting People. We understand that there is a difficulty with the revenue  element; however, the trusts had hoped to know how much was available so that  they could progress their own schemes. The revenue contribution is important  because it enables the trusts to provide care in the community, and if that is  constrained it will have an impact on what the trusts are able to do.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The trusts&rsquo; efficiency plans also rely heavily on moving  care and treatment away from acute care to primary and community care. The  Committee is clear that if trusts move to that type of model, there needs to be  investment in primary care across the North; it needs to be seen and be  evident. The Committee heard that there have been delays in that investment.  New primary care centres that were promised two years ago are being delayed,  and communities are worried that those have been postponed indefinitely.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I now return to the issue of cuts in administration and  management, which I think will be of great interest to people.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In giving evidence to the Committee, the Belfast Trust  noted that it could remove all of its administrative and bureaucratic costs and  still only achieve less than half of the total savings that it has to find. The  Committee accepts that the level of efficiencies that are to be delivered  require the trust to look at business areas and not just at management and  administration.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Trusts must be innovative in how they find savings, and,  quite often, that has meant finding new and better ways of doing the same thing  and increasing productivity. That is important to the Committee: staff are an asset  not only to the Health Service but to everyone across the North who uses it.  However, it is clear that productivity levels here are lower than those in Scotland, England  and Wales.  Nevertheless, the Committee and the general public expect to see that efficiencies  and deficit funding proposals are taken from management and administration as  far as possible and not from front line services.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>:  No, I am nearly out of time.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In their presentations to the Health Committee, the trusts  went to great lengths to make it clear that they have greatly reduced their  administrative staff, mainly through the review of public administration (RPA)  process. For example, the South Eastern Trust now has four assistant directors  of finance. Prior to the RPA, each trust had one financial director supported  by perhaps two assistants. The Western Trust has set a target of achieving &pound;9&middot;4  million in RPA efficiencies. The Northern Trust has provided the Committee with  evidence that administrative and clerical posts have been reduced to 271 from a  total of 506.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">When taking evidence over the past few weeks, the Committee  asked each trust to quantify how much of its turnover is being spent on  administration. It appears that most trusts are keeping administration costs at  around 4% of turnover, and, on the face of it, that seems reasonable. However,  there are some variations: the Western Trust runs at a figure of 4&middot;6% and the  South Eastern Trust has the lowest figure of 3&middot;4%. In addition, we have yet to  compare the figures with those in other jurisdictions.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member should draw her remarks to a close.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>:  I want the Minister to answer the questions raised by the motion. Given that  the new trusts have had to deal with the legacy overdrafts of the previous  trusts, find millions of pounds in efficiency savings, and do all of that with  a zero tolerance approach to budget overspends, will the Minister assure the  Assembly and the people of the North that front line services will not be  impacted upon?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will finish, Mr Deputy Speaker, by saying that although  the Committee agreed unanimously on the motion, it has not taken a position on  the proposed amendment.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I beg to move to the following amendment: At end insert</p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;; and further requests that the Executive exempts health and  social care services from further budget reductions or requirements to deliver  any further efficiency savings.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the members of the Health Committee for tabling the  motion, which we will support if amended. With the kind support of Dawn Purvis,  the Ulster Unionist Party has proposed an amendment that seeks to add to the  motion. Although we all believe in transparency, the Ulster Unionist Party  believes that the best way to ensure that front line services are not affected  is to make health and social care services exempt from further budget  reductions, including any additional efficiency savings.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The additional sentence proposed in the amendment brings us  to the crux of the issue. Despite what some Members may believe, we cannot have  our cake and eat it. Since the beginning of this budgetary period, certain  Members and parties have held contradictory positions. On the one hand, when it  came to negotiating the draft Budget, the DUP chose to back the Finance  Minister instead of the Minister of Health. That was done despite the DUP  stating in its 2005 manifesto that Northern   Ireland has suffered from relative underfunding for  decades, and that more than 20% extra spending per capita on healthcare is  required to achieve the same levels of service as in England. Such pronouncements did  not stop the DUP, and others, from supporting a reduced budget for the Health  Minister or from voting, on two occasions, for efficiency savings. It is those  efficiency savings that are now the source of the DUP&rsquo;s concerns.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The former Chairperson of the Health Committee even went so  far as to accuse the Health Minister of being left wing, and, in more recent  times, of being in cahoots with the trade unions simply because the unions  happened to agree with the Minister. Yet again, we hear the DUP attacking the  Minister and the trust for implementing policies that the DUP supported. Does  Mrs Robinson not realise that by attacking the trade unions she is attacking  the people that work at the very heart of the Health Service?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The contradictory nature of the DUP&rsquo;s position was  epitomised by the number of Members who demanded efficiency savings two years  ago. However, in recent months, we have seen the hypocritical nature of the  DUP. The very same Members, including Mrs Robinson and her sidekick, Mr Easton,  have opposed all the efficiency saving proposals that have been put on the  table. Their pathetic behaviour smacks of hypocrisy and opportunism.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  You accused my two colleagues &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. The Member must refer all his remarks through the Chair.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  My apologies, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  The cheerleader.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  The cheerleader, as my colleague refers to him, accused my two colleagues of  opposing every proposed efficiency saving. I concur with their opposition to  the efficiencies proposed by the health trusts. Does the Member believe that  the closure of beds in Belfast  hospitals is an efficiency measure or simply the cut that it is?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I am grateful to the Member for his intervention.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member and his colleagues opposed every measure that  the Minister proposed to comply with the efficiencies that their party imposed  on the Health Service. That is the contradictory nature of their argument: they  are cheerleaders for efficiencies, yet they oppose them when tough decisions  have to be made. They opposed the Minister on the formation of the Regional  Agency for Public Health and Social Well-being, which has put us in good stead  and is at the cornerstone of what we need to do. Where is the DUP when the going  gets tough? Its opposition epitomises the hypocrisy to which I referred.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The contradiction of the DUP&rsquo;s position was highlighted on  20 April 2009 when, along with others, it refused to back an Ulster Unionist  and PUP proposal to exempt the Health Service from efficiency savings. For more  than a year, the Ulster Unionist Party has been warning that we face  significant fiscal problems in the current comprehensive spending review (CSR)  period, never mind the next one. However, successive DUP Finance Ministers have  chosen to deny that there is a problem, and then they do too little too late.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It should not be forgotten that it was a DUP Finance  Minister who proposed efficiency savings to the Executive and in the House. In  addition, DUP Members, along with others, trooped through the Lobbies to vote  for efficiency savings. After hearing what some DUP Members think constitutes  efficiency in the public purse &mdash; having purchased pens, TVs and handbags &mdash;  health workers will take no lectures from the DUP on efficiency savings.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  (DHSSPS) has had to find &pound;32 million in its budget to get a deal on funding to  address the swine flu problem. The Finance Minister shamefully joked about the  issue when the Health Minister initially appealed for funding in June.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety&rsquo;s  record, compared with that of other Ministers, speaks for itself. Would he have  been let off the hook for wasting &pound;170 million as DUP Ministers did in the  Workplace 2010 debacle? Would he have received a clear ball if he had  miscalculated the value of the Crossnacreevy site to the tune of &pound;200 million?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  No; the Member had his turn.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Would the Minister have been allowed to proceed over a  logjam, such as that in the Department of Education?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If Members are serious about protecting front line  services, they will vote for the amendment. Members need to realise that the  Health Service is already in a difficult position; demand on it has increased  by 9% in the past 12 months. If we add to that by imposing further reductions  in the Health budget to fill financial holes, lives will be put in danger. The  economy may be the number one priority in the glossy document, but ask anyone  in the street about their number one priority, and the answer is health.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is time that we all showed the required level of  maturity. I hope that Members across the House will back the amendment.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind the Member that the motion has not yet been amended. The  question on whether an amendment is agreed is one that the Assembly will decide  after the debate.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">1.30 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  We all accept that healthcare is the number one priority in Northern Ireland.  I listened to my colleague on the Committee for Health, Social Services and  Public Safety Mr McCallister rewrite history. I thank the Deputy Chairperson  for proposing the motion. I will address some related and relevant issues that  contribute to the larger picture of how the Department is managing issues.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am aware that the Minister is fairly mean with the truth  over how the Department is operating. Many of my colleagues on councils across Northern Ireland  have written to him about certain aspects of the current cuts. When he writes  back, he claims &mdash; surprise, surprise &mdash; that the problems are the bad, old DUP&rsquo;s  fault rather than his. Members will recall the Minister&rsquo;s gloating when he was  able to draw down additional moneys after the draft Budget, which was always  going to allow the Minister to make a case for more money, was signed off. On  22 January 2008, he said:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The final budget allocation is a good news story for  the health service.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">He continued:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;in light of the financial circumstances facing the  Executive, I believe it is the best outcome possible.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">On 2 February 2009, our Minister came to the House and  said:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;No cuts will be made to front-line services.&rdquo; &mdash;<span style="font-style:normal; "> [Official Report, Vol 37,  No 3, p154, col 1].</span></p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Dear, dear. Moreover, on 2 May 2008, he said:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;To start to make cuts is not what people voted us in  to do.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister did receive additional moneys. As I said, he  promised that there would be no cuts to front line staff. However, instead of  rolling up his sleeves and targeting the over-bureaucratic system that is today&rsquo;s  National Health Service, it was easier to get a chief executive, the unions,  some of his advisers and a compliant media deliberately to do his bidding by selecting  for cuts beds, nursing staff and other important provisions, such as bowel  screening. The resultant public outcry was music to the Minister&rsquo;s ears.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I understand the public&rsquo;s anxieties, but it is a disgrace  that the Minister used public concerns to cover his inept ability to use his  budget wisely. If we were to support the amendment and let the Department off  when it came to its making efficiencies, all other Departments would be  required to find 6% efficiency savings, even though the Department of Health,  Social Services and Public Safety has already been given special treatment. The  Minister is allowed to keep any efficiency savings that he makes and plough  them back into the Department.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  I will not. We listened to enough of the garbage that you spewed earlier. You  have just reminded me: I would look at your new partners &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. The Member should make all her remarks through the Chair  and not directly to the Member.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  I apologise, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Is it in order for a Member to refer to  another Member&rsquo;s words as &ldquo;garbage&rdquo;? I find it singularly inappropriate.<span class="Italic"> </span></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  Did you rise to your feet when Mr McCallister spoke?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. Thank you for that point of order, Mr O&rsquo;Loan.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I ask the Member to moderate her tone. Her earlier remarks  &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  On a point of order &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. I will take the point of order when I have finished my  explanation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Earlier, the Member spoke about meanness of truth; I ask  her to moderate her language carefully.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  As I was saying, Mr Deputy Speaker, my colleague on the Committee for Health,  Social Services and Public Safety was quick to throw out spurious comments  about expenses. For the record, that Member&rsquo;s party is associated with the  Tories, who were the worst culprits for defrauding expenses in the Westminster  Parliament. I say to the Member and his colleagues that they are happy to link  up with the Tories &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>:  Wise expenditure of taxpayers&rsquo; money is always essential, but never more so  than in the present economic downturn. It is always a challenge to prioritise  and make tough decisions, especially for the Department of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety and the Minister. However, we must have zero-based  budgeting on all programmes, all of which must be on the table and justified as  absolutely essential.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister made some snide remarks about the SDLP over  the past few months because it did not support his Department&rsquo;s exemption from  the 3% efficiency savings. I want to set the record straight on that. The SDLP  was the only party in the Assembly to vote against the Executive&rsquo;s Budget. That  was because there was no protection for front line services, no flexibility for  monitoring expenditure, no provision for unexpected emergencies such as swine  flu and no new measures to address the widening poverty gap. The SDLP called  for ring-fencing of front line services, and it stands by its reasons for doing  so. The party took a lot of criticism for that decision at the time, but it  believes that it was the right decision then and that it is still the right  decision.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In a meeting of the Committee for Health, Social Services  and Public Safety in October, one of the trade union representatives, who are  so apparently at one with the Minister, acknowledged that, in retrospect, the  SDLP was right to oppose the Budget. The SDLP cannot support one area of public  spending being exempted from efficiency savings, even if it is health and  social services, which I believe is the most important area of expenditure.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Over the past decade, public spending on health has  increased greatly above the rate of inflation. There is considerable evidence  that much of that increase has failed to considerably improve services. It has  been absorbed in higher salaries and administration, and some of it arose  because of the target-setting culture. The Minister assured us that there would  be no cuts to front line services; he also told us that he belatedly received  additional resources. He may say that he did not know about swine flu at the  time, but other Departments have had to give up some of their budgets to deal  with the swine flu emergency.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that the Minister, the Department and the new public  health body are focusing much more on prevention and early intervention. The  bowel cancer screening programme is very much about prevention and early  intervention, but it has been postponed because its budget has been taken to  deal with swine flu. Perhaps even the swine flu budget should be monitored  constantly; we need regular updates on that budget.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I worked for decades in the Health Service, and I champion  it constantly as the greatest socialist initiative ever taken by a democratic  government. I was a trade union official for most of my working life, but given  the financial crisis that we are in, no Department can be exempted from cuts.  However, no cuts should ever be made to front line services.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Although the trusts are finding it challenging, the  evidence that has been presented to the Committee for Health, Social Services  and Public Safety shows that, by and large, they are working hard to meet  efficiency savings targets. The many scare stories in the media about front  line services have damaged the confidence of the Health Service, so we should  all be serious and honourable about how we can address a downturn in the  economy and ensure that we get healthcare free at the point of need to those  who most need it.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Deeny</strong>: I  hope that the debate does not descend into party bickering. Ultimately, this  matter concerns the health of the population of Northern Ireland; and I speak as  someone who has also worked in the health service for decades. The debate is very  important. The issue is about using money efficiently to ensure that our  population is looked after to the standard that is expected in a developed  country in the modern world.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As other Members have said, survey after survey shows that  health is the most important issue to the people of Northern Ireland. A healthy  population is also a happy, fit and active population, and that has major  positive spin-offs for productivity and for the economy of Northern Ireland.  Therefore, the Minister and the Department must strive at all times to provide  the best possible modern health services for people.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Health can be divided in two parts; physical and mental. It  can also be divided into primary care, which is community care, and secondary  care, which comprises our hospitals. I, too, want to defend front line  services, by which I mean nurses, doctors and hospital beds. That is very  important, and the public must be made aware that Members are doing that. Last  week, I had a problem with a patient who could not get a hospital bed and who  was kept in an accident and emergency department overnight. That is not acceptable.  Other front line services include ambulance services and carers in the  community.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If one were to ask a member of the public whether he or she  wants fewer nurses and hospital beds or fewer directors and administrators, one  knows what the answers would be. I have been concerned about management for  some time. I know that the trusts and the Department of Health, Social Services  and Public Safety are making efforts to scale down what I have previously  called the administrative monster in our Health Service. I know that that is  happening; but is the Health Service still over-administrated when it comes to  dealing with a population of just over 1&middot;7 million people?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have said to the Health Committee that the public need to  be informed about the Health Service management structure. They do not know the  many people who manage health services. In a recent newspaper article, the  British Medical Association asked &mdash; and since then, I have also been asked &mdash;  whether there are more than 40 directors in the Belfast Trust. The public want  to know who is who and who does what in each of the trusts.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  Recently, we discovered that management costs have increased by 13% since RPA.  The number of managers has been reduced, but will the Member explain why there  has been such a huge increase in management costs, accounting for &pound;13 million?  We are meant to be doing away with waste. Could that money not be better used  for front line services?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Deeny</strong>: I  accept the Member&rsquo;s point; perhaps the Minister will answer it. We are being  told that management is being scaled down to acceptable levels. Hopefully, that  is the case.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I suggest that the people in the trusts and the Department  who provide healthcare should introduce themselves and tell the public what  they do. They should remember that they, like public representatives, are  public servants and are paid from the public purse. The public are entitled to  know who those people are.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Do I get additional time for taking an intervention, Mr  Deputy Speaker?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Yes.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Deeny</strong>: As  has been mentioned, community care is very important. For the most part, we in  healthcare and health management have often put the focus of health services on  the secondary care sector. That has to stop, because there has been a major  move towards care in the community, and rightly so. It is often thought that  community care is the cheaper option, but that is often not the case. We must  be prepared, and the Health Minister and his Department must show that they are  prepared, for this major shift in healthcare provision from the secondary  sector into the community.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As the Deputy Chairperson mentioned, financial resources  must be made available for essential community and primary care services. There  must be no delay in equipping those important services with the required  resources and personnel.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">1.45 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The proposals concern the health of the people of Northern Ireland.  I have worked in the Health Service for many years, and I believe that the  public are completely in the dark about how our Health Service is managed. The  public have a right to know the details of efficiency savings and the  contingency proposals to deal with deficits. They have a right to know whether  the savings will impact on front line services. I urge the Minister and his  Department to make the public aware of such facts.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  As much as I care about health, I hate debating health issues in the Chamber.  Regardless of the subject, the Ulster Unionist Party and the Health Minister  are always more interested in blaming everyone but themselves for the state of  the Health Service than debating the relevant issues.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Let us look at the facts. By 2010-11, the health budget  will be about &pound;4 billion. When devolution returned in 2007, it was about &pound;3&middot;5  billion. Therefore, in the space of four years, the health budget will have  increased by one eighth and will represent 48% of the entire Northern Ireland  Budget.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In its amendment, the Ulster Unionist Party requests that  the health budget be exempted from efficiency savings. However, in a way, the  Department of Health is already exempt from efficiency savings because, unlike  any other Department, it gets to keep its entire efficiency savings. To cap  that, the Department of Health gets first call on the &pound;20 million generated  from the underspend of other Departments. No other Department gets such  preferential treatment but, apparently, it is not enough. Given that our  productivity is lagging behind that of the rest of the UK, should we  not look at how to improve that situation?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Minister, we in the DUP would like to work with you.  However, when you come to a Committee meeting, you attack the DUP.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. Mr Easton, I have said it already, but I will repeat it:  you must refer all your remarks through the Chair.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  When the Health Minister comes to the Committee, we are attacked. When the  Health Minister is on TV, we are attacked. When we make helpful suggestions to  the Health Minister, we are attacked. The Health Minister is obsessed with  attacking the DUP, and it is to the detriment of our Health Service.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">When the Ambulance Service Trust came to the Committee to  discuss efficiency savings and a shortfall in its budget, we found out that it  had presented a second set of proposals to the Minister, which he had agreed to  and signed off. However, the Committee was told nothing about that, and we knew  nothing about it until reports appeared on TV and in the press. Is keeping  information from us any way to work or to build a relationship with the  Committee?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In a presentation on efficiencies by the unions, one union  member stated that trusts are playing political games with their efficiency  targets. If that is the case, what will the Health Minister do to correct it?  Does it suit his agenda? I send a clear message to the unions: you are being  conned by a Minister who is willing to play games with the Health Service and  with the people of Northern    Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We offer to meet the unions to demonstrate where &pound;78  million of savings can be found; savings that will not affect front line services  but which the Minister is ignoring. Those savings would ensure that no nursing  posts would have to go; there would be no need to remove services from  hospitals such as Mid-Ulster Hospital and Whiteabbey  Hospital; and there would be proper  ambulance cover across Northern    Ireland. As my colleague has done, I remind  the Minister that he promised the Assembly that there would be no cuts to front  line services.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister can find money when he wants to. Indeed, he  has found &pound;20 million in a so-called &ldquo;controlled fund&rdquo; to bail out the Northern  Health and Social Care Trust. We knew nothing about that money; perhaps the  Minister will tell us how much is in that wee account. As my colleague also  mentioned, the Minister has been quoted as saying that he was content with his  budget. Therefore, is the Minister saying that he has got his budget wrong? It  is strange that the Minister has never raised this as an issue at the  Executive. Surely any half-sensible Minister who was having trouble with their  budget would have done so.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I offer the Minister the chance to start again. The DUP is  willing to work with him, meet him and share his burden if he would only show a  willingness to put his bitterness behind him. The offer is unconditional, and  it has been made before. The decision to cut front line services rests with the  Minister and nobody else.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I commend the Health Committee for  tabling this motion. As the Deputy Chairperson said in her opening remarks, the  Committee tabled the motion because we felt that we were not getting the  relevant information that we needed to scrutinise the Department and the  Minister. When we do get the information, we get it either through the media or  late. That does not help. The fact is that we are there to scrutinise. We are  in a new dispensation and the Committee is there to hold people accountable for  their actions, but we are not getting the information that allows us to do  that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In saying that, I place on record my view that the Health  Service has been underfunded for years. I do not think that anybody could  disagree. Some people say that it is underfunded by &pound;100 million, others say  that the figure is &pound;600 million. Before I go into the details, I also take the  opportunity to commend the staff of the Health Service, at whatever level, for  their hard work and dedication over the years. They have faced crisis after  crisis, and they have stood up and taken on board that challenge. They are  still there and are willing to put in the hours and the work to try to deliver  front line services that are second to none.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We need to talk about the block grant. I will shy away from  getting into arguments with other parties, but the reality is that the block  grant is inadequate. We need to look at the issue of fiscal powers for this  Assembly. If we are saying that the Health Service is underfunded, we need to  look at ways of getting more money in.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I take on board the last comments that were made by the  Member who spoke previously. Like all Ministers, the Health Minister has  challenges ahead. We must ensure that there is further investment if it is  needed and that the issue of wastage in the Health Service is exposed. I have a  good working relationship with the Minister and his Department, and, fair dues,  that is how to get things done. However, I have not heard the Minister once  mention the wastage in the Health Service. I have not heard the Minister say  that efficiencies mean that we are turning the health sector into a  streamlining machine so that we can deal with all the issues that exist. We all  hear stories about taxis still being used to deliver patient records: is that a  fair way to use public money? We still hear about money that is spent on  hospitality. I submitted a question &mdash; lo and behold, I do not have the answer  today &mdash; about whether former chief executives are being held to account for  deficits in previous trusts. If the Health Service were a private company,  would it be held to account? We also need to look at the issue of travel.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If we took the time and opportunity to talk to the staff,  they could probably tell us instantly how money could be saved in front line  services and hospitals. I meet them on a regular basis and they are able to  tell me about all the money that is being wasted. The reality is that the gravy  train needs to stop. I know that the Department of Health is underfunded, but  there are inefficiencies in the Health Service. If that money were redirected  to front line care, who knows where we would be next week? We could end up  saving money.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The political argument about taking money from other  Departments cannot go anywhere. We are talking about investing for health, and  John McCallister asked where we would get the money for that. If we are serious  about it, do we take money from education? Do we take it from housing? Do we  leave the rural community abandoned? Do we not give people better roads? It is  the collective responsibility of the Executive and the individual  responsibility of other Ministers to ensure that we are investing for health.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  No; I do not have much time. It is Ministers&rsquo; responsibility to ensure that we  are proactive in dealing with health, inequalities and social deprivation,  rather than always reacting.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am conscious of my time, so I will end with a point about  the Northern Health and Social Care Trust. Fair play to the Minister for  bringing in Colm Donaghy on that contract. It was a good move; perhaps he will  move to other trusts afterwards.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Northern Trust stated:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Trust is required to make savings of &pound;44 million  to be achieved over a three-year period. These savings will be reinvested into  front line services&rdquo;.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The trust continues:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;A large part of these savings&hellip;are to be achieved  through reduced management and administrative costs and general efficiency  (such as negotiating better prices for drugs or using computer technology  instead of printing all x-ray images).&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">To me, that represents efficiency savings.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member must draw her remarks to a close.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  To me, that is doing business smarter, not harder.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  We all come to the Chamber from time to time to support our party&rsquo;s ministerial  colleagues. We do that out of some sense of loyalty and because, as party  members, we share the same policy. However, the amendment tabled in the names  of Mr McCallister, Mr Gardiner and Dawn &ldquo;One Job&rdquo; Purvis, who, unfortunately,  does not seem to be here today, goes well above and beyond the call of duty in  showing loyalty to one&rsquo;s ministerial colleague.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to dwell on the amendment. To call for the Health  Service to be exempted from efficiency savings that are the harsh reality that  everybody in every Department faces is ridiculous. To say that the money for a  Health Service that has been force-fed resources for nigh-on a decade has and  is being efficiently spent is, in my opinion, wrong. As Mrs Hanna pointed out,  the increase in expenditure in the Health Service is now at record levels. Billions  upon billions upon billions of pounds are being pumped into the Health Service  every year. To say that there is no scope for efficiency in that system is the  height of nonsense.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A raft of indicators shows that there is scope for savings,  even on administration, never mind productivity and on how things are done in  the Health Service. One looks at &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  No. In a decade, the number of Health Service administrators has risen by 35%,  the number of managers is up 91%, and the number of senior managers is up by  82%. Mr Easton pointed out that there has been a 13% increase in management  costs post-RPA, which was supposed to drive efficiency in Health Service  administration.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As have others, I have asked Assembly questions of the  Minister as part of my work to establish where efficiencies might be achieved.  I have asked about equality units, press and communications and a host of back  office, non-front line areas of administration. Time and time again I have received  the same response, which is none, other than that the details are not held  centrally.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">For example, because I wanted to know about the subject in  general, I asked every Department about the cost of advertising in local  newspapers. Every Department was able to answer that question, except the  Minister&rsquo;s. I got no answer at all. Every Department except the Department of  Health answered the question.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  I, like the Member, am not getting answers. Does he agree that not getting  replies to questions for written answer is a deliberate attempt to prevent us  from knowing what is going on in the Health Service?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I began to worry whether it was just me, Mr Deputy Speaker, but then I started  to do some research, and I found that not only Mr Easton, Mrs Iris Robinson &mdash; I  thought that perhaps it was just my party &mdash; but Members of every party have  failed to receive answers from the Minister.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Only two conclusions are possible: either the Minister  knows and is not telling us, which is worrying for the integrity of the House,  or he genuinely does not know, which is even more worrying. If the latter is  the case, the Health Minister is telling us that he cannot explain where the  money granted to him in the Budget is being spent. That is deeply, deeply, deeply  worrying.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  Does the Member agree that it is about time that we got the performance and  efficiency delivery unit (PEDU) to look at the Minister&rsquo;s budget and direct him  on efficiencies?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  If the Minister or those working for him cannot get their heads around  efficiencies, others are capable of helping him to do it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">However, if the Minister has no idea of where his money is  being spent, that means that he has no control over where it is being spent,  yet he wants to be exempt from efficiency savings. If anything, not being in  control of his budget is an argument for greater scrutiny. It does not matter  whether that is carried out by his officials or by bodies outside his  Department, such as PEDU; there is a case for greater, not less, scrutiny.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Earlier, Mrs Robinson asked about the implications other  budgets of exempting the Department of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety. The implication is that the efficiency savings that would have to be  made in other front line services, such as education and housing, would  increase. Therefore, when Members look for ring-fencing and separation and for  no further efficiency savings in health, they are asking for increased  efficiencies &mdash; ergo, cuts &mdash; in other areas. I am sick, sore and tried, as I  think many Members are, of that emotional game being played with us and, more  importantly, with the public and those who work in the Health Service. Nobody  in their right mind in this country believes that the Health Service is as  efficient or as productive as it could be. Therefore, driving greater  efficiency into the service is not only desirable but absolutely essential.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McGimpsey can sit and cry about the efficiency savings  that he faces, and his colleagues can back him up, but the fact is that he  agreed to those efficiencies when he voted for them in the Budget, and the  cheerleaders who sit behind him also agreed to them when they trooped through  the Lobby. They supported a Budget that was predicated on his achieving the  efficiencies that he now faces. I know that the Minister faces a difficult job  in dealing with the Health Service.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member should draw his remarks to a close.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  The Health Service has a leviathan 50% of the Budget, but many of us are of the  opinion that it is a difficult job that the Minister is not up to.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  The pressure of achieving efficiency savings is nowhere more apparent than in  the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety. The Minister  stated that &pound;700 million of efficiency savings are demanded, when years of  underinvestment mean that our services are not as good as those in the rest of  the UK.  He is quite right that objective measures show that productivity in the Health  Service in Northern Ireland  is well below that in the most efficient parts of Britain, and that presents a major  challenge to his Department. It also puts a question mark over the reference to  underinvestment in the past; I will come to that point later.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Health is an ever-demanding funding area. New technologies  and drugs come on stream all the time, and medical conditions that the public  previously thought had to be accepted now demand a remedy. The Minister tells  us that the demand for services is rising by 9% each year. That is a remarkable  figure, so I hope that he will give us more details about it. In an arena in which  funding is flat and 3% year-on-year efficiencies are required, a 9% annual rise  in demand puts an almost unsustainable burden on the system.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I return to the issue of underinvestment in the past. I  wonder whether the key lesson is not that opportunities to address the problems  in a more deep-seated way have been ignored but that we have tried to nurse the  system along when more surgery was required. Surely that needs to change,  particularly given that we will soon face real and substantial cuts in the  overall Budget.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Some discussions about efficiency savings make a rigid  distinction between front line services and administration. The argument is  that efficiency savings should come from the administration side and that front  line services should be protected. That argument is overly simplistic, and I am  disappointed to discover that Dr Deeny seems to live in that world. Front line  services and administration are intimately bound up, and the idea that there is  some easy way to achieve efficiencies in administration without impacting on  front line services is false.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Recently, the pressure on the health and social care trusts  to provide efficiency savings has become evident. Efficiency savings do not  take money away from the trusts, but they are required to fund new areas of  work from money that has been moved around internally. Quite simply, that  cannot be done, and I have much sympathy for the Minister when he says that all  this is happening too fast. I wonder whether trusts will be forced into  so-called efficiencies that, in the long run, will not contribute usefully to  real efficiencies and may get in the way of better long-term solutions.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In recent weeks, it has become clear that, in several  cases, trusts are not able to deliver the efficiency savings that their targets  require and also balance their budgets. Trusts&rsquo; total projected overspend is  reported as being approximately &pound;70 million. Therefore, to break even, they  were going to have to make savage cuts to front line services. The situation  has been addressed through the Department&rsquo;s providing extra funding to the  trusts, but that comes at a cost.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It means that key initiatives will, at the very least, be  postponed, and, in the present climate, who knows when they will be resumed?  That brings me to the Northern Health Trust, which includes my constituency.  Its projected overspend for this year was &pound;28&middot;5 million; its chief executive  said so at the Health Committee last week. That has now been addressed by the  trust&rsquo;s doubling its own efficiency savings to &pound;7 million and the Department  providing the balance, with a contribution to the pension scheme. I note that  the Minister has now largely approved the initial efficiency savings plan of the  trust, which includes moving acute inpatient surgery from the Whiteabbey and  Mid-Ulster hospitals to the Antrim and Causeway hospitals. I note also that  there will be more day surgery at Whiteabbey and Mid-Ulster.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way. He will agree that front line services are  very important: he has outlined that already. Will he also agree that each year  some &pound;30 million may be saved in travel expenses and that that could be used to  ensure that front line services are retained while making efficiency savings?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  leave the Member&rsquo;s comment as he has expressed it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Two residential homes in the Northern Health Trust will be  replaced, including Rathmoyle Home in Ballycastle. I am most enthusiastic and  optimistic about this scheme, as it could provide a better standard of care for  elderly people and others who need support, whether in the community or in  residential accommodation. I welcome the work already undertaken by trust staff  in the analysis of local needs.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Taken as a whole, the changes proposed by the trust will  enhance services in the trust area. I note that the proposals that have been  adopted are almost the same as those proposed by the trust under its former  chief executive, who recently retired. I hope that the Minister will  acknowledge that and agree with me that the primary cause of overspend relates  to deep-seated structural features that have not been addressed historically.  That is the key to the future, when there will be a much tighter funding  environment. To call for the Health Service to be insulated from those  pressures merely dodges the issue.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member draw his remarks to a close?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: Perhaps  that tight funding environment will give the spur to the real changes that lead  to a financially sustainable and better Health Service. I hope that the  Minister will lead the way.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: I have scribbled  down some of the points that Members made, and I will try to respond to them.  Some merit response, not least Simon Hamilton&rsquo;s allegation that the number of  managers has risen. That is not true; the number of managers has declined. He said  that the cost of managers has risen; that is not true either. He said that the  size of management has risen; that is not true. In fact, the size of the  administration and management has been reduced: from 19 trusts to six and from  four boards to one. I have reduced the number of senior executives from 180 to  about 60. That pattern is repeated all the way down the line.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have to say to Members &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I will not give way to Simon  Hamilton at present because I want to &mdash; <em>[Interruption.]</em></p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Deputy Speaker, it is difficult for me to respond if Mr  Hamilton keeps talking at me from a sedentary position; he should have the  manners to listen. I had the manners to listen to him and to all his  colleagues.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>[Interruption.]</em></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: With respect to Simon Hamilton&rsquo;s  remark that the Health Service has been &ldquo;force-fed money&rdquo;, I ask you whether he  is the sort of colleague with whom you can go into the Lobbies. He spoke of</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;billions upon  billions upon billions of pounds&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">being force-fed into the Health Service.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. Minister, all remarks must be addressed through me.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I beg your pardon, Mr Deputy  Speaker.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Hamilton complains that he does not receive answers to  his questions. My Department answers more questions than any other.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  Not to this party.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Health,  Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: If I may be allowed to answer: the  Member who receives most answers is Alex Easton, who received more than 500  answers. Do Members know how much it costs to answer each of his questions?  Three hundred pounds. I have spent about &pound;150,000 answering Alex Easton&rsquo;s  questions. Answering other Members&rsquo; questions has cost similar sums. I have  answered hundreds and hundreds of questions. Simon Hamilton has asked me  questions about flowers; that is the sort of question that I am often asked. As  well as intelligent questions, I am often asked trivial ones. One of Alex  Easton&rsquo;s latest questions &mdash; since he complains about questions &mdash; is whether  there will be a Christmas party in Ravarra House. This is purely party  political, and we have only to listen to Mrs Robinson talking from a sedentary  position to understand that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am being asked to respond to a debate on efficiency  savings and their impact on health services. Let me begin by reminding Members  of the debate in April on the loss of nursing posts. The House debated an  amendment that asked for the Health Department to be exempt from efficiency  savings. Only the UUP and the PUP supported that amendment. Everyone else in  the Assembly voted against the amendment and for these efficiencies. Yet  Members criticise me when they see the efficiencies being put on the table.  That debate was, in fact, scheduled after every single trust, including the  Ambulance Service Trust, had put their efficiency plans on the table.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Everyone in this House who voted against that amendment  knew exactly what they were voting for, because the efficiency plans had been  published and consulted upon. There had been discussions with the Health  Committee and debates. Therefore, everyone knew exactly what they were voting  for, and they voted against exemption for Health. They can do it in Scotland, but  they cannot do it here, so you tell me what is going on.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Today, Members have an opportunity to look at that matter  again. There is no question that health and social care trusts should be  efficient, and there is no doubt that we are achieving exactly that. However,  let me again remind Members about some of the difficulties that we face: there  is the matter of a massive &pound;600 million funding gap between Northern Ireland and England. For us to have the same  Health Service here as they have in England, we need another &pound;600 million.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Our local health and social care services are simply not as  good as those in the rest of the UK, and it does not matter how efficient we  make ourselves &mdash; we keep becoming more and more efficient &mdash; because we will  always be &pound;600 million behind. That gap cannot be closed by efficiencies alone.  That means that our services will never be as good as those in England. In  fact, the DUP, once upon a time, in its 2005 manifesto, said that a 20%  increase in healthcare funding was required. That is another broken manifesto  promise.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion asks for details of trusts&rsquo; efficiency savings  and contingency plans. The details of all those were widely publicised. The  proposals were subject to full public consultation. Members might also remember  that there was major disquiet about proposals to find the efficiencies, in  stark contrast to the eerie silence that met proposals by other Departments.  Why was that? Is it because health and social care is so important? Of course  it is. No other Department or Minister is in the same situation, but then all  other Departments are more generously funded vis-&agrave;-vis their budgets.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, the concerns of individual Assembly Members  and of the general public have not been reflected in the funds voted by the  Assembly to health and social care. I said, at the time of the Budget, that it  was not enough, but that it was as good as it gets. I said that the increase  that I got over the draft Budget was good news, but I was looking for a lot  more than I got. Therefore, let me start by &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: No, I will not give way, Mrs  Robinson. You have managed to do enough talking from a sedentary position.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Let me start by explaining the challenges that we face.  First, demand for health services is increasing at an unprecedented rate of 9%.  Mr O&rsquo;Loan wanted details: there are about 48,000 more first outpatient  appointments; approximately 13,000 more inpatient procedures; and some 14,000  extra A&amp;E attendances. That gives some idea of the extras. Demand for  hospital services is, therefore, rising by around 9%.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In contrast, the DUP, or some Members, talked about the  record rise in Health spending. Our growth this year is one half of a  percentage point: 0&middot;5% above inflation. John Appleby, who was much quoted and  who conducted a review of health and social care provision in Northern Ireland,  said that Health in Northern Ireland should get 4&middot;3% above inflation. This year  we are getting half of one per cent and dealing with a 9% increase in demand.  You do not have to be a mathematician to work all that out.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Funding growth in England  and Wales  runs at 3&middot;7%; we are well behind that. Does the Assembly want a return to  unacceptably long waiting times?</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Members talk about productivity. Michelle O&rsquo;Neill and Simon  Hamilton attacked the productivity of the Health Service in Northern Ireland,  and I was surprised to hear Sue Ramsey echoing those attacks. The productivity  of the Health Service in Northern    Ireland is rising, and that is a measure of  how good its staff are. It is hard to be absolutely efficient and totally  productive in some of the facilities where the staff are working, with some of  the equipment that they are working with and in view of the years of historic  underfunding. However, Members have seen massive improvements in such areas as  waiting times and the availability to MS and arthritis sufferers of  life-changing drugs. Those are the sorts of things on which we will be looking  to compromise if we continue along the road that we are on.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is also a need for investment in older people&rsquo;s  services, for example. The number of people over 75 is rising by almost 3% a  year. Mr O&rsquo;Loan wanted to know where that increase is coming from. Within that  group, the number of over-85s in our community is increasing by almost 4% each  year, and that will bring serious financial pressures. If living longer is to  be achieved with dignity, we must provide for the additional services that  people need. The cost of healthcare for people who are over 75 more than  quadruples, and the cost for people aged over 85 increases by more than 10 times.  Does the Assembly want to care for older people? I know how the people of Northern Ireland  and I will answer that question. Our priority is to care for every man, woman  and child, irrespective of their age.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Further evidence of the difficulty that we face in trying  to meet the rising demand was highlighted in the trusts&rsquo; contingency plans.  There seems to be a misunderstanding about that as well. The trusts attend  Committee meetings and explain their efficiency plans. In April, the efficiency  plans are consulted on, debated and voted on; they are there for all to see.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: No. Within my budget, unlike  certain Members &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. The Minister has accused the House of having  voted for efficiency plans. The record will show that the House has never voted  for efficiency plans.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Mr Hamilton will know that that is not a point of order.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The trusts explained their  efficiency plans, so everyone knew what they were voting for. With regard to  contingency plans, I had within my budget settlement an agreement that I would  bid for pandemic flu in those terms &mdash; and I say that for the benefit of Mr  Hamilton, who clearly has not read my budget agreement. I bid for pandemic flu,  and, in June, I could not persuade the Executive to discuss it with me.  Therefore, I had to set aside funding as the Department&rsquo;s contingency to  provide for the possibility of not getting money for pandemic flu.  Alternatively, I could simply have cancelled the vaccines, antivirals and extra  paediatric critical care cots that I had on order, but I did not do that; I  went ahead with those provisions. There are accountancy rules, and, by the way,  Mrs O&rsquo;Neill, you cannot have a 0&middot;5% leeway.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. All remarks are to be made through the Chair.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I beg your pardon, Mr Deputy  Speaker. Mrs O&rsquo;Neill made a point about a 0&middot;5% leeway, but all trusts have to  balance their books.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It was only at the end of September, when I finally got  agreement from the Executive to fund swine flu to the tune of 50%, that I was  able to release half of that money from the contingency. That allowed me to  take some of the sting out of the contingency plans. It did not allow me to  take out all of the sting; there is still an issue there, and I am still  grappling with it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have said that we will make the efficiencies, and we are  making them. I have also said that I will maintain the front line services, and  we have done that. In fact, the front line is 7% more productive, which I know  will interest Members who have attacked our Health Service staff for not being  as productive as those in other parts of the UK. We have done extra business,  and we have coped. We cannot cope with an extra if that means making more cuts  and paying half the swine flu bill and then being expected to start the process  again. We must bear in mind that the Department receives &pound;600 million less in  funding than its counterpart in England  and that it must also find &pound;700 million of efficiency savings and &pound;32 million  for swine flu. We must also bear in mind that, of the first &pound;20 million that  the Department was to receive each year from the Budget, it must fund &pound;10  million itself to get a financial settlement. That is why the constant &mdash; <em>[Interruption.]</em></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I  have said almost all that I need to say. Members are well aware of the  situation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">All the arguments and the political point scoring in the  world will not alter the fact that the Health Service is not funded properly by  the Assembly and that it receives 43% of the block grant, not 50%, as some  Members claimed. That money is available, and I must make that argument on  behalf of the Health Service and the staff who man it. They do a tremendous job  for the population in Northern    Ireland. I will continue to make that  argument, and I will not apologise for doing so.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As a result of the efficiency cuts that the Department must  make, we will reach a point where required front line services cannot be  maintained. The cuts that are being proposed and those that I have absorbed  already add up to the fact that we could be facing reductions, the possibility  of closures and the need to reduce costs further. There is no other way to deal  with the situation, and, effectively, we will be going from having a  cradle-to-grave Health Service that is free at the point of delivery to being  in a situation in which there are attempts to ration healthcare provision. Such  rationing has occurred in the past; when money ran out, waiting lists rose and  new drugs, treatments and technologies were not provided. When the Health  Service runs out of money, investment must be prioritised. None of us wants to  get to that position, and I know that this is more important &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Minister please draw his remarks to a close?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I will do exactly that, Mr  Deputy Speaker.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Constantly repeating political mantras does not alter the  facts. There have been no cuts to front line services, and the Health Service  is doing more business now than ever before; however, that situation cannot  continue.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Minister&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  In making my winding-up speech on the amendment, I want to reflect on some of  the remarks that other Members made.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mrs O&rsquo;Neill opened the debate by reflecting on some of the  management and administration costs of the Health Service. However, when the  trusts gave their evidence to the Committee for Health, Social Services and  Public Safety, there was surprise among Committee members that the  administration and management costs of all the trusts were actually only 3% to  4% of their total budget. That is an incredible position to be in.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will also highlight some of Mrs Robinson&rsquo;s comments so  that the House can decide for itself what has changed her mind over the years.  She spent most of her contribution talking about the good Budget outcome.  However, despite her opposition to any more resources being granted to the  health budget, she supported and campaigned hard for the initial draft Budget  and objected to the additional funding that the Minister secured. The Minister  answered her point on several occasions when he said that that was the best outcome  in the circumstances.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Unfortunately, the debate has once again descended into a discussion between  two parties about personalities.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In my remarks, I accepted that the Health Service is  underfunded, and I do not think that anyone in the Chamber would deny that. I  specifically asked the Minister to speak about wastage in the Health Service.  If the Member does not believe that there have been efficiency savings or that  money has not been wasted, why has the Northern Trust said that it will save  &pound;19 million by reducing administration?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I was coming to the Member&rsquo;s remarks on wastage &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Yes, I will.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: All the trusts and the  Department are saving money on administration. I went through some of the steps  that we have taken and will continue to take. We aim to be as efficient as  possible, but all the efficiency measures that we take will not change the fact  that our health budget is &pound;600 million behind that of England. That  will not change, and we are getting further behind. If we want a Health Service  that is comparable to that of England,  that requires investment. To say that we are not making enough efficiency  savings does not alter the fact that we do not have enough headline money.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I thought that Ms Ramsey went a little far when she started to use phrases such  as &ldquo;gravy train&rdquo;. Unlike you, Mrs Robinson, I actually believe &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order, order. The Member must make all his remarks through the  Chair.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I apologise.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mrs Hanna spoke about ring-fencing front line services, and  she said that we need to improve services. I support her call for prevention,  early detection and early intervention, which would be a huge benefit in many  areas. That is the direction in which we are travelling.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Hamilton spoke rather harshly about the Health Service  being force-fed money. I remind him that the DUP, in its 2005 manifesto, called  for 20% extra funding for health. That was the platform on which Mrs Robinson  was elected. What has changed her mind? It did not take her long to break that  promise. <em>[Interruption.] </em>At that time, she also spoke about 9% extra  funding being insufficient. She now supports and champions a 0&middot;5% growth in  funding. Is that an admission that she was wrong in 2005 and that she is right  now? What is she actually talking about? Does she even know? <em>[Interruption.]</em></p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As the Minister said, demands on the Health Service are  rising more rapidly than the requirement for services in any other Department.  Health Service inflation is higher, and yet, as the Minister outlined, the  growth in real terms is 0&middot;5 %, and we are falling further and further behind  our fellow countrymen in England.  Some Members seem oblivious to the idea that that will have a knock-on effect.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Members cannot keep bringing motions to the Assembly  demanding that the Department commits more resources or takes more action in  this area and then wonder why it cannot be achieved. They cannot have their  cake and eat it. <em>[Interruption.] </em>If Mrs Robinson wants to make an  intervention, why does she not just ask for one?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I have no more time. If Mrs Robinson had asked me two minutes ago, I would have  been happy to give way.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:  The Member must draw his remarks to a close.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  DUP Members must remember that they cannot have their cake and eat it. At least  I am willing to engage in debate, unlike the Member.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. As Question Time commences at 2.30 pm, I suggest that the  House takes its ease until that time. The debate will continue after Question  Time, when the next Member to speak will be Mrs Michelle O&rsquo;Neill.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The debate stood suspended.</p>

      <p class="H3SectionHeading">Office Of The First Minister And Deputy First  Minister</p>
      <p class="H4StageHeading">Cross-sector Advisory Forum</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mr  Cobain </strong>asked the First Minister and deputy First Minister to provide an  update on any recommend&shy;ations, actions or implementation plans emerging from  the cross-sector advisory forum meeting in October 2009.&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 318/10<a name="AQO31810"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister (Mr M McGuinness)</strong>: The cross-sector advisory forum met in the Long  Gallery on 7 October. That was the third plenary session since April. Over the  summer, the forum&rsquo;s subgroups worked on a substantial range of issues aimed at  generating ideas for mitigating the problems arising from the economic crisis.  An update of the work of each subgroup was given to the forum, and we asked  each group to submit a recommendations paper to us. We plan to review and  evaluate those, and we intend to produce a consolidated report for the next  meeting.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The meeting of 7 October also included useful sessions  about what we are doing to help people who have recently lost their jobs and  how we can best help people who are unemployed to get into work. We also heard  from local government representatives about what that sector is doing to  support local businesses and people through the crisis. We continue to pay  close attention to the impact of the recession on the local economy, and that  continues to be a standing item on the agenda of Executive meetings.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The work of the forum is a key element in our response, and  it provides us with an opportunity to gather further ideas on our best approach  to dealing with the local impacts of the recession and, ultimately, resolving  the crisis.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cobain</strong>:  Does the deputy First Minister think that we will get any recommendations from  that group before the end of the recession?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: I certainly hope that over the course of the next short while,  the group will come forward with recommendations. We have charged it with the  responsibility to do that, and the subgroups worked over the summer to draw up  recommendations in each of their respective areas to address the downturn.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Six subgroups have been established. The infra&shy;structure  group is looking at the out-turn of the capital spend of &pound;1&middot;7 billion. It is  also looking at future capital work opportunities, which are now posted on the  Strategic Investment Board (SIB) information portal to allow the construction  industry to better plan business. It is also looking at planning reform, which  is out for public consultation and includes proposals for reforms of the  pre-consultation planning process, whereby applicants can talk to officials  before submitting their plans, thus avoiding obvious impediments and, ultimately,  shortening the planning process.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The business and skills group is considering three areas:  economic regeneration, exports and manufacturing. There is a list of  recommendations, including maintaining support for construction, improving  awareness of export support schemes and improving awareness of government  business support schemes.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The group on hardship, poverty, debt and energy is dealing  with access to prepayment meters, awareness of the &ldquo;green new deal&rdquo;, bulk fuel  purchase, gas boiler conversion, extension of the gas network, domestic  renewables, awareness of benefits, financial advice for consumers, and so on.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The agriculture group is dealing with such issues as the  opportunities for renewable energy, how the demand side of the equation could  be stimulated and how public procurement might be deployed in that regard.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The banking and finance group is looking at how the  national asset management agency will operate. That is a core issue for the  group. It has also considered how lending to business could be improved, and it  has considered options to support the housing market and mortgage holders.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The housing group is considering how to stabilise house  prices, including assessing the downside of too much government intervention,  which can push up prices, and other proposals.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that, in the next short while, we will receive the  groups&rsquo; proposals. They will be brought together in a paper that we will make  available to Members.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I thank the deputy First Minister for that detailed response. In an earlier  response, he mentioned local government. What help and assistance can he give  local government, other than the streamlining of planning applications? It must  be more than that. What advice has local government been given? What resources  have been set aside to assist local government? How does OFMDFM intend to ask  local government to help the economy and the people who come here looking for  jobs?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: The issue is not the advice that we have given local government.  Obviously, we seek to hear the views of different interest groups that we meet  on how we should go forward with regard to their particular responsibilities.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In one of our meetings, a NILGA (Northern Ireland Local  Government Association) representative gave us a detailed report on the work in  which the association is engaged. I will not go into the detail of that because  it would take too long. We await with considerable interest groups&rsquo; suggestions  on how to take our business forward and on how we can help them.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. T&aacute; ceist agam don LeasCh&eacute;ad Aire. An  dtig leis an LeasCh&eacute;ad Aire m&iacute;ni&uacute; d&uacute;inn cad &eacute; at&aacute; d&eacute;anta ag an Choiste  Feidhmi&uacute;ch&aacute;in agus ag a Oifig f&eacute;in le d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis an mheathl&uacute; geilleagair  agus leis na fadhbanna eacnama&iacute;ocha at&aacute; againn?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the deputy First Minister for outlining what the  Executive and OFMDFM are doing to address the economic downturn. I ask the  First Minister &mdash; sorry, deputy First Minister &mdash; <em>[Interruption.] &mdash; </em>has  OFMDFM been able to communicate that effectively to wider society?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: Go raibh maith agat as an cheist sin.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Following the global financial crisis, which took hold in  September 2008, Invest NI has seen growing uncertainty in the market. Companies  increasingly focus on cost containment, indicating that they are deferring  investment decisions and reviewing business strategies. As a result, the  pipeline of new foreign direct investment prospects is not as strong as it was  in 2008. Recently, however, there have been indications of an upturn in  interest. Invest NI has seen an increase in inward business activity.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There have also been several significant investment  announcements recently. Just a few weeks ago, the First Minister and I were  particularly pleased to welcome the top management team of the New York Stock  Exchange to Belfast to announce one of the  biggest US investments in  Europe this year, with a planned opening of a new state-of-the-art development  facility in Belfast  next year. That will result in the creation of up to 400 new technical,  operational and corporate jobs, including 75 positions from a prior agreement.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">No one should doubt the scale and significance of that  announcement, which is a major endorsement of local talent, knowledge and  infrastructure. When such a high-profile institution decides to invest here, it  sends out a clear message to other potential investors. Over the past two  years, I, along with the First Minister and his predecessor, Ian Paisley, have  had ongoing engagement with staff at the highest level in the stock exchange,  which, to our delight, led to that announcement.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In March 2009, the First Minister and I went to Los Angeles to meet  representatives of Universal Pictures and HBO. Universal Pictures has since  completed a film at the Paint Hall in Belfast,  and HBO has now moved in. That has created hundreds of new jobs for people in  the joinery trade and the creative arts.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Members will also be aware that the US Admin&shy;istration  appointed Declan Kelly as economic envoy in September 2009. Mr Kelly has been  relentless in his task. We are delighted that our close relationship with the  US Administration resulted in that high-profile and productive appointment.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">Victims</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr  Bresland </strong>asked the First Minister and deputy First Minister to outline the  provision made for victims to date and when the proposed new victims&rsquo; service  will be operational.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 319/10<a name="AQO31910"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: Funding of &pound;36 million has been allocated to support work with  victims and survivors during the three years from 2008 to 2011. There is &pound;12&middot;5  million for the current financial year, which is an increase of approximately  &pound;4&middot;5 million on last year&rsquo;s allocation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Victims&rsquo; groups continue to receive funding through  development grants, core funding and interim capacity funds. Individuals  continue to receive support from the memorial fund.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The establishment of the Commission for Victims and  Survivors and the victims&rsquo; forum has given a new focus to that work. We will  publish a new victims and survivors&rsquo; strategy, which is intended to outline how  we envisage work in that area progressing over the next 10 years.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Recently, public consultation was completed on proposals  for a new victims and survivors&rsquo; service. We received detailed responses to our  proposals from the sector. I can give the assurance that, as we work through  the process of analysing those responses and agreeing how to move forward,  there will be no shortfall in provision during the transition to the proposed  new arrangements.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bresland</strong>:  Will the deputy First Minister assure victims that there will be no shortfall  during the transition?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: Yes, I can provide people with that assurance. The evidence that  there will be no such shortfall is the allocation of an extra &pound;4&middot;5 million this  year, which is a substantial financial increase.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I am grateful for the deputy First Minister&rsquo;s initial response. Given that the  consultation period on the proposals for the service ended on 17 October 2009,  will he detail any major themes to emerge from that process? Will he also  outline the terms of any early representations made by the Victims&rsquo;  Commissioners on that important matter?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: It would be wrong of me to make public any themes in advance of  the situation being moved forward in the way that I outlined. Although the  closing date for the consultation was 16 October 2009, OFMDFM is still  accepting responses from some of the key stakeholders in the sector, including  the forum. It remains our intention to establish a new service as soon as  possible. We are considering the consultation responses, and those will help to  inform the next steps, including what form that new service will take.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We will discuss the final proposals for the service with  the Committee for the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister,  of which the Member is the Chairperson. I assure the Member that victims and  survivors will not be disadvantaged while we put the new arrangements in place,  as appropriate transitional funding arrangements will be established.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: I  thank the deputy First Minister for his answers thus far. One of my main  concerns about the victims&rsquo; service, as it is outlined in the consultation,  centres on the relationships between the service, the commission, OFMDFM and  the forum. Before a new victims&rsquo; service is established, will it be possible to  overcome the apparent confusion that exists, even in the consultation document,  about lines of reporting and different areas of authority?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: As we have moved along the process, we have all been learning  from the new challenges. It is clear from the publication of OFMDFM&rsquo;s strategy,  the work on putting in place a new service and the ongoing dialogue with the  Committee for the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister that  we all recognise the importance of ensuring a seamless transition. It is  important to have a joined-up approach, and OFMDFM will endeavour to work with  all the interested groups that the Member mentioned.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">Executive Confidentiality</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Mr  Savage </strong>asked the First Minister and deputy First Minister what is the  definition of &lsquo;Executive confidentiality&rsquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  320/10<a name="AQO32010"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: We are committed to openness and transparency and to facilitating  questions and freedom of information requests as far as practicable. However,  it is essential that the Executive be allowed to conduct their work in an  environment in which individual Ministers can be confident that the content of  their papers and their views are protected. Therefore, at their meeting on 13  September 2007, the Executive unanimously agreed a protocol on confidentiality.  The purpose of that protocol is to establish a number of principles to which  Ministers should adhere. The principles apply to the handling of information  that they obtain as members of the Executive and to making public statements on  any matter that has been, or may be, the subject of Executive consideration.  For that reason, we do not normally release information concerning details of Executive  business, although we may, on occasion, consider it appropriate to provide  information on the Executive&rsquo;s work on a particular issue.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We hope that the Assembly will acknowledge and understand  our position. We note, however, that the Member has requested a range of  historical information on Executive business under the Freedom of Information  Act, and his request is now being considered.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>:  Is it not a curious position that, under Executive confidentiality, the deputy  First Minister withholds information that will become public through  implementation anyway? What is the deputy First Minister hiding, and why is he  hiding it? Will he confirm that items on the agenda will become public  information when the date for a meeting is agreed?</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: The confidentiality protocol covers the detail and content of  Executive papers, minutes, records, discussions and deliberations. It protects  the space for expression of views while facilitating the reaching of an agreed  position. The confidentially protocol exists only to ensure that the  appropriate conditions prevail whereby all opinions and viewpoints can be  freely voiced and considered in the formulation of a final Executive position.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In reference to the Member&rsquo;s last comment, it is important  to remember that the work of the Executive, be that consultation documents,  Bills or new policies, emerge into public view through the relevant  Departments.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The fact that Ministers, including the two Ministers from  the Member&rsquo;s party, unanimously supported the protocol at the meeting in  September 2007 is a very clear indication that people understand the value of  Executive business being confidential.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Butler</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. The deputy First Minister answered the  question by clarifying the need for the confidentiality protocol. He also  pointed out that the two Ulster Unionist Ministers agreed to that protocol  during the meeting at which it was discussed.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">Presbyterian Mutual Society</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mr  Elliott </strong>asked the First Minister and deputy First Minister to outline any  discussions they have had with the Prime Minister and the Chancellor regarding  the possible format of a solution for savers with the Presbyterian Mutual  Society.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 321/10<a name="AQO32110"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: The First Minister and I are taking a very active and close  interest in the ongoing work to find a solution to the difficulties of the  Presbyterian Mutual Society (PMS). We know that the matter is of great concern  to members of the PMS and the wider community. The frequency with which we are  asked by Members to provide updates on the working group that is addressing the  matter demonstrates the widespread support that the work to find a solution  enjoys and, indeed, deserves.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We are happy to take questions, not only to provide what  information we can but to take the opportunity to assure Members that the  matter continues to receive very close attention. In answering questions for  oral answer on 19 October, the First Minister outlined the range of discussions  about the PMS that we had with the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Liam Byrne,  on 14 October. We are still awaiting the full report on final considerations  and options, but we expect that to emerge in the near future.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Members will know that the financial and commercial  sensitivities surrounding the matter are such that we need to preserve a  certain level of confidentiality about the options until a viable resolution  has been identified and agreed. We assure Members, however, that we are working  to secure the best outcome for PMS savers.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  Unlike others, I have no vested interest, large or small, in the PMS. There has  been public speculation about the possibility of a local bank being involved in  rescuing the society. Will the deputy First Minister comment on the form that  such involvement may take?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: One of the options being explored involves the participation of a  financial institution in a funding package. The Member will appreciate that the  matter is complex and that, therefore, there is a number of challenging issues  to deal with. It is vital that we ensure that any British Government backing  for such a package does not breach EU state aid rules. However, I do not want  to go into detail about the options under consideration because that might  adversely prejudice or jeopardise the outcome that we hope will flow from them.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We hope that any solution for assisting the PMS will follow  the precedents already set by interventions in other cases, including Bradford  &amp; Bingley, Dunfermline Building Society, and Equitable Life.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I take the Minister&rsquo;s advice that  there are sensitivities and confidentialities involved. However, can he confirm  whether the Financial Services Authority (FSA) was critical of some aspects of  the management of the Presbyterian Mutual Society?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: The Financial Services Authority confirmed that it investigated  the activities of the PMS to consider whether it was conducting regulated  activities without the necessary authorisation or exemption. The FSA concluded  its investigation and decided that the PMS was conducting regulated activities  without the necessary authorisation or exemption. However, on the basis of the  information available, and, applying the criteria in the code for crown  prosecutors, the FSA decided that it would not be right to take a case against  those involved in running the PMS. However, the FSA remains in touch with the  administrator, and, if further information comes to light relating to the  issues investigated, it will look into it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The important point to remember is that many ordinary  Presbyterians have invested their savings in the PMS. When we discussed the  matter with Prime Minister Gordon Brown, he accepted the argument that there is  a moral responsibility to resolve the dilemma that those people are in. All of  us, who understand the difficulty and pain that ordinary savers are going  through, fully understand the need to expedite this in a way that will see  those people get their money back.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I do not have an interest in the  subject, but many of my constituents do. Does the deputy First Minister agree  that if the collapse had happened in Gordon Brown&rsquo;s constituency, or anywhere  across the water, there might have been more urgency in seeking a successful  conclusion to the problem?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: That was one of the points that we made.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I warmly welcome the deputy First Minister&rsquo;s answer, and the answer given by  the First Minister on 19 October.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Do both Ministers appreciate the deep anxiety that there is  among savers and the urgent need for a comprehensive resolution to the problem?  People are deeply worried and sick as a result of the collapse of the  Presbyterian Mutual Society.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I note that no timetable has been given by the deputy First  Minister. However, will he urge the Prime Minister and the Treasury of the need  for an indicative timetable, at least, so that the matter can be resolved and  people can have some hope for the future?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: I agree wholeheartedly with everything that the Member said. We  have made the case that the situation needs to be expedited, that people are  enduring great uncertainty about their savings, and that we need to move  forward.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am encouraged by the discussions that we have engaged in  and hopeful that a successful outcome will be arrived at. Obviously, certain  procedures have to be gone through. The Treasury is very cautious about how it  moves forward, and Liam Byrne has attended all the meetings that the First  Minister and I have been at. I think that we are now rapidly moving towards a conclusion,  and I hope that that will be a successful one.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>:  Many savers in the Presbyterian Mutual Society are very happy at the progress  that has been made and the support that has been given by the First Minister  and deputy First Minister and others.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Is the Treasury receiving full co-operation from the  administrators of the Presbyterian Mutual Society?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: I am satisfied that the administrator is co-operating with the  Treasury, and I believe that it, too, is content.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">Flags</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Dr Farry </strong>asked the First Minister and deputy First Minister to provide an update on  the development of an updated inter-agency flags protocol.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  322/10<a name="AQO32210"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: The inter-agency flags protocol that was launched in 2005 is  still operational. Alongside that, we continue to carry out flags monitoring.  However, we recognise that the protocol requires review and updating.  Preliminary work to establish a review process began in the summer with initial  conversations involving existing partners and potential new stakeholders.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A new review group met on 7 October 2009, and a smaller  working group, which was established to take forward views, is revising the  protocol. That progress reflects the importance that we place on a challenging  issue that goes to the heart of our vision to build a shared and better future  based on equality and respect for diversity and on the rule of law.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  thank the deputy First Minister for his answer. On the twentieth anniversary of  the fall of the Berlin Wall, does he recognise that the misuse of national  flags in Northern Ireland  creates division? Does he also recognise that there is concern in the community  about the effectiveness of the current protocol, because it works on the basis  of consent from the community, which is, in effect, code for the consent of  those who put up flags? Statutory agencies are far too reluctant to remove  flags that create divisions and which work against a shared future.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: As I said in my initial answer, the steps taken have given us an  opportunity to move the review forward.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I agree that flags cause tremendous divisions. For example,  I was in my constituency on Friday evening, while it hosted a big boxing match  &mdash; I congratulate Paul McCloskey for winning the European title. Before the  fight, quite a number of loyalist flags were put up in the area that  immediately surrounds the arena that was hosting the fight. I was told that the  people who put them up thought that Paul McCloskey would enter the ring wearing  tricolour shorts, which was never his intention. Local members of the PUP, in  consultation with members of my party, engaged in dialogue, and the flags were  eventually taken down.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That shows that, in addition to the work of the review and  the need to monitor flags in various areas, people should get together to  lessen tension on such issues. There are examples of people from every section  of the community coming together to lessen tensions and to seek remedies.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  I am sure that the Minister could also intervene in the case of the tricolour  sheep if he had a mind to do so.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  I listened to the deputy First Minister&rsquo;s answers to Dr Farry. A review of the  flags protocol was announced by his Office on 22 February, which was nine  months ago. A research paper on the issue by Queen&rsquo;s University was commissioned  by OFMDFM and published in January 2007, which was three years ago. Are we to  assume that the flags protocol is another issue on which the First Minister and  the deputy First Minister cannot agree?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: No; the Member is totally wrong. Queen&rsquo;s University has been  involved in a number of surveys on the issue since 2007. We appreciate the  difficulties that the issue presents in communities. Action has been taken to  update our approach, and I hope that the work of the review group will pay  dividends for all of us.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Does the deputy First Minister agree that there are many  instances in which local efforts at conciliation have not proved successful? In  such instances, will he and his Office support direct action, taken through the  relevant agencies and Departments, to remove flags? In many cases, people are  exasperated at statutory agencies&rsquo; lack of willingness to remove flags.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The nature of the flags does not matter, nor does it matter  whether they are put up along an arterial route, in a shared space or somewhere  that will deliberately get up other people&rsquo;s noses. Departments should make  every effort to have such flags removed, and such action should have been  enshrined in statute by now.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: I agree that there is a responsibility on all of us, including  Departments, to play a role. In the aftermath of the review, I hope that  decisive action will be proposed.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">Policing and Justice Powers</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">6. <strong>Mr P J  Bradley </strong>asked the First Minister and the deputy First Minister what steps  will be taken to assess community confidence for the devolution of policing and  justice, as outlined in their joint letter in November 2008.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 323/10<a name="AQO32310"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: It is the view of OFMDFM that powers should be transferred, which  is a position that we share with all parties in the House.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In November 2008, we agreed a process to give effect to the  transfer of those powers. We note the position of the PSNI and the Policing  Board, which have supported the transfer, as indeed has the judiciary. The  British, Irish and US Governments have done likewise.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In tabling a motion for the transfer of policing and  justice, we are mindful of the Pledge of Office that all Ministers affirmed  when they took up office. It pledges us to serve all the people here equally  and to promote the interests of the whole community. We are determined to work  faithfully through the remaining steps that we identified in November and to  secure the confidence of the community that is necessary for the devolution of  policing and justice functions.</p>

      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Question 1 has been withdrawn.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">Planning: Permitted Development</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr  Bresland </strong>asked the Minister of the Environment when he anticipates the  proposals in the &lsquo;Permitted Development Rights&rsquo; consultation document will come  into effect.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 334/10<a name="AQO33410"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment (Mr Poots)</strong>: The three public consultation exercises seeking  views to extend permitted development rights will run until 22 January 2010. A  detailed analysis of the responses will follow, and work will then begin to  draft a new general permitted development Order, which will, among other  things, contain the new and revised permitted development rights. The extension  of permitted development rights will complement the proposed new planning  reforms and help to promote a speedier, more responsive service. The objective  is to introduce the necessary legislation in time for the transfer of planning  powers to the new councils in 2011.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bresland</strong>:  What benefits will the non-domestic permitted development proposals bring to  the agriculture sector?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: There will be a new permitted change of use of an  agricultural building to a use for making products grown on the farm, farm  shops selling local produce and for storage and distribution uses. We are  prepared to listen to any reasonable case that is put forward during the  consultation process for other sectors of agriculture.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  give a general welcome to the proposal to remove many minor modifications from  the planning system. However, the Planning Service costs several millions of  pounds more each year than it raises in planning fees. The proposal will  further reduce workload and income and increase deficit. Given that loss of  income, how will the Minister balance the books?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I am here to represent the public; I am not here to  represent the Civil Service. We are public representatives, who are here to  deliver more efficient government for the people of Northern Ireland, not to keep civil  servants in jobs that are not required. That is why we are seeking to create a  more efficient planning system and not to have red tape.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">Planning Reform</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Mr  Armstrong </strong>asked the Minister of the Environment for his assessment of the  outcomes of the recent consultation on &lsquo;Reform of the Planning System in Northern Ireland:  Your Chance to Influence Change&rsquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  335/10<a name="AQO33510"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Since the close of the consultation on the proposals for  the reform of the planning system on 2 October, my officials have been  analysing all the formal written responses and the independent report from the  consultation events to determine what impact, if any, they will have on the  policy proposals. Almost 500 people, representing a wide range of sectors and  organisations, attended one or more of the consultation events and 264 formal  written responses were received. As Members can imagine, those comments and  responses reflect a vast array of, often conflicting, viewpoints that  interested parties have on the proposed reforms.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Members will appreciate that I do not want to pre-empt the  process of full policy analysis. With that in mind, it is too early to answer  with certainty the Member&rsquo;s query about the likely final policy direction. I  hope to bring my final policy proposals to the Executive for consideration in  January 2010 to ensure that we stay on course to meet the very tight  legislative timetable for those changes, including the transfer of the majority  of planning functions to the new district councils by 2011.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Armstrong</strong>:  Devolution returned some 30 months ago; when will the Northern Ireland  planning system be modernised and become more responsive to the needs of our  citizens?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The planning system has been reformed and is going through  reform as a result of the decisions that were taken by my predecessors and that  I have taken, and will continue to take, on the Planning Service.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">My Department inherited a planning system that has run up a  significant deficit as a consequence of fewer and smaller planning applications  being lodged and a huge backlog of applications, some of which are seven or  eight years old. Work is continuing to make the Planning Service fit for  purpose, and I am pleased with the progress that has been made thus far. We are  determined to see that through so that we can have a Planning Service of the  highest quality for the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Members should continually rise in their places if they want to be selected to  ask a supplementary question. Some Members seem to have a problem with that.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. The issue of third-party appeals was  raised early in the consultation. If the Minister is not minded to introduce  the right of a third-party appeal, what mechanism will he introduce for the provision  of an independent challenge that would ensure confidence in the planning  system?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The existing proposals do not envisage the introduction of  a right to a third-party appeal. Instead, we will examine the creation of more  opportunities for front-loading so that people can make their views known on a  planning application as early in the process as possible and for developers to  engage in meaningful consultation with the public. That does not preclude the  opportunity of introducing a third-party appeal after the consultation process  is completed. However, when I gave evidence on planning reform to the Committee  for the Environment on Tuesday 3 November, I made it clear that, if we  introduced the right of a third-party appeal, it could not be allowed to cause  a backlog in the system that would result in further delays. It would have to  be designed in such a way that would ensure the efficiency of the process and  would allow decisions to be made earlier and on a regular basis.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  I want to ask the Minister about the extent of the interest that emerged around  the early involvement of stakeholders in any future planning process, and  whether the issue was mentioned in a significant way. Does he intend to issue  draft guidance on that issue to the transition committees?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: There was considerable support for the early involvement  of stakeholders. If we are going to introduce a completely new system to deal  with planning, stakeholder involvement must happen together with it and not in  a disjointed way. Otherwise, it might stymie the efforts of the Planning  Service when it introduces all the aspects of the planning reform proposals. I  do not propose to introduce one aspect of the reforms on its own without  introducing the suite of changes that have been proposed. There has been  considerable support for front-loading.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: I  want to ask the Minister about his comments on third-party appeals and  front-loading of the system. Given that the consultation document suggested  that front-loading should also apply to those who apply to develop and that  they should engage early in the process, and the fact that there is still the  need to have a Planning Appeals Commission to deal with decisions that may be  wrong, does the Minister not accept that there could be circumstances in which  the planners grant permission, and that such decisions could be wrong and need  to be challenged?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: That is a possibility, but I am not prepared to consider a  system that almost eternally blocks planning applications.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will briefly explain one of the systems that I have  considered, which would allow planning decisions to be turned around in eight  weeks. Third-party appeals can kick in, but they will not be permitted if they  are deemed to be vexatious. If the third-party appeal is lost, the persons who  instigated it are often expected to pay for it. We might end up with a system  that incorporates third-party appeals and that could, potentially, deliver a  faster planning process. However, some of the people whom the Member has been  influenced by might not necessarily be looking for that sort of third-party  appeal, and, sometimes, we need to be careful what we ask for.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">Local Government Legislation</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Miss  McIlveen </strong>asked the Minister of the Environment when the local government  reorganisation Bill will be introduced to the Assembly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 336/10<a name="AQO33610"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: It is my intention to introduce the local government  reorganisation Bill to the Assembly by May 2010, subject to Executive  agreement.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  There is clearly a certain urgency to the Bill. Will the Minister confirm  whether consultation on the policy proposals for the Bill has commenced?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The consultation has not yet commenced. The proposals for  consultation have been with my Executive colleagues since June, and I am very  keen to move them forward. There will be consultation on the proposals, so they  are subject to change. I see no reason why they are not in the public domain,  and I wish to have them there. If those proposals are not in the public domain  within the next two weeks, that will cause considerable difficulties in moving  forward and could jeopardise the May 2011 target date for the introduction of  the new councils.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  Although it is predicted that the Bill will save money, bearing in mind that we  are in fiscal crisis, does the Minister see any funding difficulties in the  initial outlay period, when the costs associated with implementing local  government reform are relatively high? Does he acknowledge that the limited  transfer of new powers to local government has limited the potential for  savings?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The powers are limited by what Departments were prepared  to give up; that goes across the range of Departments, including those whose  Ministers are members of the Member&rsquo;s party. A decision has to be taken when  making an investment. The Member comes from a business background and will be  fully aware that if one invests to save, the investment must be carried out at  the appropriate time. It needs to be properly financed, and one has to be  fairly sure of the outcome.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member&rsquo;s point is a valid one. We have indicated that  there are &pound;118 million of potential upfront costs over a five-year period,  which will lead to a saving of &pound;438 million over a 25-year period. Those  indications, which have come from PWC, are what we are basing costs on at the  moment.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: The  Minister expressed his concern that reorganisation might not be in hand by May  2011, but he has so far failed to lay the Order to confirm the local government  boundaries before the House, even though the Local Government Boundaries  Commissioner reported before the summer recess. Will he give an indication as  to why that delay has happened, and will he give a firm commitment that there  will be no gerrymandering to interfere with that report?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: That has been with my Executive colleagues for some time.  I assure the Member that there will be no gerrymandering. The Local Government  (Boundaries) Act (Northern    Ireland) 2008 states:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The 11 local government districts shall incorporate,  respectively, the whole or the major part of the &hellip; former local government  districts&rdquo;.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is a judgement call. Does 55% of the  population or 42% of the business area form the major part of the local  government district? This is not about gerrymandering; it is about getting it  right.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. In light of the damning ruling  delivered by the Equality Commission against Lisburn City Council on 21  October, what safeguards will the Minister put in place to ensure that future  decisions by that council and other councils, including Magherafelt District Council,  will be made to protect and safeguard the rights of minorities?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I thank the Member for his question, and note that Lisburn  Council is not the only one to have been investigated by the Equality  Commission. Limavady Borough Council was also investigated, and had a negative  report.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Regarding the most recent case taken by the Equality  Commission, against Lisburn City Council, a meeting took place last Monday  night at which the Equality Commission was challenged by a range of  councillors, and the chief executive, about the information that it had  gathered before making its decision.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; ">The information that the  Equality Commission gathered, including information that it purported to have  received from my Department, was found to be incorrect. Perhaps if it got its  own house in order and created a better balance in the people that it employs,  the Equality Commission would be given greater cognisance. It is not seen as a  fair employment organisation.</span></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Question 5 has been withdrawn.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">Single Waste Disposal Authority</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">6. <strong>Ms S  Ramsey </strong>asked the Minister of the Environment how he proposes to appoint  members to the single waste disposal authority.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  338/10<a name="AQO33810"></a>)</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">9. <strong>Mrs M  Bradley </strong>asked the Minister of the Environment what assurances he can  provide that, in establishing the single waste authority, local residents will  have an opportunity to express their opinions on the location of new waste  infrastructure facilities.

      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: With your permission, Mr Speaker, I will answer questions  6 and 9 together.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In my statement to the Assembly on 20 October on the local  government reform programme, I advised that I was seeking comments from  stakeholders on an economic appraisal of options for local government service  delivery. Those options include the creation of a single waste disposal  authority for Northern    Ireland. I have asked for comments on the  report to be received by the end of November. Therefore, it is too early to say  how the board of the single waste disposal authority will be constituted and  structured or how its members will be appointed. That will all be the subject  of further and more detailed proposals. However, I can say that the board will  include representatives from the 11 councils and a small number of independent  members.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Waste infrastructure projects are subject to the normal  planning process, which requires the public to be invited to comment on  associated planning applications. It is envisaged that a single waste disposal  authority will be subject to the same legal requirements on planning as the  three existing waste management groups. Therefore, I assure Members that local  residents will be given an opportunity to comment on all planning applications  relating to waste infrastructure. I look forward to receiving Members&rsquo; views on  that aspect of the economic appraisal.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. I thank the Minister for his detailed answer. I appreciate  that he is talking to stakeholders and other people and wishes to receive  comments by the end of November. Therefore, I assume that he will not be able  to state where the authority will be based. Perhaps the Minister will answer  that question in a statement to the Assembly at the end of November or in  December when all the comments have been received. I thank him again for his  initial answer.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: It is far too early to identify where an authority would  be based. Indeed, I first have to get the support of the House and the  Executive to move the process forward. I hope to do right by ratepayers and  have a means of dealing with waste that is as efficient as possible. I hope to  have the strongest available marketing team to bring together all opportunities  available; that the best local solutions for dealing with waste are identified;  and that local input is in no way diminished by having a single authority. It  is very early days, and I look forward to receiving comments on how we should  deal with waste. It is incumbent on us all to work together to get this right.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  The Minister will be aware of the PricewaterhouseCoopers economic appraisal of  local government service delivery, which found that there is significant  support for the concept of a single waste disposal authority. Will the Minister  clarify the basis for that statement by informing us where the support comes  from? Will he also outline how a single waste disposal authority will support  strong local government?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Some of the support came from the bodies that manage  waste; they identified that they have taken things to the present stage. That  approach can continue, or a much more efficient process for dealing with waste  can be created. I can never understand why public representatives tie  themselves to supporting a plethora of organisations, albeit only three in this  case, delivering a service that a smaller number could deliver. The more  management and white-collar workers that we have in place, the higher the costs  associated with delivering the end product, whatever that might be. I want to  deliver efficient government rather than heavily-bureaucratic government.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his answer. Will he share with us the steps that he  proposes to take to ensure that the new single waste authority will give proper  consideration to the thermal treatment of waste?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I thank the Member for the question. There are a whole  series of processes to deal with what we term &ldquo;waste&rdquo;. There is a general  concept that it is not waste in the terms that we once knew it, in that waste  used to be something that we threw into our bins and it all ended up in a  landfill site. There are now recyclates &mdash; materials that are suitable for  thermal processing and anaerobic digestion &mdash; and there may be the possibility  of using energy from waste. We need to look at all of those opportunities,  identify the best solutions, identify which solutions work locally and  implement those solutions in the best interests of the wider public.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">What is not in the best interests of the wider public is  that, in due course, we will be paying &pound;72 for every ton that goes into  landfill. I am happy to look at whatever process can be introduced that might  avoid sending more waste to landfill, which ultimately produces more methane  and damages our environment.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his very detailed and helpful response. One of the  matters that we look at in relation to waste management is recycling  initiatives. Will the Minister give the Assembly some indication of innovative  recycling schemes that could be applicable to the Province?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: There has been quite a lot of innovation in relation to  dealing with our waste, which is why our recycling level has gone from 5% just  seven years ago to around 30% today. I have no doubt whatsoever that members of  the public, the business community and organisations like Bryson Charitable  Group and others that are involved in the recycling of waste will have no  shortage of quality ideas coming forward about how to better manage articles of  waste. I will be very happy to respond to all of them.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">Recycling</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">7. <strong>Mr  McCartney</strong>asked the Minister of the Environment whether he has any  plans to request that the Treasury make available all monies raised through  landfill tax for reclaim by Local Authorities to fund approved, innovative,  recycling schemes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 339/10<a name="AQO33910"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The issue of tax, including the landfill tax, is a  reserved matter. All of the money that is raised goes to the UK Exchequer.  Since 2003-04, as a Barnett consequential, Northern Ireland has received an  allocation from the landfill tax. However, there is no direct link between the  area in which the revenue is raised and where it is spent. The use of all  funding that is allocated through the Barnett formula is a matter for the  Executive.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Some further landfill taxes are returned to Northern Ireland  through the Landfill Communities Fund. Apart from that, there is no mechanism  for Northern Ireland  to reclaim the tax. My Department continues to work with district councils and  other stakeholders to improve waste management and has already secured significant  funding to assist in delivering improvements. The Department&rsquo;s &pound;200 million  capital strategic waste infrastructure fund will help to increase recycling  rates and ultimately reduce the burden on ratepayers across Northern Ireland.  The support that is provided by the Department to the Waste and Resources  Action Programme to work with district councils also promotes the use of  recycling activities and the reduction of waste going in to landfill.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as a  fhreagra.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am very mindful of the Minister&rsquo;s previous answers when I  frame this question: does he agree that we should use money in innovative ways  to ensure that the recycling process continues and that people will see the  direct link to saving in relation to landfill, and also to ensure that there is  innovative recycling in the future?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: There is the opportunity to do that in the Landfill  Communities Fund. I understand that, since 2003-04, Northern Ireland has received  approximately &pound;3 million each year under the Barnett formula for landfill tax.  The scheme commenced in 1996 and was subsequently replaced by the Landfill  Communities Fund. Since 1996, a total of &pound;17&middot;6 million has been spent on  projects in Northern Ireland,  of which &pound;5&middot;2 million has been spent in the past five years. Ultimately, if the  Members have good ideas coming forward from local people, communities or  businesses, we will certainly be happy to look at those.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I call Thomas Burns to ask a supplementary question, and I again remind Members  to rise in their places when they want to ask a question.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burns</strong>:  What consideration has the Minister given to an all-island approach to the  marketing of recyclable materials? That market is an important one,  particularly in these harsh economic times.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The first step to having the all-island market that Mr  Burns wants is to get an all-Northern Ireland one. Perhaps he will tell  his colleague Mrs Mary Bradley that a single waste authority would assist us  greatly in doing that. First steps must be taken before the next can be taken.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We have been considering the potential of an all-island  paper mill. At present, markets do not support that. However, I assured the  House earlier today that we would continue to look at that issue in years to  come. Developments will depend on how the markets play out. At the moment,  recycled materials are down substantially in value, although they have risen to  2007, as opposed to 2008, values.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">Planning: North    Road, Carrickfergus</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">8. <strong>Mr Hilditch </strong>asked the Minister of the Environment how many planning applications have  been submitted for apartments on the North    Road, Carrickfergus in the last three years.&nbsp; (AQO 340/10<a name="AQO34010"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: In the past three years, my Department received 17 planning  applications, including some for apartments on North Road in Carrickfergus. Of those 17,  11 have been determined, with nine applications approved and two refused.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hilditch</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer. I do not expect him to be aware of the  area specifically, but North Road  is one of the town&rsquo;s arterial routes. As further planning applications come  forward, will he assure elected representatives and the local public that the  Planning Service will take into account the significant change in character and  infrastructure that the area is experiencing?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I have received correspondence on the issue from  Carrickfergus Borough Council. In the first instance, I have offered to have a  meeting with the head of the Planning Service to see whether we can resolve the  issue satisfactorily. The matter is obviously of significant concern to local  public representatives.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The addendum that I proposed this morning to Planning  Policy Statement 7 might be of some assistance, albeit that it may be limited  in helping the Planning Service to deal with this issue, which involves an  arterial route. However, an initial meeting with the chief executive may drill  down to some of the issues and identify the real problems.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">Plastic Bag Levy</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">11. <strong>Mr  McKay </strong>asked the Minister of the Environment when he will make a decision on  the possible introduction of a plastic bag levy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 343/10<a name="AQO34310"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I have no immediate plans to decide whether to introduce a  levy on plastic bags.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his answer. His statement today is disappointing.  However, has he considered carrying out public consultation to ascertain the  opinion of local people on the issue of a plastic bag levy?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Ultimately, we want to reduce the use of plastic bags, but  whether we will be required to introduce taxation to achieve that is another  matter. The voluntary approach that was announced in July this year resulted in  supermarkets in Northern Ireland reducing the number of single-use carrier bags  by 38%, which equated to 7&middot;6 million fewer bags being handed out. Therefore, we  are clearly having success.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A number of issues are related to plastic bags. When the  Republic, for instance, started charging for plastic bags, there was noticeable  increase in the number of bin bags that were bought. Bin bags take longer than  plastic bags to disintegrate in waste, and they are heavier. Therefore, the  introduction of a tax to reduce the use of plastic bags will not result in  advantages all the way. We must encourage people, cajole them, lead them and  bring them with us in an effort to reduce the use of plastic bags. A  close-to-40% reduction is very significant. Let us build on that and encourage  more people to refuse plastic bags in shops.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>:  Does the Minister concur that not only is a voluntary scheme preferable, but it  is the favoured option of those in the industry?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Yes, it is. As I said to Mr McKay earlier today, it has  been clearly identified that the people whom it would hurt most are those who  have the least money. I am not inclined to make people on the breadline suffer  more, which may be Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s new policy. I am not inclined to introduce new  taxes that hurt people on the breadline, whether on the Falls Road or the Shankill Road.</p>

      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="8"></a>Committee Business</p>
      <p class="H4StageHeading">Efficiency and Contingency Deficit Proposals in the  Health and Social Care Trusts</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Debate resumed on amendment to motion:</p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly calls on the Minister of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety to outline the details of the efficiency savings  proposals agreed with each health and social care trust; and to ensure that the  efficiency savings proposals and contingency proposals for deficits in the  current budget of each trust will not impact on front line services. &mdash; <em>[The  Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public  Safety (Mrs O&rsquo;Neill).]</em></p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Which amendment was:</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">At end insert</p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;; and further requests that  the Executive exempts health and social care services from further budget  reductions or requirements to deliver any further efficiency savings.&rdquo; &mdash; <em>[Mr  McCallister.]</em></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for Health,  Social Services and Public Safety (Mrs O&rsquo;Neill)</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank all Members who contributed to  the debate on efficiencies and deficiencies in the Health Service, which is an  important subject because it affects everybody in the North. It is worth taking  a few moments to summarise the financial situation that the trusts are facing.<em> [Interruption.]</em></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. Members should leave the Chamber in an orderly fashion.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>:  First, under RPA, the trusts have had to take on the legacy trusts&rsquo; debts. The  new trusts must clear those debts, so they are not starting off with a clean  sheet.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, over three years, the trusts must make 9%  efficiency savings &mdash; more than &pound;344 million. It pays to remind ourselves that  40% of all efficiency savings must come from the health budget. Therefore, any  slippage or non-delivery will have a disproportionate impact. For example, the  Belfast Health and Social Care Trust is expected to deliver &pound;92 million of  efficiency savings over three years. That is more than one quarter of the total  efficiency savings that are expected from the Health Service or 11&middot;5% of the  total efficiencies from all Departments.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Thirdly, the fact that the break-even duty will not  tolerate any overspend has, in effect, created the need for deficit contingency  plans. If a trust cannot live within its budget, it must create contingency  plans to show the cuts that will be made to bring it back to break-even.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, the Minister has not bothered to come back  to the Chamber to listen to the winding-up speeches. Nevertheless, I shall  refer to his comment that there is no 0&middot;5% leeway. If he had listened to my  contribution, he would have realised that I was suggesting that that is one  possible way to introduce some flexibility into a rigid system to restore what  was previously available to the legacy trusts.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We now know that the health and social care trusts are  finding it tough, and we all recognise that there are massive challenges. A  huge amount of change has taken place in a short time. There have been changes  to the structure of the Health Service due to the RPA and changes to the way in  which people are treated as new thinking and drugs come online, the level of  demand increases, and patients and their families rightly have higher  expectations. Against that background of change, it is perhaps not surprising  that the trusts have budget difficulties. However, as I said, it is surprising  how well some of them are dealing with the issues.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I shall now turn to the contributions that were made during  the debate. John McCallister moved the amendment, on which the Committee did  not take a position, so I cannot speak about it on behalf of the Committee.  However, as Sinn Fein&rsquo;s health spokesperson, I can say that, for many of the  reasons that my colleague Sue Ramsey outlined, Sinn F&eacute;in will not support the  amendment. The amendment assumes that no efficiencies can be made in health.  Making efficiency savings and protecting front line services are not mutually  exclusive. Efficiencies must be achieved if we are to protect front line  services.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Iris Robinson noted that health is the number one priority,  and she referred to the Minister&rsquo;s public statement that he would not make cuts  to front line staff. Mrs Robinson further suggested that the public outcry  about the cuts that would be required to stay within budget was music to the  Minister&rsquo;s ears, and that the health and social care system can keep its  efficiency savings and plough them back into the new system. She referred to  the new situation in which the Department of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety finds itself.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Carmel Hanna said that we need to spend public money wisely  and that it is essential to justify all programmes. She went on to say that she  cannot support one area of public spending being exempt from efficiency savings  at the expense of others. All budgets, including the budget for swine flu, must  be constantly monitored.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Dr Deeny also referred to health as being the number one  public priority. He mentioned a patient in his practice who was kept waiting  for hours for a hospital bed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Dr Deeny also referred to the scaling down of  administrative and management staff. He welcomed that moves have been made in  the right direction but said that that more needed to be done and referred to  the number of directors in the Belfast Trust. Dr Deeny also noted the shift of  focus from secondary to primary care and stressed that the funding needed to  follow it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Alex Easton said that in 2010-2011, the health budget will  have grown from &pound;3&middot;5 billion in 2007 to &pound;4 billion. The Department is already  allowed to keep its efficiency savings. Mr Easton asked the Minister to explain  the workings of the control fund, and I believe that the Minister failed to do  so in his contribution. Mr Easton went on to say that the decision to cut front  line services lies firmly with the Minister. He also said that the DUP has  identified &pound;7 million to &pound;8 million in savings: perhaps we will learn more  about that as time goes on.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Sue Ramsey noted that the Health Committee had brought the  motion as a result of a lack of information from the Minister. She recognised  that the Health Service is underfunded, but also said that there was wastage,  such as the use of taxis to transfer records. Ms Ramsey also said that she had  asked for information on whether any chief executive of a legacy trust had been  held to account for the legacy debt that the trusts have incurred. Again, the  Minister, in his contribution to the debate, did not pick up on that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Simon Hamilton said that there is still scope for savings  in the Health Service. He said that there has been a large increase in  administrators, managers and senior managers. Again, perhaps the Minister will  explain that in time.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">An issue arose about the failure of the Department to  answer questions. In response, the Minister talked about the cost of answering  questions. However, it is the democratic right of any Member to ask questions  of the Minister. I wonder how much it cost the Minister to find out how much it  costs the Department to answer a question.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Simon Hamilton went on to say that exempting the Department  from efficiency savings will increase the need for cuts in other areas, such as  housing, which is the responsibility of DSD, and in other Departments.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Declan O&rsquo;Loan noted that pressures due to efficiency  savings are very apparent in the Health Service and that productivity is well  below that in England and Wales. He also said that he wanted to hear about the  often-cited 9% rise in demand, though he conceded that there is always demand  for new drugs and new technologies. Mr O&rsquo;Loan also said that it is  over-simplistic to maintain that all cuts should be made only in administration  and management. He said that deficits had now been addressed, but only at the  cost of new service provision.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I turn to the Minister&rsquo;s contribution. He accused the  Health Committee of attacking the productivity of healthcare workers. In my  contribution, I recognised that front line staff do an excellent job: had the  Minister been listening, he would have heard that. I raised the issue of  productivity only to make comparison with other jurisdictions. I realise that  part of the productivity gap is down to reliance in the North on older  equipment and poorer facilities.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The whole point of the debate is to seek information about  the extent of the deficits of each trust. However, instead of providing us with  that information, the Minister gave us his single transferable speech once  more. We are still in the dark as to how the trusts will break even in this  financial year.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister referred to the issue of answering questions.  I have addressed that issue.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I finish on this note: I am disappointed by the Minister&rsquo;s  contribution. I am disappointed that, once more, he did not refer to wastage in  the Health Service and that he did not recognise that there are efficiencies to  be achieved. The Minister maintained that front line services are not being  affected. Let me give him a dose of reality. We have heard about delays in the  implem&shy;entation of new service developments in the Northern Trust; that affects  front line services, whatever way one chooses to look at it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank everyone who has contributed to the debate. Their  contributions are most welcome. Go raibh maith agat.</p>

      <p class="H4StageHeading">Multi-unit Development &nbsp;Management Company Reform</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30 minutes for  the debate. The proposer will have 10 minutes in which to propose the motion  and 10 minutes in which to make a winding-up speech. One amendment has been  selected and published on the Marshalled List. The proposer of the amendment  will have 10 minutes in which to propose and five minutes in which to make a  winding-up speech. All other Members who wish to speak will have five minutes.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That this Assembly notes that the regulations on  multi-unit development management companies are not currently adequate; notes  that Northern Ireland has fallen behind the rest of the United Kingdom and the  Republic of Ireland in legislating on this issue; and calls on the Department  of Finance and Personnel and the Executive to develop proposals on the matter.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">On behalf of the many concerned apartment owners in Northern Ireland,  I am grateful to my colleagues, and to the Business Committee, for agreeing to  the debate on this very important issue.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  Will the Member give way?<em> [Laughter.]</em></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  No. I have 15 minutes&rsquo; worth of speaking notes and I have been allowed only 10  minutes. If I have time at the end of my contribution, I will give way to the  Member. That is as good as I can do.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">By the end of the debate I hope that the entire House will  have agreed that there is a problem that greatly affects apartment owners, and,  as a local Assembly, will have agreed to do what it can to rectify that problem.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There are 40,000 apartment owners in Northern Ireland,  and, as it is a relatively new way of living here, owners have discovered many  problems with the non-completion of work by management companies. Those  companies are given a fairly substantial monthly payment and are responsible  for all common areas around apartment blocks.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There are many very good and efficient management companies  in Northern Ireland  that provide a good service. However, I want rules, regulations and  legislation, as in other regions of the United   Kingdom, to ensure that all management companies in Northern Ireland  carry out the duties for which they are paid and provide apartment owners with  a quality service. At present, that is not happening.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion calls on the Minister of Finance and Personnel  and his Executive colleagues to acknowledge the problem and to propose  legislation that deals with management companies. I am grateful that Minister  Wilson is in the Chamber today, and I remind him &mdash; should he need reminding &mdash;  that when he was Minister of the Environment he acknowledged that there was a  problem in this area.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">At that time, Minister Wilson said that he had received a  number of complaints from constituents, and he called for action to protect the  growing number of apartment dwellers from shoddy services provided by property  management companies. He said that he believed that Stormont &mdash; that is us &mdash;  should introduce new regulations to ensure that money that is paid out by  apartment owners is used to service their property blocks. We all agree on  that, and now that Mr Wilson has been promoted to Minister of Finance and  Personnel, let us see him put his money where his mouth is. I am quite sure  that he will.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Both of Minister Wilson&rsquo;s predecessors were not as  positive. When Mr Robinson and Mr Dodds held the position of Minister of  Finance and Personnel, in reply to a question, both said that they were not  persuaded that there was a need, at the time, to prioritise consideration of  leaseholder reform. The most recent reply to that effect was received in  September 2008, which is more than a year ago. I hope that our new Minister  will perhaps agree that now the time is right to put apartment owners at ease.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Members have had access to the information pack that was  compiled by the Assembly&rsquo;s Research and Library Services. I warmly commend all  staff who were involved in producing that. All relevant information has been  condensed in that pack, including press coverage during the period 2008-09,  when the issue seemed to come to the fore.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">One media report asked the question:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Can we get rid of  our management firm?...The property management company for our block of flats  is shambolic &mdash; filthy floors, poor maintenance, rip-off charges&rdquo;.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Those owners are at their wits&rsquo; end, and it appears  that very little has been or can be done, unless and until regulation and  legislation is introduced in Northern    Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">One apartment owner was told that the property was devalued  by 20% because the corridors and gardens of the building were not being  properly maintained, despite the fact that the owner was paying a high monthly  premium for that work to be done. That cannot be right, nor allowed to  continue. Another apartment owner who uses a wheelchair came to see me in this  Building some time ago and told a similar story. He had paid his service  charges, but, on many occasions, the lift at his apartment block was not  working. After chasing the management company for a better service, he was finally  forced to directly contact the lift company, only to be told that the service  contract had not been renewed. That is absolutely unacceptable. Another owner  reported that thousands of pounds were unaccounted for from their apartment  block bank account. It was later discovered that efforts had been made by the  company to change the records.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The information in the many written testimonies that I have  received is truly shocking. In another case, after several years of living in  an apartment block, the owners discovered that they were not shareholders in  the management company. For some reason, the solicitors never vested the common  areas from the developer. Instead, the builder passed ownership to his own  accountant, who, in turn, collected thousands of pounds in service charges from  the apartment owners, with no work or maintenance to show for it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Those experiences have convinced me not only of the need  for legislative reform in Northern    Ireland, but of the precise measures that we  need to enact to solve the problem. My research demonstrates that the solution  to the problem has an advantage in that it involves changes that are entirely  within the competence of the Assembly to bring about.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As I said earlier, Northern   Ireland lags behind other regions of the UK and  certainly behind the South of Ireland, where, as recently as May 2009, Minister  Dermot Ahern published the Multi-Unit Developments Bill, which will introduce  sweeping reforms for the owners of existing and new apartment and multi-unit  residential complexes. The Minister said that the Bill will introduce:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;a comprehensive legislative framework to cater for  the specific needs of apartment owners in multi-unit developments. Existing  legislation under which property management companies operate is inadequate to  deal with and resolve the various difficulties being experienced by individual  apartment owners.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That Bill will allow apartment owners much more peace of  mind and will certainly greatly improve legal protection. That is exactly what  is required in Northern    Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Molloy] in the Chair)</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that the House can unite to vote in favour of the  motion so that apartment owners all over Northern Ireland can have  confidence in their Assembly to modernise and legislate for some of the serious  problems that they have encountered. The issue does not only affect apartment  owners, the value of the properties and their level of outgoings; it affects  management agents of good standing and repute, to whom I referred earlier. They  have asked me to do something because they are sick of being tarred with the  same brush as rogue management companies. This is our opportunity to allow  apartment owners to see progress and to end their nightmare once and for all.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Speaker, I could spend the rest of the afternoon  relating many horror stories from apartment owners of how they have had a raw  deal from their management companies, but you would not allow me. Some of those  people have even had to go to the courts. It is essential that everything is in  place, including proper insurance, proper emergency planning and proper fire  prevention policies.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member should bring his remarks to a close.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  All apartment owners must have up-to-date information. The Assembly has the chance  to address the problem, and I ask all Members to support the motion.  Unfortunately, the amendment does not offer anything beyond the original  proposal.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  I beg to move the following amendment: Leave out all after &lsquo;adequate&rsquo; and  insert</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;and calls on the Executive to introduce new  legislation that will govern the way in which they operate&rdquo;.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the proposer for tabling the motion, although I am  a bit confused by what he said. He said that he spoke to other Ministers about  the topic, and he said that the DUP amendment does not go far enough because it  relates to the Executive. I have been communicating with the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment on the matter for some time, and she has afforded me an opportunity,  with others, to meet some of her officials to discuss the issue. I will read a  response that I received from the Minister that refers to a meeting in March  2009.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Before I read that, however, I should mention that my  colleague Alastair Ross and I tried to table a motion on the same subject as Mr  McCarthy. We thought that the issue was important, and I am glad that it is  being debated. Unfortunately for us, Kieran got in before us.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I was quick off the mark, Trevor.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  I would not describe it that way.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister&rsquo;s reply referred to the fact that the Office  of Fair Trading had evidence relating to the issue, and I understand that there  were similar problems in Scotland.  She said:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;I understand that the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform  Act 2002 (which applies to England  and Wales  and which is primarily housing legislation) seeks to protect the tenancy rights  of occupiers of the kind of developments you have discussed&rdquo;.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That response refers to an issue that comes under  the remit of DSD, as opposed to DFP.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister also pointed out in her letter that the  Department of the Environment has an interest through its Northern Ireland  planning policy OS 2, &lsquo;Public Open Space in New Residential Development&rsquo;. When  my colleague and I were formulating a motion on this subject, we felt that it  should be directed at the Executive, rather than simply at DFP. I thank Arlene  Foster for the meetings that we have had.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McCarthy has given good examples of the problem. No one  will disagree that there is a problem. We all recognise it. The issue is how  the Assembly deals with it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I was first introduced to the problem when residents from  the Victoria Road  in Ballyclare visited my office. In common with all buyers of new properties,  they were signing up to an arrangement with a management company and putting  the matter in the hands of a solicitor. They were concerned that they did not  understand the arrangement with the management company. They knew that they had  to pay an annual amount of money but did not know what it was for. With the  contracts signed, sealed and delivered, they were caught in a trap. At their  AGM, the residents discovered that they had no voting rights and could not appoint  directorships to their own management company.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As Mr McCarthy said, not all management companies are  unscrupulous, but, unfortunately, some do exploit people in Northern Ireland,  and they are the subject of today&rsquo;s debate. There must be protection for consumers  against them.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In the situation that I described, the managing agent holds  so many shares that there is no intention of completing the development, which  would allow its management to be transferred to another company. In a sense, it  is a closed shop: other companies are prevented from taking over that company&rsquo;s  duties and there is no input from people who live in the development. That  situation is totally unacceptable and must be changed. Regulation is needed for  those reasons.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I make no apology for naming the management company that is  involved in that case: Brackenwood Property Management Ltd. It appoints all its  own internal interests. Residents should get best value for the money that they  pay to the management agent for their development. I believe that, in that  instance, the agent used its own internal grounds maintenance and other similar  services. Therefore, there is no clear trail that can demonstrate that best  value was sought for the consumer.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">People who have been present at meetings that I have had  with DETI officials have told horror stories, which get worse, about other developments.  We heard about a recent case that involved a development in Belfast where residents had paid money in  good faith to the management company only to find out that insurance for the  apartment block in which they lived had been withdrawn. That is an absolute  horror story &mdash; a nightmare scenario &mdash; for those residents, who paid money in  good faith to an unscrupulous company, which is prepared to take that money for  its own gain and is not interested in the people whom it is there to serve.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Around 2006, the property management company, DMS, went  bust. Although that was probably fortunate for the residents of an apartment  block in Belfast in the longer term, initially, it was unfortunate because, due  to the company&rsquo;s non-payment for electricity, for which, I believe, a case was  taken against it, those residents had to pay service charges twice. Those  residents paid money in good faith to an unregulated management company. That  company went to the wall, leaving those individuals to pay twice for electricity.  That is absolutely unacceptable. For those reasons, protection measures must be  brought in.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McCarthy said that the situation with management  companies is new. It is not new; it has been ongoing for a few years. The  problems are starting to arise. I am worried that people pay money in good  faith to management companies. People who live in apartments are probably the  most vulnerable. After a few years, when problems have started to develop, an  unscrupulous agent can pull out and leave no money for residents for the upkeep  of their properties. The opportunity has been created for agents to leave  residents in dire straits. They can take money out of a sinking fund and leave  residents in no position to enhance or repair their properties to a good state.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: The  Member said that the situation has been going on for a few years. He talked  about DETI&rsquo;s role, referred to DOE&rsquo;s responsibility for planning, and suggested  that the Minister of Finance and Personnel might be able to act. Does the  Member agree that it is now imperative that all those Departments get together  to ensure that they bring forward relevant legislation to address the issue? Is  that not preferable to the original motion, which aims to persuade one Minister  to act, and would not result in the collective action that is required?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  I appreciate the Member&rsquo;s intervention, and I agree wholeheartedly with him. I  was trying to highlight that need for collective action in the Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment&rsquo;s response. She was more than happy to  facilitate meetings on more than one occasion. The Minister accepts that her  Department has a responsibility, and does not shun that. In her response,  however, she identified that DSD and DOE also have a responsibility. A  collective decision is required, and that is why the amendment calls on the  Executive to act. I hope that, when we reach the end of the debate, Kieran and  his party will accept the amendment.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. While listening to the proposer of  the motion and, subsequently, to the proposer of the amendment, I was struck by  how much common ground there is between them. My party also shares that common  ground, and it is a pity that the Assembly has not yet developed a mechanism whereby  such commonalities could be advanced to the point of an agreed motion. As has  been explained in some detail, the current procedures mean that the  determination on which motion came before the House was simply a matter of  timing.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: For  the Member&rsquo;s information, my party approached the Alliance Party to try to  agree wording to which we could all sign up. Unfortunately, however, that did  not happen, because Mr McCarthy was keen that it remain a purely Alliance Party  motion.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  I have no doubt about that, because I have been in a similar situation in the  past. Given the impact on the Assembly&rsquo;s time and effort, I suggest a formal  mechanism whereby the Business Office and, perhaps, the Assembly Commission  should attempt to facilitate discussions when there is such a united front as  exists in this case. I agree so strongly with Members who have spoken that I do  not intend to rehearse their arguments. I simply put on record that they have  ably stated the case.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Good and best practice is available elsewhere. Every party  will testify to having heard similar complaints from tenants in their  constituencies. People who share common facilities need to be protected from  unscrupulous contractors. As Mr Clarke pointed out, that does not, by any means,  apply to all contractors. However, there are sufficient grounds for concern  and, therefore, sufficient grounds to put in place legislation to address the  issue. Some practices are clearly unscrupulous, and many tenants do not have a  clear idea of the degree and quality of services for which they pay. They do  not know how they can hold people to account or insist on a better service.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Often, when the leases of apartments are passed on, or new  tenancies in the private rented sector are passed on to a second or third  generation of tenant, the detail of the original contracts is lost in the mists  of time. That is a recipe for the abuse that now exists. Sinn F&eacute;in is  comfortable with supporting the motion as amended or the original motion,  because they draw attention to an issue that must be addressed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It seemed from the speech of the motion&rsquo;s proposer that  there may be resistance to the motion. That is disappointing, and I cannot  comprehend the reasons for such resistance; perhaps the Minister will  elaborate. I imagined that the Executive would be keen to address the matter.  They could do that with the minimum of fuss and effort, and they should.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The issue cries out for us to support people who are, in  some instances, manifestly the victims of unscrupulous business practices. We  should be prepared to confront that unscrupulousness. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I call Mr Danny Kinahan.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Did you call Danny Kinahan or Danny Kennedy, Mr Deputy Speaker? I am Danny  Kennedy.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:  I am aware of that. I called Mr Kinahan, but if Mr Kennedy wishes to speak  first, that it is OK.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  He ranks higher than Mr Kinahan.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  I am very happy to let my colleague speak first. <em>[Laughter.]</em></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  He is pulling rank.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Mr Wilson would do so, too.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this  important debate and to my esteemed colleague Danny Kinahan for allowing me to  speak before him.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Members who tabled the motion. As has been  mentioned, more and more people in Northern Ireland are choosing to  live in apartments and flats. It is apparent that the regulations that surround  the management of communal spaces are not as robust as they should be and, as  the motion states, that they fall short of those that exist in Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  I asked the Member to give way because I know that he has enjoyed standing up  and sitting down during the debate.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Kennedy referred to the issue of apartments. Does he  accept that the regulations relate to developments other than just apartments?  People sometimes get confused, but given the open space element, the  regulations cover houses, town houses and apartments.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member has an extra minute.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I thank the Member for his contribution, and I accept the important difference.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I note that the Northern Ireland Law Commission has  consulted on whether reform of that area of law should form part of its first  work programme, and I understand that it is to report on the content of that  programme this month. I hope that the report will contain proposals for reform.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Weak regulations can lead to two main problems for owners,  particularly apartment owners. First, they are not given the guarantees that  are needed. The money that they pay to a management company should be used  appropriately to do the work necessary to maintain the structure and aesthetic  integrity of communal spaces and buildings. However, I am particularly  concerned that many agreements do not have a sink-fund option, which means that  apartment owners in particular may be left with a significant bill for  non-planned or irregular maintenance work. That problem has been somewhat  exacerbated during the recession, with many management companies going under or  not completing their work, thereby leaving owners in great difficulty.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The second problem for owners is that the lack of  regulations surrounding management companies, to use the words of the Law  Commission:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;creates a complicated web of legal relationships&rdquo;.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That means that, unless competent solicitors put in place a  competent conveyancing agreement from the beginning, the sale of a flat can be  prejudiced if lenders, such as banks and building societies, indicate  unhappiness with the legal arrangements. The housing market is still in serious  difficulties, and any further burdens would be unwelcome. The apartment market  is often attractive to first-time buyers, and any complications that limit  their ability to get on the property ladder must be addressed as soon as  possible.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The provisions that have been introduced in Great Britain and in the Republic of Ireland  vary. For example, there is more flexibility in English and Welsh legislation  to allow owners to establish their own management companies than appears to  exist in the legislation that was recently introduced in the Republic of Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">However, both jurisdictions allow for much greater  accountability and input into the management of buildings by owners, which  creates greater accountability and better financial and maintenance management.  It is good for the individuals involved and, ultimately, it will be good for  the housing market, which, rightly or wrongly, has formed a significant part of  our economy in recent years.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister of Finance and Personnel has already stated  publicly that he is in favour of addressing the issue. The Minister said:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the only situation I know where people pay money  and there is no guarantee of service.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Therefore, I hope that the Minister will look at  the motion and take into consideration the views of the House.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I note the Law Commission&rsquo;s work programme, and I hope that  the issue will be brought forward. If it is not, I hope that the Minister and  the Executive will make it a priority. I support the motion.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  The motion must be one of the more mysterious to appear on the Order Paper.  When it initially appeared, there was a great deal of head scratching among  Members and researchers &mdash; including the Assembly&rsquo;s Research and Library Service  &mdash; as to what the motion referred. Although a little bit more clarity has  emerged, the initial reaction says something about whether tabling a motion was  the best mechanism by which to bring the issue forward. I will say more about  that later.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It appears that there is a significant issue &mdash; in certain  places, at any rate &mdash; in relation to people in apartments paying heavy charges  and not getting the proper benefits in return.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In England  and Wales,  the issue was addressed way back in 2002 with the Commonhold and Leasehold  Reform Act 2002. In Scotland,  the issue has been much studied with what are referred to as &ldquo;cowboy&rdquo; property  managers being the central issue. It is not clear what exact remedies they have  come up with in Scotland.  However, reference has been made to creating a register of property managers  and to easier remedies for residents.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The biggest changes that I have seen are in Ireland, where,  following the great growth in apartment dwelling, the issue has been perceived  as a huge problem. In May 2009, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law  Reform introduced the Multi-Unit Development Bill to improve the regulation of  multi-unit developments.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">When bringing that legislation forward, the Minister  referred to purchasers of apartments who may not realise the implications of  their ownership and the responsibilities involved in being a member of a  property management company. One issue that may not have affected us yet is  that when apartment dwellings are new, maintenance issues may not be pressing.  However, over the passage of time &mdash; as has occurred in England and Wales &mdash; significant refurbishment  may be required and there may be heavy charges on residents. People need to be  ready for that and to recognise their legal responsibilities.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The purpose of the Irish Bill is improved legal protection  for apartment owners and an improvement in the management and maintenance of  the internal and external common areas in apartment complexes.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I notice that that Bill was preceded by a report on the  matter by the Law Reform Commission. That is the right order in which to do  things: a problem needs to be studied before proposals can be made to address  the issue. As far as I can see, before the motion was brought forward, there  was very little examination of the issue in the Assembly. Kieran McCarthy asked  the Minister a couple of questions, and, interestingly, the Minister showed  little interest in making any proposals.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">When the present Minister of Finance was Minister of the  Environment, he said, on record, that the matter needed to be addressed.  However, his colleague, the then Finance Minister, did not show the same  interest. The issue should have been tested at Committee before it was brought  before the Assembly.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The amendment should not have been tabled.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: The  Member said that the issue should have been discussed at Committee. In which  Committee would he like the issue discussed? As we heard, the issue affects  DFP, DETI, DSD and, importantly for planning regulations, DOE.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  do not know. When Mr McCarthy submitted questions on the matter, they were  assigned to the Minister of Finance and Personnel, although I am open to  correction. The Minister of Finance and Personnel is here to respond; I presume  that his attendance was discussed in the Executive, so he is here for a good  reason.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  It was in the motion.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  Just because the Minister is referred to in the motion, it is not obligatory  for him to respond. If it was not appropriate for him to respond, he would not  be here.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  I am confused by the Member&rsquo;s response. He said that he thought that the issue  would be better discussed at Committee, and my colleague asked him which one.  The Member came with an assumption that the issue should be discussed at a  Committee; all we are trying to find out is which Committee would be best to  discuss it.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  have already answered that. I do not claim to be an expert on which Department  is responsible for the matter. I note that the Minister of Finance and  Personnel is here to respond, so I assume that he has accepted some  responsibility for the matter.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The amendment is not particularly constructive. The motion  calls on the Minister of Finance and Personnel and the Executive to develop  proposals on the matter. In proposing the motion, Mr McCarthy referred to  legislation. Therefore, it would be sensible for the Department of Finance to  research the issue, identify problems that undoubtedly exist, devise some  remedies and bring them to the Finance Committee. I have no difficulty with  other Committees being involved. I hope that the Members who tabled the  amendment will not push it to a Division.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I support the amendment. I thank the Members who tabled the motion and the  amendment for bringing them to the Chamber and giving us a chance to speak on  the issue.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">With the hike in house prices in the past few years, the  attraction of an apartment has grown steadily stronger, and that applies to  properties other than apartments. Increasing numbers of young people are  finding that a two- or three-bedroom apartment is much more affordable and  suitable to their needs. They are branching out in that direction, because  their pocket allows them to.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The problem in the Province is that there is no regulation  of apartment blocks or housing developments. Legislation on that issue was  introduced in the UK  mainland, which should be considered for Northern Ireland. Many who purchase  apartments in multi-unit developments do not fully realise the type of ownership  arrangement into which they are entering and the responsibilities involved in  membership of the property management company.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In some cases, developers have been slow to transfer  ownership of common areas to property management companies. Those delays have  caused frustration for owners who want to get involved in managing and  maintaining their developments.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Tha Nationel Kinsoomer Assosiation faer fawed tha publishin  o&rsquo; Muckle-Unit Developmunt Bill oan tha maenlan, saein that it haud maed a  lerge step fort fer tha lukin efter o&rsquo; fowk leevin in  apertmunts an muckle-unit developmunts.

      <p class="B3BodyText">The National Consumer Council welcomed the publication of a  Multi-Unit Development Bill, saying that it represented a major step forward in  the protection of consumers who are living in apartments in multi-unit  developments. With increasing numbers of people living in multi-unit  developments, there is a clear need for regulation of the industry.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Many owners in multi-unit developments have found  themselves in difficult positions arising from poor operation and management of  their developments. I know of one development in which the management company  was taking money from each apartment owner for a maintenance superintendant,  yet no one had been appointed and the money ended up &mdash;dare I say? &mdash; lining the  pockets of either the management company or the developers. That highlights the  need for legislation to act as a protective barrier. Residents must have  protection that will give them a greater say in how their developments are  managed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Developers and builders must protect the ownership rights  of people who live in the houses and apartments and ensure that upkeep and  maintenance are carried out and that properties do not deteriorate.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">My colleague Trevor Clarke mentioned insurance cover. A  constituent visited me last week to say that he does not know how long he has  been without insurance cover. I thank the Lord that there has not been a fire or  other problems in his property. He discovered that his property has no  insurance because he cannot contact the company.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  Is the Member aware that, when people buy into those types of development, the  agent can increase the service charge without explanation?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member has an extra minute in which to speak.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  That is another complication of the process; it highlights the need for  legislative change in Northern    Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In 2006, the National Consumer Council carried out a survey  to discover which issues were important to owners. Such matters must be  examined in the context of Northern    Ireland during any consideration of  legislation. Specific issues must be addressed in legislation, such as the  transfer of the common areas to the ownership of an owners&rsquo; management company,  changes in voting rights, transparency in the calculation of service charges  and the requirement to create a sink fund. All those issues must be taken on  board.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As some Members have said, it is interesting that Scotland has  regulation. However, some management companies that look after properties in Northern Ireland are registered in Scotland, and  we cannot make them accountable. Several of those issues are merely a matter of  fair play, yet it seems that legislation is necessary to ensure that fair play  is always carried out. For example, it seems obvious that votes should be  allocated on a single-vote-per-unit basis. However, that is not always the  case. Recommendation 14 of the National Consumer Agency&rsquo;s report in October  2006, which is entitled &lsquo;Management Fees and Service Charges Levied on Owners  of Property in Multi-Unit Dwellings&rsquo;, found difficulties with the golden votes  that are held by developers. We are all aware of the film &lsquo;The Man with the Golden  Gun&rsquo;; the people with the golden votes have more power than the man with the  gun.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As was mentioned previously, service charges should be  clearly itemised, and cost categories should be included in the calculation of  a service charge. There should be a formal process, through a general meeting  of the owners&rsquo; management company, for the approval of such service charges.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Other Members have highlighted other areas, and, therefore,  I will not mention those at length. However, it is sufficient to say that we  need a framework. Now is the time to examine the legislation on the mainland  and in the Republic to determine the best way to protect the needs of people in  the Province. The regulation of multi-unit developments and the governance of  management companies in such developments must be improved.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We can learn much from the legislation that has been  enacted on the mainland and in the Republic   of Ireland. The amendment  tightens and strengthens the motion and calls for the development of proposals;  that is the way to approach the issue. I support the amendment, and I hope that  the proposers of the motion take it on board.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: In  supporting the amendment, I will follow my colleague&rsquo;s example and mention a  James Bond movie. I hope that the people with the golden vote will go the same  way as Scaramanga in &lsquo;The Man with the Golden Gun&rsquo;. Unfortunately, James Bond  cannot rescue us on this matter; we will have to rely on legislation, because  that is what will be required. I do not know whether the Minister is playing  the role of Moneypenny in the matter.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to have this debate. As others have said,  the owners of the vast majority of management development companies are  responsible people who provide a service. However, we are all aware &mdash; I am  certainly aware from my constituency &mdash; of situations in which owners of  apartments, town houses and other types of accommodation that are controlled by  such companies have got a raw deal. They have experienced a situation where  charges from management companies have increased without explanation. It is  important to provide proper protection, albeit because of a minority of  companies.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The proposer of the motion said that some people had sought  legal redress. We are not starting out with a blank page in this matter. However,  the law needs to be updated.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Our leasehold law, contract law and land law deal with  complex situations. In many ways, given the situation in Northern Ireland  with regard to the issues at hand, it is not surprising that other  jurisdictions are ahead of us. Our contract law mirrors that of the rest of the  United Kingdom, but land law on the island of Ireland has always been different  from that in Great Britain, and it has diverged to a degree between Northern Ireland  and the Republic of Ireland as a result of almost 90 years of partition. We are  in a complex situation, but there is clearly a need for action to be taken.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Many relevant points have been covered. Mr O&rsquo;Loan said that  there was not a great deal of difference between the amendment and the motion,  and, because he is in favour of the motion, I assume that he will support the  amendment and will avoid dividing the House. There is not a great deal of  distance between the parties&rsquo; positions on the motion, but our amendment makes  two small steps forward that strengthen it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">First, although it is implicit in the motion that new  legislation is needed, the amendment makes it explicit that action should not  simply be taken by Departments and that there should be a direct commitment to  new legislation. Only new legislation can put such action on a statutory basis  and provide a form of statutory protection.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, as has been indicated, new legislation may  require different actions by different Departments in a multi-agency approach.  The proposer of the amendment said that DFP should be involved because of the  law reform aspect. DETI must be involved because there are planning aspects to  consider and, because there could be a degree of overhang into social housing,  DSD might also have a part to play.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We must examine the issue from a joined-up government point  of view. The onus should not be on one Department alone, because a single  Department may not be able to deal adequately with such a matter. The whole  Executive must be involved. I would like to see &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  refer the Member to the wording of the original motion, which:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;calls on the Department of Finance and Personnel and  the Executive to develop proposals on the matter.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member has an extra minute in which to speak.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  That makes my point perfectly, because, even though it mentions the Executive,  the motion singles out one Department, whereas we really need  cross-departmental work to bring forward legislation. That could be achieved by  way of a cross-departmental working group or an Executive subgroup, because  there may have to be several different pieces of legislation. There are  different ways of taking action, but the Executive must ensure that action is  taken together. To place a focus on one Department is the wrong way forward.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I do not believe that there is great deal of distance  between the parties&rsquo; intentions. The aim of the motion and the amendment is to  bring the same thing forward together. The amendment makes an additional  half-step forward, and I appeal to Members to back it. I hope that Members will  not seek to divide the House. The amendment can be married to the best elements  of Mr McCarthy&rsquo;s motion in order to reach an appropriate synergy that will  allow us to stand united and give a degree of protection to owners of  apartments and town houses. I look forward to a strong commitment from the  whole Executive to new legislation.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I call Mr Danny Kinahan.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I will take my chance this time round, and I take  note of the &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  Is your name Danny Kennedy?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  I will be anyone you like, as long as I get the girl and do not get shot or  eaten by sharks. When it comes to James Bond movies, I always feel that I am  likely to be the latter.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I was not planning to speak, but this is a serious and  important matter on which I have been lobbied on several occasions, rather like  my colleagues in South Antrim, by people who  have fallen foul of regulations or the lack of them.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">First, we should praise companies that do their job well,  that deliver services on time and correctly and keep apartment and house owners  well informed. However, there are many places where the process is going wrong,  and regulation and accountability are required. We have seen today that Members  agree broadly on the direction that we should take, albeit that the minor  details are not agreed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">When one is buying a house, it is essential that everything  is explained to the buyer. I hope that, when the proposals become legislation,  owners can have access to such knowledge. A house is probably the biggest  investment that someone will make in their entire life. That investment  involves the homes that people will live in, and they want to be comfortable  with their neighbours and have everything working around them. No one wants a  battle when they go home; people want a nice, simple life. I would like there  to be a checklist that people go through every time they buy a house.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It needs to be made clear where ownership lies. In one or  two cases that I have been involved in, management companies or the original  developer still owned some of the houses, and it has been incredibly difficult  to get everyone together to resolve the problems, because doing so is not  always in everyone&rsquo;s interest. As many Members said, it is important that  everything is insured properly and that services are delivered in an agreed and  timely way.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We also need to ensure that there is a central point from  which to obtain a response. That means that there must be someone who can be  contacted by phone, e-mail or text when things go wrong. There has to be some  central organisation so that, if something goes wrong, one can go home at night  and know that one&rsquo;s problems have been raised and dealt with.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am in two minds as to whether the regulations should be  the responsibility of one Department or spread between Departments. However,  such responsibility certainly falls to the Executive. It was left with me that,  if the case were well argued, I could choose to vote for the amendment rather  than the motion. The argument for the amendment was well made, and it  strengthens the motion. We are all agreed that we want regulations enforced in  legislation. Therefore, I support the amendment and the motion.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel (Mr S Wilson)</strong>: I thank the Members who participated  in the debate. I am not quite clear as to why I am responding, other than to  say that, when I lifted the Order Paper, I found that I had been instructed to  be here to do so. I have no difficulty with that, although I do not necessarily  think that this is primarily a DFP issue. However, I have a particular interest  in the subject, which is one reason why I was not unhappy to be asked to  respond.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am glad that Members quoted liberally from my previous  ruminations on the subject. I was watching the clock when Mr McCarthy was  speaking, and 10% of his speech was a repetition of things that I said  previously on the issue. Therefore, I was very pleased that he offered me that  degree of recognition, although I suspect that it was probably a little prod to  move me along on the issue.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">My natural inclination in many of these matters is not to  impose yet more regulation and red tape. There is a misconception in the press  that, unless we are passing new laws here every day, we are not doing our work.  Sometimes the best thing that the Assembly can do is not to impose and heap on  a greater burden of law. However, in this instance, I believe that there is a  gap in the regulations and a loophole in the law.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will not repeat Members&rsquo; contributions, but it is quite  clear that many people who have invested in a house and spent a lot of money on  a home face a degree of uncertainty. They may find themselves without recourse  to the people who should be looking after the premises, and they may find that,  as a result, they are not getting the services and support that they need. In  many cases, properties are being devalued by actions that the owners have no  control over. We must examine ways to deal with the issue.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  The most important thing is to ensure that apartment owners do not go to bed  thinking that they are covered only to find, after a fire in the apartment  block, for example, that the contract had not been renewed and that they are  not insured. It is vital that the Minister, the Executive and all the Departments  do what is required to prevent that from happening.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Beware of Mr McCarthy&rsquo;s interventions: they are  always an attempt to make another speech, and he has proved that again.  Nevertheless, he has made an important point that Members have already raised.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The complexity of the matter has been indicated by the  range of issues that have been raised in the debate. Those issues include land  ownership, company law, general contract law, consumer protection law and even  planning. There is no easy answer, and that is one of the reasons why the  matter has fallen through the gaps until now. The range of issues also means  that the matter concerns a range of Departments, and I will come to that later.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Two approaches to dealing with the matter have been  mentioned. The first of those comes from Part 2 of the Commonhold and Leasehold  Reform Act 2002 in England  and Wales.  That approach has come in for some criticism because, although it gives people  who live in apartments and multi-unit dwellings the right to manage, it does  not regulate their management strongly. It is OK to give the people who live in  an apartment block the right to manage that block themselves rather than have  it managed by a management company, but there must be some degree of regulation  and certainty. There is no guarantee that those people will be competent or  that they will do the job well. That is why the Irish Republic  is considering instead the regulation and governance of management companies.  Consideration of the two approaches again shows that there is not simply one  solution.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Members referred to the role of the Law Commission. I know  that Mr McCarthy has been involved in discussions with the Law Commission,  because he intended to bring this matter forward in a private Member&rsquo;s Bill at  one stage. He did not explain why that approach was not pursued, but I suspect  that one reason was the complexity of the matter and the fact that there is no  easy answer.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Law Commission indicated that, as a result of  representations, it is a possible topic for inclusion in the first programme  for law reform; I understand that that is as far as the matter has gone. I am  quite happy for the Law Commission to do work on that to highlight the issues, but  I suspect that it will consider the matter more from the perspective of land  ownership than from that of the other regulation that will be required.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As a range of Departments are involved, I would like a  number of steps to be taken. I am happy to get permanent secretaries and  Ministers from all Departments &mdash; five Departments have been mentioned so far in  the debate &mdash; to determine who should take the lead on the issue. That is not to  pass the buck: we have to be clear about the direction in which we want to go.  We need to ascertain whether the matter is essentially one of housing, land  reform or the regulation of companies. There will also be peripheral interest  from the Department of the Environment because planning is involved, but the  first step, which I will take as a result of the Assembly debate today, is to  get together all the Departments that may have a legitimate interest in the  issue.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A number of issues was raised today, and Members regard  some of them as more important than others. Work is required to determine the  specific issues that need to be addressed. If the Law Commission makes the  matter one of its topics, I have no doubt that it will have an input in  identifying some of the issues through the work that it does. Departments can  do that also.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Although MLAs seem to have a fairly good grasp of the  issues, the process will be done through inviting evidence. As Members pointed  out, not all management organisations do a bad job. Indeed, they see the  cowboys who operate in the industry and they may have views about the kind of  things that they want stopped so that not everybody&rsquo;s reputation is sullied.  Equally, residents and those who have to buy the services of management  companies will have an input as well.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Once that work is done, there will be a need to make  recommendations. There will probably be consultation on the recommendations  because they will inform whatever legislation is eventually brought forward.  There is then the issue of analysing any outcome from that consultation until  we get to the point at which we have draft legislation, which will again have  to be consulted on &mdash; that is a requirement &mdash; before it gets to the Assembly.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That is some of the work that needs to be done. I thought  that I would take some time to outline what needed to be done. I understand the  concerns of those who live with uncertainty, but, time and time again, we raise  expectations that matters can be remedied swiftly. Sometimes MLAs fuel that  notion, especially in relation to complex issues.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  I know the direction in which the Minister is going. Although we do not have  regulation, does he accept that what he said about addressing the issue with  Departments is, in its own right, an assurance that we are starting the  process, as opposed to what happened over the past number of years when it was  not addressed at all?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I hope that the tenor of my speech indicates that I  was not dragged kicking and screaming into the Assembly to deal with this issue  today, even though there may be some debate about whether the issue rests  mostly with my Department. There are other Ministers who, when it comes to  allocating time in the Executive, look for every excuse not to appear in the  Assembly to give their views and respond to the issues. That has not been my approach.  By outlining the issues and responsibilities and by trying to plot a way  forward, I hope that I am giving an indication that I want to see resources  devoted to this matter. I want to see this issue resolved because it no longer  affects only a small number of people in Northern Ireland. As apartment  living has become more prevalent, more people are being caught up in the issues  raised in the debate. I hope that what I have said has done three things:  first, shown my commitment; secondly, outlined the complexities involved; and,  thirdly, shown the way forward.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that Members and constituents who are listening to  the debate and who may have a stake in something being done will understand  that these things will not be sorted out by the click of my fingers. If that  were possible, I would be more than happy to do it. When we go down the  legislative route, there is a process that must be followed. There is no point  in having half-cocked legislation that does not resolve the issue.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I do not want to fault Westminster,  but there has been criticism of the legislation for England  and Wales,  perhaps for not looking at the whole range of issues involved. If we are going  to do the job, let us do it right. I commit myself to seeking to bring along  other Ministers to try to address the matter. It may not be an earth-shattering  issue, but it once again illustrates the value of having an Assembly at  Stormont to which MLAs can bring their constituents&rsquo; concerns, to be considered  in a sensible manner by those who are responsible for Departments, regulations  and legislation with a view to resolving them.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: The  Minister said it best when he talked about the perception that Stormont needs  to produce more legislation, and he was right to say that it is not about  getting more legislation: it is about getting good legislation. Some sort of  legislation to deal with this issue would be very welcome. That is why my party  welcomes the debate and, as my colleague Trevor Clarke said, we tabled a very  similar motion and had approached the Alliance Party to see if we could table a  joint motion. Nonetheless, we are where we are and we welcome today&rsquo;s debate.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The problems faced by people right across the country are  clear from the debate. It is important to say that not all management companies  are at fault, but the reports that we hear generally concern the bad ones. That  echoes a recent BBC report asking how many of the 1&middot;6 million people throughout  the United Kingdom with leasehold property would ask whether they are getting  value for money from their management companies, where the money that they pay  is going and what it is used for.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Similar issues have been raised with me in my constituency,  not least in Castlerocklands in Carrickfergus and in Craigstown Meadow in  Magheramorne. Nearly all apartment and many new residential developments  require a management agreement because common open spaces need to be  maintained, which leads to the creation of management companies to look after  the cleaning, maintenance, painting and other work.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">However, the experience of many people has been bad. They  have found the management companies unresponsive. The companies have gone bust,  are not showing accounts or are not meeting residents. As we heard from Mr  Clarke and from Mr McCarthy, many residents realise that there is no insurance  for their buildings, which puts them at serious risk.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I  will not give way because I have only five minutes, I do not get any additional  time, and I want to make progress.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Kinahan said that there was no guarantee of quality of  service for the money paid by residents to these companies, which can be  anything from &pound;100 to thousands of pounds annually. The lack of any real  scrutiny of those companies must be looked at. Indeed, as my colleague Mr  Clarke again said, in many cases there is no consultation about increases in  the amount that must be paid to such companies.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The issue has always been that no specific legislation  exists in Northern Ireland  to regulate management companies, which, over the years, have been largely  self-regulating. In recent years, as we have had more apartments and  residential developments, the problem has become more acute.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">5.00 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As we heard in Mr Weir&rsquo;s contribution, the situation in Northern Ireland  is complicated by company law, consumer protection laws and outdated property  laws here. In essence, the DUP amendment is saying that not just one but a wide  range of Departments have an interest in the subject. We heard about the DOE,  and I wrote to the Minister of Finance and Personnel when he was in his former  post. He helpfully replied citing PPS 8 policy OS 2, &lsquo;Public Open Space in New  Residential Development&rsquo;.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We heard that DETI has a role to play, and, when I  contacted the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, she pointed to some  of the legislation about which we have heard, including the Commonhold and  Leasehold Reform Act 2002. We know that that legislation has not been very  successful because an all-party group on land management has been established  in the House of Commons with a view to changing the law. I have communicated  with Gordon Banks, the secretary of that group, to discuss the issue.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Although the amendment reflects the fact that it is unclear  where responsibility lies, it nonetheless asserts the need for legislation, and  that is the important thing that must come from the debate. In fact, when I  asked Mr O&rsquo;Loan which Committee should consider the matter, I was not trying to  trick him; I was highlighting the fact that it is not clear which Department  should take the lead, and that confirms the need for the amendment.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s contribution and his commitment to  establishing a cross-departmental subgroup to bring forward legislation. That  is very important, and Members from all parties will be able to support the  amendment in the knowledge that the DUP is not ducking the issue; rather, the  Minister will set up a subgroup to drive the matter forward.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Several Members mentioned the Law Commission, and I know  from correspondence with it that it recognises that this is a difficult legal  issue that is in need of review. It hopes, with the Secretary of State&rsquo;s  approval, to bring forward a review and some suggestions by early 2011. I hope  that the Assembly will unite behind the DUP&rsquo;s amendment and that we can get  that process moving.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: The  Alliance Party does not support the amendment, which does not add anything to  the motion. I reiterate that the motion:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;calls on the Department of Finance and Personnel and  the Executive to develop proposals on the matter.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That, therefore, includes all Ministers.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Nearly every Member who spoke acknowledged the problems  that the lack of legislation and regulation cause, and nearly everyone spoke  about cases in their own constituency. Like other Members, I have encountered a  lot of complaints on the subject, but I am able to mention one happy story from  my constituency, involving a constituent who, through sheer tenacity, managed  to unite 100 of her fellow apartment owners against their management agent  until, finally, after overcoming many obstacles, they were able to get rid of  the agent and hire a new one. Nevertheless, in the process, they lost tens of  thousands of pounds, which, obviously, is outrageous.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I shall now summarise Members&rsquo; comments. First, I thank the  Minister for giving a commitment to look at the issue, and I welcome the  measures that he put forward to bring the five Departments together to discuss  which should take the lead and the range of issues that must be addressed. In  addition, before making recommendations, they must talk to other stakeholders.  The Alliance Party will certainly be happy to work and co-operate with the  Minister on that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Kieran McCarthy examined the issue over the past year and  is preparing for draft legislation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McLaughlin called for a united front in the Assembly to  deal with the problem. He said that there are sufficient grounds to legislate  to address the issue and the associated abuses.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Kennedy mentioned the need for a sinking fund. He said  that the lack of regulation and a legal framework can also prejudice the resale  of houses for some apartment owners. He called for more flexibility to allow  owners to manage communal areas.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr O&rsquo;Loan spoke about the Multi-Unit Developments Bill 2009  in the Republic. He commented that there has been little mention of the issue  in the Assembly and little interest has been shown by the current Minister of  the Environment or any previous Minister. He urged that the proposal be tested  in Committee before being put before the Assembly, a suggestion that attracted  many interventions.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Shannon said that more young people want to buy apartments.  Apartments are more affordable and more suitable for the needs of young people,  but there is inadequate regulation so the problem in Northern Ireland must be addressed.  He mentioned several cases, and he called for a framework to protect apartment  owners. He also spoke about the costs of upkeep, maintenance and insurance  cover.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Weir said that many apartment owners have a raw deal and  that they pay increasingly expensive charges but do not receive quality work in  return. He called for the law to be updated. He admitted that it is a complex  situation and stressed that other jurisdictions are ahead of us and that we  need to consider the problem in that context.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Kinahan mentioned other cases and said that, for many  people, buying a house is the largest transaction that they would ever make.  There must be a checklist, and those buyers need to be protected. He described  the difficulties that developers and management companies face. Sometimes, it  is unclear who owns which part of the communal areas in apartment blocks. I  have seen examples of that in south Belfast.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I turn to the Minister&rsquo;s contribution. I have just been  passed a note to say that we want to thank Mr Wilson for his very positive  contribution. I thought that I had mentioned that; I do not need to be  reminded. Thank you, Mr Wilson.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am optimistic. Mr McCarthy, my colleagues and I have  received written testimony from hundreds of apartment owners and management  agents from all over Northern Ireland, and we hope that the draft Bill will  solve the problem. I am confident that it will save apartment owners much money  and much heartache.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Question, That the amendment be made, <span class="Italic">put  and agreed to.</span></p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Main Question, as amended, put and agreed to.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly notes that the regulations on multi-unit  development management companies are not currently adequate and calls on the  Executive to introduce new legislation that will govern the way in which they  operate.</p>
